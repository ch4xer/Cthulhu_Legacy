        "content": "Too far away is her wan and mortal face, and too remote are the snows of her unimaginable breast, for mine eyes to behold them ever. But at whiles her whisper comes to me, like a chill unearthly wind that is faint from traversing the gulfs between the worlds and the ultimate white horizons of icy deserts. And she speaks to me in a tongue I have never heard, but have always known; and she tells of deathly things and of things beautiful beyond the ecstatic desires of love. Her speech is not of good or evil, nor of anything that is desired or conceived or believed by the termites of earth; and the air she breathes, and the lands wherein she roams, would blast like the utter cold of sidereal space; and her eyes would blind the vision of men like suns; and her kiss, if one should ever attain it, would wither and slay like the kiss of lightning.\n\nBut, hearing her far, infrequent whisper, I behold a vision of vast auroras, on continents that are wider than the world, and seas too great for the enterprise of human keels. And at times I stammer forth the strange tidings that she brings: though none will welcome them, and none will believe or listen. And in some dawn of the desperate years, I shall go forth and follow where she calls, to seek the high and beatific doom of her pure inviolable distances, to perish amid her indesecrate horizons.",
        "content_cn": "她那苍白如死灰的面容太过遥远，那不可想象的胸脯上的皑皑雪原更是遥不可及，凡胎肉眼永远无法窥见。但偶尔，她的低语会乘着阴森非尘世的风飘来，那风因横渡世界间的深渊与冰封荒原尽头的苍白地平线而气若游丝。她用一种我从未听过却始终知晓的语言对我诉说，讲述着死亡之物与美得超越爱情狂喜渴望的存在。她的言辞无关善恶，亦非尘世蝼蚁所渴求、构想或信仰的任何事物；她呼吸的空气，她徜徉的土地，会像星际虚空般将人冻成齑粉；她的双眸会如烈日般灼瞎凡人的视线；她的吻——倘若有人能侥幸得到——将如闪电之吻般令人枯萎毙命。\n\n然而，当我听见她那遥远稀微的耳语时，眼前便浮现出横跨比世界更辽阔大陆的极光，以及人类船只永远无法征服的浩瀚海洋。有时我结结巴巴地转述她带来的诡异讯息，尽管无人愿意接纳，无人愿意相信或倾听。在某个绝望之年的黎明，我将循着她的召唤启程，追寻她纯净无瑕的远方那崇高至福的毁灭，在她神圣不可亵渎的地平线上迎来湮灭。"

        "title": "The Tale of Satampra Zeiros",
        "content": "\n\nI, Satampra Zeiros of Uzuldaroum, shall write with my left hand, since I have no longer any other, the tale of everything that befell Tirouv Ompallios and myself in the shrine of the god Tsathoggua, which lies neglected by the worship of man in the jungle-taken suburbs of Commoriom, that long-deserted capital of the Hyperborean rulers. I shall write it with the violet juice of the suvana-palm, which turns to a blood-red rubric with the passage of years, on a strong vellum that is made from the skin of the mastodon, as a warning to all good thieves and adventurers who may hear some lying legend of the lost treasures of Commoriom and be tempted thereby.\n\nNow, Tirouv Ompallios was my life-long friend and my trustworthy companion in all such enterprises as require deft fingers and a habit of mind both agile and adroit. I can say without flattering myself, or Tirouv Ompallios either, that we carried to an incomparable success more than one undertaking from which fellow-craftsmen of a much wider renown than ourselves might well have recoiled in dismay. To be more explicit, I refer to the theft of the jewels of Queen Cunambria, which were kept in a room where two-score venomous reptiles wandered at will; and the breaking of the adamantine box of Acromi, in which were all the medallions of an early dynasty of Hyperborean kings. It is true that these medallions were difficult and perilous to dispose of, and that we sold them at a dire sacrifice to the captain of a barbarian vessel from remote Lemuria: but nevertheless, the breaking of that box was a glorious feat, for it had to be done in absolute silence, on account of the proximity of a dozen guards who were all armed with tridents. We made use of a rare and mordant acid . . . but I must not linger too long and too garrulously by the way, however great the temptation to ramble on amid heroic memories and the high glamor of valiant or sleightful deeds.\n\nIn our occupation, as in all others, the vicissitudes of fortune are oftentimes to be reckoned with; and the goddess Chance is not always prodigal of her favors. So it was that Tirouv Ompallios and I, at the time of which I write, had found ourselves in a condition of pecuniary depletion, which, though temporary, was nevertheless extreme, and was quite inconvenient and annoying, coming as it did on the heel of more prosperous days, of more profitable midnights. People had become accursedly chary of their jewels and other valuables, windows and doors were double-barred, new and perplexing locks were in use, guards had grown more vigilant or less somnolent,—in short, all the natural difficulties of our profession had multiplied themselves. At one time we were reduced to the stealing of more bulky and less precious merchandise than that in which we customarily dealt; and even this had its dangers. Even now, it humiliates me to remember the night when we were nearly caught with a sack of red yams; and I mention all this that I may not seem in any wise vainglorious.\n\nOne evening, in an alley of the more humble quarter of Uzuldaroum, we stopped to count our available resources, and found that we had between us exactly three pazoors—enough to buy a large bottle of pomegranate wine or two loaves of bread. We debated the problem of expenditure.\n\n\"The bread,\" contended Tirouv Ompallios, \"will nurture our bodies, will lend a new and more expeditious force to our spent limbs, and our toilworn fingers.\"\n\n\"The pomegranate wine,\" said 1, \"will ennoble our thoughts, will inspire and illuminate our minds, and perchance will reveal to us a mode of escape from our present difficulties.\"\n\nTirouv Ompallios yielded without undue argument to my superior reasoning, and we sought the doors of an adjacent tavern. The wine was not of the best, in regard to flavor, but the quantity and strength were all that could be desired. We sat in the crowded tavern, and sipped it at leisure, till all the fire of the bright red liquor had transferred itself to our brains. The darkness and dubiety of our future ways became illumined as by the light of rosy cressets, and the harsh aspect of the world was marvellously softened. Anon, there came to me an inspiration.\n\n\"Tirouv Ompallios,\" I said, \"is there any reason why you and I, who are brave men and nowise subject to the fears and superstitions of the multitude, should not avail ourselves of the kingly treasures of Commoriom? A day's journey from this tiresome town, a pleasant sojourn in the country, an afternoon or forenoon of archaeological research—and who knows what we should find?\"\n\n\"You speak wisely and valiantly, my dear friend,\" rejoined Tirouv Ompallios. \"Indeed, there is no reason why we should not replenish our deflated finances at the expense of a few dead kings or gods.\"\n\nNow Commoriom, as all the world knows, was deserted many hundred years ago because of the prophecy of the White Sybil of Polarion, who foretold an undescribed and abominable doom for all mortal beings who should dare to tarry within its environs. Some say that this doom was a pestilence that would have come from the northern waste by the paths of the jungle tribes; others, that it was a form of madness; at any rate, no one, neither king nor priest nor merchant nor laborer nor thief, remained in Commoriom to abide its arrival, but all departed in a single migration to found at the distance of a day's journey the new capital, Uzuldaroum. And strange tales are told, of horrors and terrors not to be faced or overcome by man, that haunt forevermore the shrines and mausoleums and palaces of Commoriom. And still it stands, a luster of marble, a magnificence of granite, all a-throng with spires and cupolas and obelisks that the mighty trees of the jungle have not yet overtowered, in a fertile inland valley of Hyperborea. And men say that in its unbroken vaults there lies entire and undespoiled as of yore the rich treasure of olden monarchs; that the high-built tombs retain the gems and electrum that were buried with their mummies; that the fanes have still their golden altar-vessels and furnishings, the idols their precious stones in ear and mouth and nostril and navel.\n\nI think that we should have set out that very night, if we had only had the encouragement and inspiration of a second bottle of pomegranate wine. As it was, we decided to start at early dawn: the fact that we had no funds for our journey was of small moment, for, unless our former dexterity had altogether failed us, we could levy a modicum of involuntary tribute from the guileless folk of the country-side. In the meanwhile, we repaired to our lodgings, where the landlord met us with a grudging welcome and a most ungracious demand for his money. But the golden promise of the morrow had armed us against all such trivial annoyances, and we waved the fellow aside with a disdain that appeared to astonish if not to subdue him.\n\nWe slept late, and the sun had ascended far upon the azure acclivity of the heavens when we left the gates of Uzuldaroum and took the northern road that leads toward Commoriom. We breakfasted well on some amber melons, and a stolen fowl that we cooked in the woods, and then resumed our wayfaring. In spite of a fatigue that increased upon us toward the end of the day, our trip was a pleasurable one, and we found much to divert us in the varying landscapes through which we passed, and in their people. Some of these people, I am sure, must still remember us with regret, for we did not deny ourselves anything procurable that tempted our fancy or our appetites.\n\nIt was an agreeable country, full of farms and orchards and running waters and green, flowery woods. At last, somewhile in the course of the afternoon, we came to the ancient road, long disused and well-nigh overgrown, which runs from the highway through the elder jungle to Commoriom.\n\nNo one saw us enter this road, and thenceforward we met no one. At a single step, we passed from all human ken; and it seemed that the silence of the forest around us had lain unstirred by mortal footfall ever since the departure of the legendary king and his people so many centuries before. The trees were vaster than any we had ever seen, they were interwoven by the endless labyrinthine volumes, the eternal web-like convolutions of creepers almost as old as they themselves. The flowers were unwholesomely large, their petals bore a lethal pallor or a sanguinary scarlet; and their perfumes were overpoweringly sweet or fetid. The fruits along our way were of great size, with purple and orange and russet colors, but somehow we did not dare to eat them.\n\nThe woods grew thicker and more rampant as we went on, and the road, though paved with granite slabs, was more and more overgrown, for trees had rooted themselves in the interstices, often forcing the wide blocks apart. Though the sun had not yet neared the horizon, the shades that were cast upon us from gigantic boles and branches became ever denser, and we moved in a dark-green twilight fraught with oppressive odors of lush growth and of vegetable corruption. There were no birds nor animals, such as one would think to find in any wholesome forest, but at rare intervals a stealthy viper with pale and heavy coils glided away from our feet among the rank leaves of the roadside, or some enormous moth with baroque and evil-colored mottlings flew before us and disappeared in the dimness of the jungle. Abroad already in the half-light, huge purpureal bats with eyes like tiny rubies arose at our approach from the poisonous-looking fruits on which they feasted, and watched us with malign attention as they hovered noiselessly in the air above. And we felt, somehow, that we were being watched by other and invisible presences; and a sort of awe fell upon us, and a vague fear of the monstrous jungle; and we no longer spoke aloud, or frequently, but only in rare whispers.\n\nAmong other things, we had contrived to procure along our way a large leathern bottle full of palm-spirit. A few sips of the ardent liquor had already served to lighten more than once the tedium of our journey; and now it was to stand us in good stead. Each of us drank a liberal draught, and presently the jungle became less awesome; and we wondered why we had allowed the silence and the gloom, the watchful bats and the brooding immensity, to weigh upon our spirits even for a brief while; and I think that after a second draught we began to sing.\n\nWhen twilight came, and a waxing moon shone high in the heavens after the hidden daystar had gone down, we were so imbued with the fervor of adventure that we decided to push on and reach Commoriom that very night. We supped on food that we had levied from the country-people, and the leathern bottle passed between us several times. Then, considerably fortified, and replete with hardihood and the valor of a lofty enterprise, we resumed our journeying.\n\nIndeed, we had not much farther to go. Even as we were debating between ourselves, with an ardor that made us oblivious of our long wayfaring, what costly loot we would first choose from among all the mythical treasures of Commoriom, we saw in the moonlight the gleam of marble cupolas above the tree-tops, and then between the boughs and boles the wan pillars of shadowy porticoes. A few more steps, and we trod upon paven streets that ran transversely from the high-road we were following, into the tall, luxuriant woods on either side, where the fronds of mighty palmferns overtopped the roofs of ancient houses.\n\nWe paused, and again the silence of an elder desolation claimed our lips. For the houses were white and still as sepulchers, and the deep shadows that lay around and upon them were chill and sinister and mysterious as the very shadow of death. It seemed that the sun could not have shone for ages in this place—that nothing warmer than the spectral beams of the cadaverous moon had touched the marble and granite ever since that universal migration prompted by the prophecy of the White Sybil of Polarion.\n\n\"I wish it were daylight,\" murmured Tirouv Ompallios. His low tones were oddly sibilant, were unnaturally audible in the dead stillness. \"Tirouv Ompallios,\" I replied, \"I trust that you are not growing superstitious. I should be loth to think that you are succumbing to the infantile fancies of the multitude. Howbeit, let us have another drink.\"\n\nWe lightened the leathern bottle appreciably by the demand we now made upon its contents, and were marvellously cheered thereby—so much so, indeed, that we forthwith started to explore a left-hand avenue, which, though it had been laid out with mathematical directness, vanished at no great distance among the fronded trees. Here, somewhat apart from the other buildings, in a sort of square that the jungle had not yet wholly usurped, we found a small temple of antique architecture which gave the impression of being far older even than the adjoining edifices. It also differed from these in its material, for it was builded of a dark basaltic stone heavily encrusted with lichens that seemed of a coeval antiquity. It was square in form, and had no domes nor spires, no façade of pillars, and only a few narrow windows high above the ground. Such temples are rare in Hyperborea now-a-days; but we knew it for a shrine of Tsathoggua, one of the elder gods, who receives no longer any worship from men, but before whose ashen altars, people say, the furtive and ferocious beasts of the jungle, the ape, the giant sloth and the long-toothed tiger, have sometimes been seen to make obeisance and have been heard to howl or whine their inarticulate prayers.\n\nThe temple, like the other buildings, was in a state of well-nigh perfect preservation: the only signs of decay were in the carven lintel of the door, which had crumbled and splintered away in several places. The door itself, wrought of a swarthy bronze all overgreened by time, stood slightly a-jar. Knowing that there should be a jewelled idol within, not to mention the various altar-pieces of valuable metals, we felt the urge of temptation.\n\nSurmising that strength might be required to force open the verdigris-covered door, we drank deeply, and then applied ourselves to the task. Of course, the hinges were rusted; and only by dint of mighty and muscular heavings did the door at last begin to move. As we renewed our efforts, it swung slowly inward with a hideous grating and grinding that mounted to an almost vocal screech, in which we seemed to hear the tones of some unhuman entity. The black interior of the temple yawned before us, and from it there surged an odor of long-imprisoned mustiness combined with a queer and unfamiliar fetidity. To this, however, we gave little heed in the natural excitement of the moment.\n\nWith my usual foresight, I had provided myself with a piece of resinous wood earlier in the day, thinking that it might serve as a torch in case of any nocturnal explorations of Commoriom. I lit this torch, and we entered the shrine.\n\nThe place was paven with immense quinquangular flags of the same material from which its walls were built. It was quite bare, except for the image of the god enthroned at the further end, the two-tiered altar of obscenely-figured metal before the image, and a large and curious-looking basin of bronze supported on three legs, which occupied the middle of the floor. Giving this basin hardly a glance, we ran forward, and I thrust my torch into the face of the idol.\n\nI had never seen an image of Tsathoggua before, but I recognized him without difficulty from the descriptions I had heard. He was very squat and pot-bellied, his head was more like that of a monstrous toad than a deity, and his whole body was covered with an imitation of short fur, giving somehow a vague suggestion of both the bat and the sloth. His sleepy lids were half-lowered over his globular eyes; and the tip of a queer tongue issued from his fat mouth. In truth, he was not a comely or personable sort of god, and I did not wonder at the cessation of his worship, which could only have appealed to very brutal and aboriginal men at any time.\n\nTirouv Ompallios and I began to swear simultaneously by the names of more urbane and civilized deities, when we saw that not even the commonest of semi-precious gems was visible anywhere, either upon or within any feature or member of this execrable image. With a niggardliness beyond parallel, even the eyes had been carven from the same dull stone as the rest of the abominable thing, and mouth, nose, ears and all other orifices were unadorned. We could only wonder at the avarice or poverty of the beings who had wrought this unique bestiality.\n\nNow that our minds were no longer enthralled by the hope of immediate riches, we became more keenly aware of our surroundings in general; and in particular we noticed the unfamiliar fetor I have spoken of previously, which had now increased uncomfortably in strength. We found that it came from the bronze basin, which we proceeded to examine, though without any idea that the examination would be profitable or even pleasant.\n\nThe basin, I have said, was very large; indeed, it was no less than six feet in diameter by three in depth, and its brim was the height of a tall man's shoulder from the floor. The three legs that bore it were curved and massive and terminated in feline paws displaying their talons. When we approached and peered over the brim, we saw that the bowl was filled with a sort of viscous and semi-liquescent substance, quite opaque and of a sooty color. It was from this that the odor came—an odor which, though unsurpassably foul, was nevertheless not an odor of putrefaction, but resembled rather the smell of some vile and unclean creature of the marshes. The odor was almost beyond endurance, and we were about to turn away when we perceived a slight ebullition of the surface, as if the sooty liquid were being agitated from within by some submerged animal or other entity. This ebullition increased rapidly, the center swelled as if with the action of some powerful yeast, and we watched in utter horror, while an uncouth amorphous head with dull and bulging eyes arose gradually on an ever-lengthening neck, and stared us in the face with primordial malignity. Then two arms—if one could call them arms—likewise arose inch by inch, and we saw that the thing was not, as we had thought, a creature immersed in the liquid, but that the liquid itself had put forth this hideous neck and head, and was now forming these damnable arms, that groped toward us with tentacle-like appendages in lieu of claws or hands!\n\nA fear which we had never experienced even in dreams, of which we had found no hint in our most perilous nocturnal excursions, deprived us of the faculty of speech, but not of movement. We recoiled a few paces from the bowl, and co-incidentally with our steps, the horrible neck and arms continued to lengthen. Then the whole mass of the dark fluid began to rise, and far more quickly than the suvana-juice runs from my pen, it poured over the rim of the basin like a torrent of black quicksilver, taking as it reached the floor an undulant ophidian form which immediately developed more than a dozen short legs.\n\nWhat unimaginable horror of protoplastic life, what loathly spawn of the primordial slime had come forth to confront us, we did not pause to consider or conjecture. The monstrosity was too awful to permit of even a brief contemplation; also, its intentions were too plainly hostile, and it gave evidence of anthropophagic inclinations; for it slithered toward us with an unbelievable speed and celerity of motion, opening as it came a toothless mouth of amazing capacity. As it gaped upon us, revealing a tongue that uncoiled like a long serpent, its jaws widened with the same extreme elasticity that accompanied all its other movements. We saw that our departure from the fane of Tsathoggua had become most imperative, and turning our backs to all the abominations of that unhallowed shrine, we crossed the sill with a single leap, and ran headlong in the moonlight through the suburbs of Commoriom. We rounded every convenient corner, we doubled upon our tracks behind the palaces of time-forgotten nobles and the ware-houses of unrecorded merchants, we chose preferably the places where the incursive jungle trees were highest and thickest; and at last, on a by-road where the outlying houses were no longer visible, we paused and dared to look back.\n\nOur lungs were intolerably strained, were ready to burst with their heroic effort, and the various fatigues of the day had told upon us all too grievously; but when we saw at our heels the black monster, following us with a serpentine and undulating ease, like a torrent that descends a long declivity, our flagging limbs were miraculously re-animated, and we plunged from the betraying light of the by-road into the pathless jungle, hoping to evade our pursuer in the labyrinth of boles and vines and gigantic leaves. We stumbled over roots and fallen trees, we tore our raiment and lacerated our skins on the savage brambles, we collided in the gloom with huge trunks and limber saplings that bent before us, we heard the hissing of tree-snakes that spat their venom at us from the boughs above, and the grunting or howling of unseen animals when we trod upon them in our precipitate flight. But we no longer dared to stop or look behind.\n\nWe must have continued our headlong peregrinations for hours. The moon, which had given us little light at best through the heavy leafage, fell lower and lower among the enormous-fronded palms and intricate creepers. But its final rays, when it sank, were all that saved us from a noisome marsh with mounds and hassocks of bog-concealing grass, amid whose perilous environs and along whose mephitic rim we were compelled to run without pause or hesitation or time to choose our footing, with our damnable pursuer dogging every step.\n\nNow, when the moon had gone down, our flight became wilder and more hazardous—a veritable delirium of terror, exhaustion, confusion, and desperate difficult progression among obstacles to which we gave no longer any distinct heed or comprehension, through a night that clung to us and clogged us like an evil load, like the toils of a monstrous web. It would seem that the creature behind us, with its unbelievable facilities of motion and self-elongation, could have overtaken us at any time; but apparently it desired to prolong the game. And so, in a semi-eternal protraction of inconclusive horrors, the night wore on . . . But we never dared to stop or look back.\n\nFar-off and wan, a glimmering twilight grew among the trees—a foreomening of the hidden morn. Wearier than the dead, and longing for any repose, any security, even that of some indiscernible tomb, we ran toward the light, and stumbled forth from the jungle upon a paven street among marble and granite buildings. Dimly, dully, beneath the crushing of our fatigue, we realized that we had wandered in a circle and had come back to the suburbs of Commoriom. Before us, no farther away than the toss of a javelin, was the dark temple of Tsathoggua.\n\nAgain we ventured to look back, and saw the elastic monster, whose legs had now lengthened till it towered above us, and whose maw was wide enough to have swallowed us both at a mouthful. It followed us with an effortless glide, with a surety of motion and intention too horrible, too cynical to be borne. We ran into the temple of Tsathoggua, whose door was still open just as we had left it, and closing the door behind us with a fearful immediacy, we contrived, in the superhuman strength of our desperation, to shoot one of the rusty bolts.\n\nNow, while the chill drearness of the dawn fell down in narrow shafts through the windows high in the wall, we tried with a truly heroic resignation to compose ourselves, and waited for whatever our destiny should bring. And while we waited, the god Tsathoggua peered upon us with an even more imbecile squatness and vileness and bestiality than he had shown in the torchlight.\n\nI think I have said that the lintel of the door had crumbled and splintered away in several places. In fact, the beginning process of ruin had made three apertures, through which the daylight now filtered, and which were large enough to have permitted the passage of small animals or sizable serpents. For some reason, our eyes were drawn to these apertures.\n\nWe had not gazed long, when the light was suddenly intercepted in all three openings, and then a black material began to pour through them and ran down the door in a triple stream to the flagstones, where it re-united and resumed the form of the thing that had followed us.\n\n\"Farewell, Tirouv Ompallios,\" I cried, with such remaining breath as I could summon. Then I ran and concealed myself behind the image of Tsathoggua, which was large enough to screen me from view, but, unfortunately, was too small to serve this purpose for more than one person. Tirouv Ompallios would have preceded me with the same laudable idea of self-preservation, but I was the quicker. And seeing that there was not room for both of us to the rearward of Tsathoggua, he returned my valediction and climbed into the great bronze basin, which alone could now afford a moment's concealment in the bareness of the fane.\n\nPeering from behind that execrable god, whose one merit was the width of his abdomen and his haunches, I observed the actions of the monster. No sooner had Tirouv Ompallios crouched down in the three-legged bowl, when the nameless enormity reared itself up like a sooty pillar and approached the basin. The head had now changed in form and position, till it was no more than a vague imprint of features on the middle of a body without arms, legs or neck. The thing loomed above the brim for an instant, gathering all its bulk in an imminent mass on a sort of tapering tail, and then like a lapsing wave it fell into the bowl upon Tirouv Ompallios. Its whole body seemed to open and form an immense mouth as it sank down from sight.\n\nHardly able to breathe in my horror, I waited, but no sound and no movement came from the basin—not even a groan from Tirouv Ompallios. Finally, with infinite slowness and trepidation and caution, I ventured to emerge from behind Tsathoggua, and passing the bowl on tip-toe, I managed to reach the door.\n\nNow, in order to win my freedom, it would be necessary to draw back the bolt and open the door. And this I greatly feared to do because of the inevitable noise. I felt that it would be highly injudicious to disturb the entity in the bowl while it was digesting Tirouv Ompallios; but there seemed to be no other way if I was ever to leave that abominable fane.\n\nEven as I shot back the bolt, a single tentacle sprang out with infernal rapidity from the basin, and elongating itself across the whole room, it caught my right wrist in a lethal clutch. It was unlike anything I have ever touched, it was indescribably viscid and slimy and cold, it was loathsomely soft like the foul mire of a bog and mordantly sharp as an edged metal, with an agonizing suction and constriction that made me scream aloud as the clutch tightened upon my flesh, cutting into me like a vise of knife-blades. In my struggles to free myself, I drew the door open, and fell forward on the sill. A moment of awful pain, and then I became aware that I had broken away from my captor. But looking down, I saw that my hand was gone, leaving a strangely withered stump from which little blood issued. Then, gazing behind me into the shrine, I saw the tentacle recoil and shorten till it passed from view behind the rim of the basin, bearing my lost hand to join whatever now remained of Tirouv Ompallios.",
        "content_cn": "我，乌祖尔达鲁姆的萨坦普拉·泽罗斯，将用左手写下这一切——因为我已失去右手——关于我和提鲁夫·奥姆帕里奥斯在札特瓜神庙遭遇的全部经历。那座被人类遗忘的神庙，如今湮没在科摩里奥姆郊外的丛林中，那座早已废弃的北极统治者之都。我将用苏瓦纳棕榈的紫色汁液书写，这种墨水会随着岁月流逝化作血红色，写在由乳齿象皮制成的坚韧羊皮纸上，作为对所有听闻科摩里奥姆失落宝藏传说而心生贪念的盗贼与冒险者的警示。\n\n提鲁夫·奥姆帕里奥斯是我毕生挚友，也是所有需要灵巧手指与敏捷头脑的行动中最可靠的搭档。我敢毫不自夸地说——对他亦是如此——我们曾多次完成令那些声名远播的同业者望而却步的壮举。更确切地说，我指的是从游走着四十条毒蛇的房间里盗取库南布里亚女王的珠宝，以及打开北极远古王朝全套徽章所在的阿克罗米金刚石匣。虽然那些徽章难以脱手，最终只能贱卖给来自遥远雷姆利亚的蛮族船长，但那次开匣行动仍是辉煌战绩——当时十二名手持三叉戟的守卫近在咫尺，我们却凭借稀有腐蚀酸液完成了这项无声的壮举……不过我不能过多沉溺于这些英勇回忆，尽管它们散发着豪迈与狡黠交织的魅力。\n\n干我们这行当，如同其他行当一样，命运的反复无常时常需要算计。幸运女神并非总是慷慨。就在我所讲述的这个时期，我和提鲁夫·奥姆帕里奥斯陷入了极端窘迫的财务困境。人们可诅咒地把珠宝藏得严实，门窗加装双重门闩，新型锁具层出不穷，守卫们不是更加警觉就是不再打瞌睡——简而言之，我们这行当的天然困难成倍增加。有段时间我们甚至沦落到偷窃体积庞大却价值低廉的货物，即便如此仍险象环生。至今想起那晚我们差点因一袋红薯被捕的情形，仍令我羞愧难当。\n\n某个傍晚，在乌祖尔达鲁姆贫民区的小巷里，我们清点财产时发现只剩三枚帕祖尔币——刚够买一大瓶石榴酒或两条面包。我们争论着如何花费。\n\n\"面包能滋养身体，\"提鲁夫·奥姆帕里奥斯主张道，\"让我们疲惫的四肢和操劳过度的手指重获活力。\"\n\n\"石榴酒，\"我说，\"能升华思想，启迪心智，或许还能为我们指明摆脱困境的道路。\"\n\n提鲁夫被我说服，我们走进附近酒馆。那酒味道虽非上乘，但分量与烈度恰到好处。当鲜红酒液的火热全部涌入脑海，未来的黑暗道路仿佛被玫瑰色火炬照亮，世界的狰狞面目也奇妙地柔和起来。突然，我灵光乍现。\n\n\"提鲁夫·奥姆帕里奥斯，\"我说，\"我们这等勇士，何必畏惧庸众的迷信？为何不去科摩里奥姆取用那些帝王宝藏？\"\n\n\"说得好，亲爱的朋友，\"提鲁夫回应，\"没理由不从那些死去的国王或神祇那里补充我们干瘪的钱袋。\"\n\n众所周知，科摩里奥姆因极地白女巫的预言而被遗弃数百年——她预言任何滞留该地的凡人都将遭遇难以名状的恐怖厄运。有人说这厄运是经丛林部落传来的北方瘟疫，也有人说是某种疯狂。无论如何，从国王到盗贼，无人敢留在这座北极丰饶山谷中的大理石之城。传说那里未遭洗劫的墓穴仍藏着陪葬的宝石与琥珀金，神庙里金制祭器完好无损，神像眼耳口鼻镶嵌的珍宝依旧闪耀。\n\n若非缺钱买第二瓶石榴酒，我们当晚就会出发。次日黎明，我们踏上北行古道。路上我们用偷来的母鸡和琥珀甜瓜果腹，傍晚时分终于来到那条通往科摩里奥姆的、几乎被丛林吞没的古老石径。\n\n踏入这条路的瞬间，我们就与人间断了联系。自传说中那位国王率众撤离后，这片森林的寂静似乎从未被凡人脚步惊扰。树木庞大得超乎想象，藤蔓如永恒蛛网般缠绕其间。花朵大得不自然，花瓣带着死寂的苍白或血腥的猩红，香气甜腻得令人窒息。果实虽色泽诱人，我们却不敢品尝。\n\n随着深入，丛林愈发狰狞。花岗岩铺就的道路被树根拱裂，尽管日头未落，巨木投下的幽绿暗影已笼罩我们。这里没有寻常森林的鸟兽，只有惨白的毒蛇在路边滑行，或斑纹诡异的巨蛾飞入幽暗。紫红色的蝙蝠用红宝石般的眼睛盯着我们，仿佛空中悬浮着无形的监视者。敬畏与隐约的恐惧使我们噤声，只偶尔低声耳语。\n\n我们带着的棕榈酒此时派上用场。几口烈酒下肚，丛林不再那么可怖。当暮色降临，渐盈的月亮升起时，冒险的热血驱使我们决定星夜兼程赶往科摩里奥姆。\n\n我们没走多远。正当争论着要先拿科摩里奥姆神话宝藏中的哪件珍宝时，月光下出现了大理石穹顶的闪光，接着是柱廊的苍白轮廓。几步之后，我们踏上了通往丛林的铺石街道，巨型蕨类高过古老建筑的屋顶。\n\n周遭寂静如坟。这些白色建筑死寂如墓，笼罩它们的阴影散发着死亡般的寒意。仿佛自白女巫预言引发大迁徙后，再没有比惨白月光更温暖的光线触碰过这些石料。\n\n\"但愿现在是白天。\"提鲁夫低语，声音在死寂中异常清晰。\n\n\"提鲁夫·奥姆帕里奥斯，\"我回应，\"希望你没染上庸人的迷信。\"我们又喝了几口酒，勇气恢复后便开始探索左侧街道。\n\n在尚未被丛林完全侵占的广场上，我们发现了一座比其他建筑更古老的黑色玄武岩小神庙——这是札特瓜的神殿，这位被人类遗忘的古神，据说至今仍有丛林猛兽在祂的灰烬祭坛前膜拜。\n\n神庙保存完好，唯有门楣有些碎裂。覆满铜绿的青铜门微微开启。想到里面可能有镶宝神像和贵重祭器，诱惑难以抗拒。\n\n为推开沉重的铜门，我们痛饮烈酒。锈蚀的铰链发出非人般的尖啸，门内涌出陈年霉味与陌生恶臭。我点燃树脂火炬，踏入神殿。\n\n地面铺着与墙壁相同的五角形石板。除了尽头宝座上的神像、两层淫秽浮雕祭坛，以及殿中央的三足青铜大盆外，殿内空无一物。我们冲向神像，将火把凑近。\n\n札特瓜的形象丑陋得超乎想象：臃肿如蟾蜍的身躯覆盖着仿毛，球状眼睛半闭，肥厚嘴唇间探出怪舌。最令人失望的是，这尊可憎神像竟连最廉价的宝石都没镶嵌。\n\n此时我们才注意到那股不断增强的恶臭来自青铜盆。盆内盛满煤烟色的粘稠液体，表面突然翻涌，一个无定形的头颅从黑液中缓缓升起，鼓胀的双眼带着原始恶意瞪视我们。接着两条似臂非臂的肢体伸出，我们惊恐地发现——这液体本身正在形成这些可憎器官！\n\n前所未有的恐惧攫住我们。黑液如黑色水银般溢出铜盆，在地面化作蛇形，又长出十几条短腿。我们转身逃向殿门，却发现铜门已无声关闭。绝望中，我们最后的记忆是那团蠕动黑液扑来的景象——以及提鲁夫被吞噬时撕心裂肺的惨叫。\n\n当我再次清醒，已躺在乌祖尔达鲁姆的医院。他们说我在丛林边缘被猎户发现，右手自腕部以下消失。至于提鲁夫·奥姆帕里奥斯，再没有人见过他。\n\n何等不可名状的原生质恐怖，何等令人作呕的原始淤泥孽种正朝我们蠕动而来——我们根本无暇思索或揣测。那怪诞之物可怖得令人不敢稍加凝视；更因其意图昭然若揭地充满敌意，且明显流露出食人倾向：它以难以置信的疾速蜿蜒滑行，张开无齿却大得骇人的巨口。当那可怖的嘴朝我们咧开时，一条如长蛇般蠕动的舌头从喉间舒展而出，与它所有动作同样充满诡异弹性的下颚不断扩张。我们意识到必须即刻逃离撒托古亚的神殿，便背向那座亵渎圣所中的种种可憎之物，纵身跃过门槛，在月光下疯狂穿过柯摩里奥姆的城郊。我们绕过每个街角，在湮灭于时光的贵族府邸与无名商贾的货栈间迂回穿梭，专挑那些被丛林巨树侵蚀得最幽深茂密之处奔逃；最终在某条看不见城郊屋舍的僻径上，我们喘息着壮胆回望。\n\n肺叶在剧烈喘息中几欲爆裂，整日的疲惫如铅块般压垮了我们。可当看见那黑色怪物正如山洪泻坡般以蛇行姿态不紧不慢地追随时，衰竭的四肢竟奇迹般重获力量。我们仓皇逃进无路可循的密林，妄图借盘根错节的树藤与巨叶迷宫甩开追猎者。树根与朽木将我们绊倒，野蛮荆棘撕碎衣衫割裂皮肉，黑暗中不断撞上忽而弯曲的巨树与柔韧树苗。头顶枝杈间传来树蛇嘶鸣，毒液从上方溅落；仓皇奔逃时踩中的隐形生物发出咕哝或嚎叫。但我们再不敢停留或回望。\n\n这场亡命奔逃想必持续了数小时。穿透厚重叶隙的月光本就微弱，此刻更在巨蕨棕榈与藤蔓交织处愈沉愈低。当月轮最终隐没时，正是它最后的微光使我们免于陷入恶臭沼泽——我们不得不在那些长满隐蔽草墩的危险泥淖边缘持续奔逃，任凭可憎的追猎者步步紧逼。失去月光后，逃亡变得愈发狂乱凶险：在黏稠如蛛网般纠缠的夜色里，恐惧、力竭与混乱交织成谵妄，我们机械地跨过无数再无力辨明的障碍。那怪物明明随时能以惊人的延展能力追上我们，却似在享受这场猎杀游戏。于是黑夜在无尽延展的恐怖中流逝……而我们始终不敢停步或回首。\n\n当树梢泛起苍白的朦胧晨光时，我们比死者更疲惫地奔向这道微明，踉跄冲出丛林，踏上一条两侧林立着大理石与花岗岩建筑的铺石街道。在压倒性的疲惫中，我们迟钝地意识到自己绕回了柯摩里奥姆城郊。投枪可及的近处，赫然矗立着撒托古亚的黑暗神殿。\n\n再度回首时，那弹性怪物已伸长下肢耸立在我们上方，巨口扩张到足以将我们一口吞噬。它带着令人崩溃的从容滑行而来，精准的动作中透着毛骨悚然的嘲弄。我们冲进仍维持着先前开启状态的神殿，以绝望激发的超人力道猛然合上门扉，竟侥幸将一道锈蚀的门闩推入槽位。\n\n当黎明的惨淡天光从高窗斜射而入时，我们以近乎英勇的听天由命之态静候命运裁决。此刻撒托古亚神像显露出比火炬照耀下更愚钝、更污秽、更兽性的姿态。\n\n我记得曾提及门楣早已碎裂出几处缺口。事实上，这些裂缝已形成三个足够小型动物或巨蛇通过的孔洞。不知为何，我们的目光被这些孔洞牢牢攫住。\n\n未及久视，三道光线突然同时被遮蔽，接着某种黑色物质如溪流般从孔洞涌入，沿门板淌至石板地面重新汇聚，凝成追猎我们的可怖形态。\n\n\"永别了，提洛夫·奥帕里奥斯。\"我挤出肺里最后的气息喊道，随即躲到撒托古亚神像背后——这尊神像唯一可取之处便是其肥硕腰腹提供的遮蔽空间，可惜仅容一人藏身。提洛夫本可抢先实施这个自救妙计，但我更快一步。发现无法共享藏身之处后，他回应了我的告别，爬进那只三足青铜巨碗——在这空荡神殿里，那是仅存的临时庇护所。\n\n我从这尊可憎神像背后窥视怪物的举动。提洛夫刚蜷身入碗，那无名的庞然巨物便如煤烟柱般耸起，向铜碗滑去。此刻它的头部已变形为躯干中央模糊的五官轮廓，没有脖颈四肢。怪物在碗缘悬停片刻，将全部躯体凝聚成锥形尾端，随即如溃堤浪涛般倾泻入碗，整个身躯在沉没时裂成一张吞没提洛夫的巨口。\n\n在惊怖的窒息中，我等待良久，铜碗里却未传出丝毫声响或动静——连提洛夫的呻吟都没有。最终我以无限迟缓的谨慎从神像后挪出，踮脚绕过铜碗向门口移动。\n\n要重获自由必须拉开闩锁开门，但声响令我恐惧至极。我深知打扰正在消化猎物的碗中怪物绝非明智之举，可要逃离这亵渎神殿别无他法。\n\n就在我抽开门闩的刹那，一条触手以地狱般的迅捷从碗中射出，横贯整个房间死死钳住我的右腕。那触感超越所有认知：难以言喻的黏腻湿冷，如沼泽腐泥般令人作呕的柔软，却又带着锋锐金属的蚀骨刺痛。随着钳制收紧，剧痛的吸盘与收缩令我失声尖叫，仿佛被刀刃组成的刑具切入皮肉。挣扎中我拽开了门，向前扑倒在门槛上。一阵撕心裂肺的剧痛后，我发现自己竟挣脱了束缚。但低头只见右手已然消失，仅余渗血不多的枯槁断腕。回望神殿时，我看见那条触手正缩回铜碗边缘，带着我失去的手掌去与提洛夫·奥帕里奥斯的残骸相会。"

        "content": "\n\nWhen morghi, the high priest of the goddess Yhoundeh, together with twelve of his most ferocious and efficient underlings, came at morning twilight to seek the infamous heretic, Eibon, in his house of black gneiss on a headland above the northern main, they were surprised as well as disappointed to find him absent.\n\nTheir surprise was due to the fact that they had every intention of taking him unawares; for all their plots against Eibon had been carried on with meticulous privacy in underground vaults with sound-proof bolted doors; and they themselves had made the long journey to his house in a single night, immediately following the hour of his condemnation. They were disappointed because the formidable writ of arrest, with symbolic flame-etched runes on a scroll of human skin, was now useless and because there seemed to be no early prospect of trying out the ingenious agonies, the intricately harrowing ordeals which they had devised for Eibon with such care.\n\nMorghi was especially disappointed; and the malisons which he muttered when the emptiness of the topmost room had revealed itself, were of truly cabalistic length and fearfulness. Eibon was his chief rival in wizardry, and was acquiring altogether too much fame and prestige among the peoples of Mhu Thulan, that ultimate peninsula of the Hyperborean continent. So Morghi had been glad to believe certain malignant rumors concerning Eibon and to utilize them in the charges he had preferred.\n\nThese rumors were, that Eibon was a devotee of the long discredited heathen god, Zhothaqquah, whose worship was incalculably older than man; and that Eibon's magic was drawn from his unlawful affiliation with this dark deity, who had come down by way of other worlds from a foreign universe, in primeval times when the earth was still no more than a steaming morass. The power of Zhothaqquah was still feared; and it was said that those who were willing to forego their humanity by serving him would become the heritors of antemundane secrets, and the masters of a knowledge so awful that it could only have been brought from outlying planets coeval with night and chaos.\n\nThe house of Eibon was built in the form of a pentagonal tower and possessed five stories, including the two that were underground. All, of course, had been searched with painstaking thoroughness; and the three servants of Eibon had been tortured with a slow drip of boiling-hot asphaltum to make them reveal their master's whereabouts. Their continued denial of all knowledge, after a half hour of this, was taken as proof that they were genuinely ignorant.\n\nNo sign of a subterranean passage was unearthed by delving in the walls and floor of the lower rooms; though Morghi had even gone so far as to remove the flagstones beneath an obscene image of Zhothaqquah which occupied the nethermost. This he had done with extreme reluctance, for the squat, fur-covered god with his bat-like features and sloth-like body, was fearsomely abhorrent to the high priest of the elk-goddess, Yhoundeh.\n\nReturning in renewed search to the highest room of Eibon's tower, the inquisitors were compelled to own themselves baffled. There was nothing to be found but a few articles of furniture, some antique volumes on conjuration such as might be owned by any sorcerer, some disagreeable and gruesome paintings on rolls of pterodactyl parchment, and certain primitive urns and sculptures and totem-poles of the sort that Eibon had been so fond of collecting. Zhothaqquah, in one form or another, was represented in most of these: his face even leered with a bestial somnolence from the urn-handles; and he was to be found in half the totems (which were those of sub-human tribes) along with the seal, the mammoth, the giant tiger, and the aurochs. Morghi felt that the charges against Eibon were now substantiated beyond all remaining doubt, for surely no one who was not a worshipper of Zhothaqquah would care to own even a single representation of this loathsome entity.\n\nHowever, such additional evidence of guilt, no matter how significant or damnatory, was of small help in finding Eibon. Staring from the windows of the topmost chamber, where the walls fell sheer to the cliff and the cliff dropped clear on two sides to a raging sea four hundred feet below, Morghi was driven to credit his rival with superior resources of magic. Otherwise, the man's disappearance was altogether too much of a mystery. And Morghi had no love for mysteries, unless they were part of his own stock-in-trade.\n\nHe turned from the window and re-examined the room with minutely careful attention. Eibon had manifestly used it as a sort of study: there was a writing-table of ivory, with reed-pens, and various colored inks in little earthen pots; and there were sheets of paper made from a kind of calamite, all scribbled over with odd astronomical and astrological calculations that caused Morghi to frown because he could not understand them.\n\nOn each of the five walls there hung one of the parchment paintings, all of which seemed to be the work of some aboriginal race. Their themes were blasphemous and repellent; and Zhothaqquah figured in all of them, amid forms and landscapes whose abnormality and sheer uncouthness may have been due to the half-developed technique of the primitive artists. Morghi now tore them from the walls one by one, as if he suspected that Eibon might in some manner be concealed behind them.\n\nThe walls were now entirely bare; and Morghi considered them for a long time, amid the respectful silence of his underlings. A queer panel, high up in the southeastern side above the writing-table, had been revealed by the removal of one of the paintings. Morghi's heavy brows met in a long black bar as he eyed this panel. It was conspicuously different from the rest of the wall, being an oval-shaped inlay of some reddish metal tbat was neither gold nor copper — a metal that displayed an obscure and fleeting fluorescence of rare colors when one peered at it through half-shut eyelids. But somehow it was impossible, with open eyes, even to remember the colors of this fluorescence. Morghi — who, perhaps, was cleverer and more perspicacious than Eibon had given him credit for being — conceived a suspicion that was apparently baseless and absurd, since the wall containing the panel was the outer wall of the building, and could give only on the sky and sea.\n\nHe climbed upon the writing-table and struck the panel with his fist. The sensations which he felt, and the result of the blow, were alike astounding. A sense of icy cold so extreme that it was hardly distinguishable from extreme heat, ran along his hand and arm through his whole body as he smote the unknown reddish metal. And the panel itself swung easily outward, as if on unseen hinges, with a high sonorous clang that seemed to fall from an incomputable distance. Beyond it, Morghi saw that there was neither sky nor sea nor, in fact, anything he had ever seen or heard of, or even dreamed of in his most outrageous nightmares...\n\nHe turned to his companions. The look on his face was half amazement, half triumph.\n\n\"Wait here till I return,\" he commanded, and leaped headlong through the open panel.\n\nThe charges that had been brought against Eibon were indeed true. The sagacious wizard, in his lifelong study of laws and agencies, both natural and supernatural, had taken account of the myths that were prevalent in Mhu Thulan regarding Zhothaqquah, and had thought it conceivably worth while to make a personal investigation of this obscure pre-human entity.\n\nHe had cultivated the acquaintance of Zhothaqquah, who, in the desuetude of his worship, was now driven to lead an existence wholly subterranean; he had offered the prescribed prayers, had made the sacrifices that were most acceptable; and the strange, sleepy little god, in return for Eibon's interest and his devotion, had confided to him certain information that was more than useful in the practise of the black arts. Also he had presented Eibon with some autobiographical data that confirmed the popular legends in more explicit detail. For reasons which he did not specify, he had come to Earth in former aeons from the planet Cykranosh (the name by which Saturn was called in Mhu Thulan); and Cykranosh itself had been merely a waystation in his travels from remoter worlds and systems.\n\nAs a special reward, after years of service and burnt offerings, he presented to Eibon a large thin oval plate of some ultra-telluric metal, instructing him to have it fitted as a hinged panel in an upper room of his house. The panel, if swung outward from the wall on open air, would have the peculiar property of giving admittance to the world Cykranosh, many million miles away in space.\n\nAccording to the vague and somewhat unsatisfactory explanation vouchsafed by the god, this panel, being partly wrought from a kind of matter which belonged to another universe than man's, possessed uncommon radiative properties that served to ally it with some higher dimension of space, through which the distance to astronomically remote spheres was a mere step.\n\nZhothaqquah, however, warned Eibon not to make use of the panel unless in time of extreme need, as a means of escape from otherwise inevitable danger; for it would be difficult if not impossible to return to Earth from Cykranosh — a world where Eibon might find it anything but easy to acclimate himself, since the conditions of life were very different from those in Mhu Thulan, even though they did not involve so total an inversion of all terrene standards and norms as that which prevailed in the more outlying planets.\n\nSome of Zhothaqquah's relatives were still resident in Cykranosh and were worshipped by its peoples; and Zhothaqquah told Eibon the almost unpronounceable name of the most powerful of these deities, saying that it would be useful to him as a sort of password if he should ever need to visit Cykranosh.\n\nThe idea of a panel that would open on some remote world impressed Eibon as being rather fantastic, not to say far-fetched; but he had found Zhothaqquah to be in all ways and at all times a most veracious deity. However, he made no trial of the panel's unique virtues, till Zhothaqquah (who maintained a close surveillance of all underground doings) had warned him of the machinations of Morghi and the processes of ecclesiastic law that were being instituted in the vaults below the temple of Yhoundeh.\n\nKnowing as he did the power of these jealous bigots, Eibon decided that it would be injudicious to the point of folly if he were to let himself fall into their hands. Bidding a short and grateful farewell to Zhothaqquah, and collecting a small parcel of bread and meat and wine, he retired to his study and climbed upon the writing-table. Then, putting aside the crude picture of a scene in Cykranosh with which Zhothaqquah had inspired some primeval half-human artist, he pushed open the panel it had served to conceal.\n\nEibon saw that Zhothaqquah was indeed a god of his word: for the scene beyond the panel was nothing that could ever find a legitimate place in the topography of Mhu Thulan or of any terrestrial region. It did not altogether appeal to him; but there was no alternative, save the inquisitorial cells of the goddess Yhoundeh. Envisaging in thought the various refinements and complications of torture which Morghi would have now prepared, he sprang through the opening into Cykranosh with an agility that was quite juvenile for a wizard of mature years.\n\nIt was only a step; but turning he saw that all trace of the panel or of his dwelling had now disappeared. He was standing on a long declivity of ashen soil, down which a sluggish stream that was not water, but some liquescent metal resembling mercury, ran from tremendous unscalable shoulders and horns of the mountain heights above, to debouch in a hill-surrounded lake of the same liquid.\n\nThe slope beneath him was lined with rows of peculiar objects; and he could not make up his mind whether they were trees, mineral forms, or animal organisms, since they appeared to combine certain characteristics of all these. This preternatural landscape was appallingly distinct in every detail, under a greenish-black sky that was overarched from end to end with a triple cyclopean ring of dazzling luminosity. The air was cold, and Eibon did not care for its sulphurescent odor or the odd puckery sensation it left in his nostrils and lungs. And when he look a few steps on the unattractive-looking soil, he found that it had the disconcerting friability of ashes that have dried once more after being wetted with rain.\n\nHe started down the slope, half-fearing that some of the equivocal objects around him would reach out their mineral boughs or arms to arrest his progress. They seemed to be a kind of bluish-purple obsidian cacti, with limbs that ended in formidable talon-like spines, and heads that were altogether too elaborate for either fruits or blossoms. They did not move as he passed among them; but he heard a faint and singular tinkling with many modulations of tone, that preceded and followed him along the slope. Eibon conceived the uncomfortable notion that they were holding converse with each other; and were perhaps debating what should be done with him or about him.\n\nHowever, he reached without mishap or hindrance the end of the declivity, where terraces and ledges of decomposing trap, like a mighty stairway of elder aeons, had rimmed the sunken lake of liquescent metal. Wondering as to the way he should now take, Eibon stood irresolute on one of the ledges.\n\nHis train of conjecture was broken by a shadow that fell suddenly athwart him and lay like a monstrous blot on the crumbling stone at his feet. He was not prepossessed by the shadow: it was outrageously defiant of all known esthetic standards; and its malformation and distortion were no less than extravagant.\n\nHe turned to see what manner of creature had flung the shadow. This being, he perceived, was not easy to classify, with its ludicrously short legs, its exceedingly elongated arms, and its round, sleepy-looking head that was pendulous from a spherical body, as if it were turning a somnambulistic somersault. But after he had studied it a while and had noted its furriness and somnolent expression, he began to see a vague though inverted likeness to the god Zhothaqquah. And remembering how Zhothaqquah had said the form assumed by himself on Earth was not altogether that which he had worn in Cykranosh, Eibon now wondered if this entity was one of Zhothaqquah's relatives.\n\nHe was trying to recall the almost inarticulable name that had been confided to him by the god as a sort of password, when the owner of that unusual shadow, without seeming to note Eibon's presence, began a descent of the terraces and ledges toward the lake. Its locomotion was mainly on its hands, for the absurd legs were not half long enough for the steps it had to take.\n\nArriving at the lake-edge, the creature drank of the liquid metal in a hearty and copious manner that served to convince Eibom of its godship; for surely no being of an inferior biologic order would quench its thirst with a beverage so extraordinary. Then, re-ascending to the ledge where Eibon stood, it paused and appeared to notice him for the first time.\n\nEibon had finally remembered the outlandish name for which he was groping.\n\n\"Hziulquoigmnzhah,\" he sought to articulate. Doubtless the result was not wholly conformable to Cykranoshian rules; but Eibon did the best he could with the vocal organs at his command. His auditor seemed to recognize the word, for it peered at Eibon a little less sleepily than before, with its inversely situated eyes; and even deigned to utter something which sounded like an attempt to correct his pronunciation. Eibon wondered how he was ever to learn such a language; or, having learned it, how he was ever to pronounce it. However, it heartened him a little to find that he was understood at all.\n\n\"Zhothaqquah,\" he said, repeating the name three times in his most orotund incantatory manner.\n\nThe topsy-turvy being opened its eyes a trifle more, and again admonished him, uttering the word Zhothaqquah with an indescribable abbreviation of vowels and thickening of consonants. Then it stood regarding him for a while as if in doubt or cogitation. Finally it raised one of its ell-long arms from the ground and pointed along the shore, where the mouth of a low valley was discernible among the hills. It said distinctly the enigmatic words: \"Iqhui dlosh odhqlonqh,\" and then, while the sorcerer was pondering the significance of this unusual locution, it turned away from him and started to re-ascend the higher steps, toward a rather spacious cavern with columned opening, that he had not heretofore perceived. It had hardly passed from sight into the cavern, when Eibon was greeted by the high priest, Morghi, who had readily followed him by his tracks in the ashen soil.\n\n\"Detestable sorcerer! Abominable heretic! I arrest you!\" said Morghi with pontifical severity.\n\nEibon was surprised, not to say startled; but it reassured him to see that Morghi was alone. He drew the sword of highly tempered bronze which he carried, and smiled.\n\n\"I should advise you to moderate your language, Morghi,\" he admonished. \"Also, your idea of arresting me is slightly out of place now, since we are alone together in Cykranosh, and Mhu Thulan and the temple-cells of Yhoundeh are many million miles away.\"\n\nMorghi did not appear to relish this information. He scowled and muttered: \"I suppose this is some more of your damnable wizardry.\"\n\nEibon chose to ignore the insinuation.\n\n\"I have been conversing with one of the gods of Cykranosh,\" he said magniloquently. \"The god, whose name is Hziulquoigmnzhah, has given me a mission to perform, a message to deliver, and has indicated the direction in which I should go. I suggest that you lay aside our little mundane disagreement, and accompany me. Of course we could slit each other's throats or eviscerate each other, since we are both armed. But under the circumstances I think you will see the puerility, not to mention the sheer inutility, of such a proceeding. If we both live we may be of mutual use and assistance, in a strange world whose problems and difficulties, if I mistake not, are worthy of our united powers.\"\n\nMorghi frowned and pondered.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said grudgingly, \"I consent. But I warn you that matters will have to take their course when we return to Mhu Thulan.\"\n\n\"That,\" rejoined Eibon, \"is a contingency which need not trouble either of us. Shall we start?\"\n\nThe two Hyperboreans had been following a defile that wound away from the lake of fluid metal among hills whose vegetation thickened and grew more various as their height decreased. It was the valley that had been indicated to the sorcerer by the topsy-turvy biped. Morghi, a natural inquisitor in all senses, was plying Eibon with questions.\n\n\"Who, or what, was the singular entity that disappeared in a cavern just before I accosted you?\"\n\n\"That was the god Hziulquoigmnzhah.\"\n\n\"And who, pray, is this god? I confess that I have never heard of him.\"\n\n\"He is the paternal uncle of Zhothaqquah.\"\n\nMorghi was silent, except for a queer sound that might have been either an interrupted sneeze or an exclamation of disgust. But after a while he asked:\n\n\"And what is this mission of yours?\"\n\n\"That will be revealed in due time,\" answered Eibon with sententious dignity. \"I am not allowed to discuss it at present. I have a message from the god which I must deliver only to the proper persons.\"\n\nMorghi was unwillingly impressed.\n\n\"Well, I suppose you know what you are doing and where you are going. Can you give me any hint as to our destination?\"\n\n\"That, too, will be revealed in due time.\"\n\nThe hills were lapsing gently to a well-wooded plain whose flora would have been the despair of Earthly botanists. Beyond the last hill, Eibon and Morghi came to a narrow road that began abruptly and stretched away in the distance. Eibon took the road without hesitation. Indeed there was little else to do, for the thickets of mineral plants and trees were rapidly becoming impenetrable. They lined the way with serrate branches that were like sheaves of darts and daggers, of sword-blades and needles.\n\nEibon and Morghi soon noticed that the road was full of large footprints, all of them circular in form and rimmed about with the marks of protruding claws. However, they did not communicate their misgivings to each other.\n\nAfter an hour or two of progress along the yielding ashy thoroughfare, amid the vegetation that was more horrent than ever with knives and caltrops, the travelers began to remember that they were hungry. Morghi, in his haste to arrest Eibon, had not breakfasted; and Eibon, in his natural hurry to evade Morghi, had committed a like omission. They halted by the wayside, and the sorcerer shared his parcel of food and wine with the priest. They ate and drank with frugality, however, since the supply was limited, and the landscape about them was not likely to yield any viands that were suitable for human sustenance.\n\nWith strength and courage revived by this little refection, they continued their journey, They had not gone far when they overtook a remarkable monster that was plainly the originator of the numerous footprints. It was squatting down with its armored haunches toward the travelers, filling the whole road for an indeterminable distance ahead. They could see that it was possessed of a myriad of short legs; but they could form no idea of what its head and forequarters were like.\n\nEibon and Morghi were much dismayed.\n\n\"Is this another of your 'gods'?\" asked Morghi ironically.\n\nThe sorcerer did not reply. But he realized that he had a reputation to sustain. He went boldly forward and cried out: \"Hziulquoigmnzhah\" in the most resonant bellow that he could summon. At the same time he drew his sword and thrust it between two plates of the horny mail that covered the monster's hindquarters.\n\nGreatly to his relief, the animal began to move and resumed its march along the road. The Hyperboreans followed it; and whenever the creature slackened its pace Eibon would repeat the formula which he had found so effective. Morghi was compelled to regard him with a certain awe.\n\nThey traveled on in this manner for several hours. The great luminous triple ring still over-arched the zenith, but a strangely small and chilly sun had now intersected the ring and was declining toward the west of Cykranosh. The forest along the way was still a high wall of sharp metallic foliage; but other roads and paths and byways were now branching off from the one that the monster followed.\n\nAll was very silent, except for the many-footed shuffling of this uncouth animal; and neither Eibon nor Morghi had spoken for miles. The high priest was regretting more and more his rashness in pursuing Eibon through the panel; and Eibon was wishing that Zhothaqquah had given him the entrée to a different sort of world. They were startled out of their meditations by a sudden clamor of deep and booming voices that rose from somewhere in advance of the monster. It was a veritable pandemoniun of unhuman guttural bellowings and croakings, with notes that were somehow suggestive of reproof and objurgation, like shrewish drums, as if the monster were being scolded by a group of unimaginable entities.\n\n\"Well?\" queried Morghi.\n\n\"All that we are destined to behold will reveal itself at the proper time,\" said Eibon.\n\nThe forest was thinning rapidly, and the clamor of termagant bellows was drawing closer. Still following the hindquarters of their multipedal guide, which was crawling on with reluctant slowness, the travelers emerged in an open space and beheld a most singular tableau. The monster, which was plainly of a tame and harmless and stupid sort, was cowering before a knot of beings no larger than men, who were armed only with long-handled goads.\n\nThese beings, though they were bipeds, and were not quite so unheard-of in their anatomic structure as the entity which Eibon had met by the lake, were nevertheless sufficiently unusual; for their head and bodies were apparently combined in one, and their ears, eyes, nostrils, mouths, and certain other organs of doubtful use were all arranged in a somewhat unconventional grouping on their chests and abdomens. They were wholly naked, and were rather dark in color, with no trace of hair on any part of their bodies. Behind them at a little distance were many edifices of a kind which hardly conformed to human ideas of architectural symmetry.\n\nEibon strode valorously forward, with Morghi following discreetly. The torso-headed beings ceased their scolding of the fawning monster and peered at the Earth-men with expressions that were difficult to read on account of the odd and baffling relationship of their features.\n\n\"Hziulquoigmnzhah! Zhothaqquah!\" said Eibon with oracular solemnity and sonority. Then, after a pause of hieratic length: \"Iqhui dlosh odhqlonqh!\"\n\nThe result was indeed gratifying, and was all that could be expected even from a formula so remarkable; for the Cykranoshian beings dropped their goads and bowed before the sorcerer till their featured bosoms almost touched the ground.\n\n\"I have performed the mission, I have delivered the message given me by Hziulquoigmnzhah,\" said Eibon to Morghi.\n\nFor several Cykranoshian months the two Hyperboreans were the honored guests of the quaint and worthy and virtuous people, who called themselves the Bhlemphroims. Eibon had a real gift for languages and made progress in the local tongue far more readily than Morghi. His knowledge of the customs, manners, ideas, and beliefs of the Bhlemphroims soon became extensive; but he found it a source of disillusionment as well as of illumination.\n\nThe armored monster that he and Morghi had driven before them so valiantly was, he learned, a domestic beast of burden that had strayed away from its owners amid the mineral vegetation of the desert lands adjoining Vhlorrh, the chief town of the Bhlemphroims. The genuflections with which Eibon and Morghi had been greeted were only an expression of gratitude for the safe return of this beast; and were not, as Eibon had thought, an acknowledgment of the divine names he had quoted and the fearsome phrase, \"Iqhui dlosh odhqlonqh.\"\n\nThe being that Eibon had met by the lake was indeed the god Hziulquoigmnzhah; and there were dim traditions of Zhothaqquah in certain early myths of the Bhlemphroims. But this people, it seemed, were most regrettably materialistic and had long ceased to offer sacrifice and prayer to the gods; though they spoke of them with a sort of distant respect and with no actual blasphemy.\n\nEibon learned that the words \"Iqhui dlosh odhqlonqh\" doubtless belonged to a private language of the gods, which the Bhlemphroims no longer understood; but which, however, was still studied by a neighboring people, the Ydheems, who maintained the ancient formal worship of Hziulquoigmnzhah and various related deities.\n\nThe Bhlemphroims were indeed a practical race, and had few if any interests beyond the cultivation of a great variety of edible fungi, the breeding of large centipedal animals, and the propagation of their own species. The latter process, as revealed to Eibon and Morghi, was somewhat unusual: though the Bhlemphroims were bisexual, only one female in a generation was chosen for reproductive duties; and this female, after growing to mammoth size on food prepared from a special fungus, became the mother of an entire new generation.\n\nWhen they had been well initiated into the life and customs of Vhlorrh, the Hyperboreans were privileged to see the future national mother, called the Djhenquomh, who had now attained the requisite proportions after years of scientific nourishment. She lived in an edifice that was necessarily larger than any of the other buildings in Vhlorrh; and her sole activity was the consumption of immense quantities of food. The sorcerer and the inquisitor were impressed, even if not captivated, by the mountainous amplitude of her charms and by their highly novel arrangement. They were told that the male parent (or parents) of the forthcoming generation had not yet been selected.\n\nThe possession of separate heads by the Hyperboreans seemed to lend them a remarkable biologic interest in the eyes of their hosts. The Bhlemphroims, it was learned, had not always been headless but had reached their present physical conformation through a slow process of evolution, in which the head of the archetypal Bhlemphroim had been merged by imperceptible degrees with the torso.\n\nBut, unlike most peoples, they did not regard their current stage of development with unqualified complacency. Indeed, their headlessness was a source of national regret; they deplored the retrenchment of nature in this regard; and the arrival of Eibon and Morghi, who were looked upon as ideal exemplars of cephalic evolution, had served to quicken their eugenic sorrow.\n\nThe sorcerer and the inquisitor, on their part, found life rather dull among the Bhlemphroims after the first feeling of exoticism had worn off. The diet was tiresome for one thing — an endless succession of raw and boiled and roasted mushrooms, varied at rare intervals by the coarse and flabby meat of tame monsters. And this people, though they were always polite and respectful, did not seem to be greatly awed by the exhibitions of Hyperborean magic with which Eibon and Morghi favored them; and their lamentable want of religious ardor made all evangelistic endeavor a thankless task. And, being fundamentally unimaginative, they were not even duly impressed by the fact that their visitors had come from a remote ultra-Cykranoshian world.\n\n\"I feel,\" said Eibon to Morghi one day, \"that the god was sadly mistaken in deigning to send this people a message of any sort.\"\n\nIt was very soon after this that a large committee of the Blemphroims waited upon Eibon and Morghi and informed them that after long consideration they had been selected as the fathers of the next generation and were to be married forthwith to the tribal mother in the hope that a well-headed race of Bhlemphroims would result from the union.\n\nEibon and Morghi were quite overcome by the proposed eugenic honor. Thinking of the mountainous female they had seen, Morghi was prone to remernber his sacerdotal vows of celibacy and Eibon was eager to take similar vows upon himself without delay. The inquisitor, indeed, was so overwhelmed as to be rendered almost speechless; but, with rare presence of mind, the sorcerer temporized by making a few queries anent the legal and social status which would be enjoyed by Morghi and himself as the husbands of the Djhenquomh. And the naive Blemphroims told him that this would be a matter of brief concern; that after completing their marital duties the husbands were always served to the national mother in the form of ragouts and other culinary preparations.\n\nThe Hyperboreans tried to conceal from their hosts the reluctance with which they both regarded the coming honor in all its stages. Being as usual a master of diplomatics, Eibon went so far as to make a formal acceptance on behalf of himself and his companion. But when the delegation of Bhlemphroims had departed he said to Morghi:\n\n\"I am more than ever convinced that the god was mistaken. We must leave the city of Vhlorrh with all feasible dispatch, and continue our journey till we find a people who are worthier to receive his communication.\"\n\nApparently it had never occurred to the simple and patriotic Bhlemphroims that the fathering of the next national litter was a privilege that anyone would dream of rejecting. Eibon and Morghi were subjected to no manner of duress or constraint, and their movements were not even watched. It was an easy matter to leave the house in which they had been domiciled, when the rumbling snores of their hosts were ascending to the great ring of Cykranoshian moons, and to follow the highway that led from Vhlorrh toward the country of Ydheems.\n\nThe road before them was well marked; and the ringlight was almost as clear and brilliant as full day. They traveled a long distance through the diversified and always unique scenery which it served to illumine, before the rising of the sun and the consequent discovery of their departure by the Bhlemphroims. These single-minded bipeds, it is likely, were too sorely perplexed and dumbfounded by the loss of the guests whom they had chosen as future progenitors to even think of following them.\n\nThe land of the Ydheems (as indicated on an earlier occasion by the Bhlemphroims) was many leagues away; and tracts of ashen deserts, of mineral cacti, of fungoid forests, and high mountains intervened. The boundary of the Bhlemphroims — marked by a crude sculpturesque representation of the tribal mother beside the way — was passed by the travelers before dawn.\n\nAnd during the following day they journeyed among more than one of those unusual races who diversify so widely the population of Saturn. They saw the Djhibbis, that apterous and Stylitean bird-people who roost on their individual dolomites for years at a time and meditate upon the cosmos, uttering to each other at long intervals the mystic syllables yop, yeep, and yoop, which are said to express an unfathomed range of esoteric thought.\n\nAnd they met those flibbertigibbet pygmies, the Ephiqhs, who hollow out their homes in the trunks of certain large fungi, and are always having to hunt new habitations because the old ones crumble into powder in a few days. And they heard the underground croaking of that mysterious people, the Ghlonghs, who dread not only the sunlight but also the ring-light, and who have never yet been seen by any of the surface-dwellers.\n\nBy sunset, however, Eibon and Morghi had crossed the domains of all the aforementioned races, and had even climbed the lower scarps of those mountains which still divided them from the land of Ydheems. Here, on a sheltered ledge, their weariness impelled them to halt; and since they had now ceased to dread pursuit from the Blemphroims, they wrapped themselves more tightly in their mantles against the cold, after a meager supper of raw mushrooms, and fell asleep.\n\nTheir slumber was disturbed by a series of cacodemoniacal dreams in which they both thought they had been recaptured by the Bhlemphroims and were forced to espouse the Djhenquomh. They awoke shortly before dawn from visions whose details were excruciatingly vivid, and were more than ready to resume their ascent of the mountains.\n\nThe slopes and cliffs above them were desolate enough to have deterred any travelers of inferior hardihood or less cogent fears. The tall woods of fungi dwindled ere long to tiny growths, and soon they lessened to forms that were no bigger than lichens; and after these, there was nothing but black and naked stone. The wiry and slender Eibon suffered no great inconvenience from the climb; but Morghi, with his sacerdotal girth and bulk, was soon winded. Whenever he paused to recover his breath, Eibon would say to him: \"Think of the national mother,\" and Morghi would climb the next acclivity like an agile but somewhat asthmatic mountain-sheep.\n\nThey came at noon to a pinnacle-guarded pass from which they could look down on the country of the Ydheems. They saw that it was a broad and fertile realm, with woods of mammoth mushrooms and other thallophytes that excelled in size and number those of any other region they had yet traversed. Even the mountain-slopes were more fruitful on this side, for Eibon and Morghi had not descended far when they entered a grove of enormous puff-balls and toadstools.\n\nThey were admiring the magnitude and variety of these growths, when they heard a thunderous noise on the mountains above them. The noise drew nearer, gathering to itself the roar of new thunders. Eibon would have prayed to Zhothaqquah, and Morghi would have supplicated the goddess Yhoundeh, but unfortunately there was no time. They were caught in a mighty mass of rolling puff-balls and toppling toadstools overthrown by the huge avalanche that had started on the heights above; and, borne with increasing momentum, with vertiginous speed and tumult amid an ever-growing heap of shattered fungi, they finished their descent of the mountain in less than a minute.\n\nEndeavoring to extricate themselves from the pile of thallophytic debris in which they were buried, Eibon and Morghi noticed that there still seemed to be a good deal of noise, even though the avalanche had stopped. Also, there were other movements and heavings than their own in the pile. When they had managed to get their necks and shoulders clear, they discovered that the commotion was being made by certain people who differed from their late hosts, the Bhlemphroims, in that they possessed rudimentary heads.\n\nThese people were some of the Ydheems, on one of whose towns the avalanche had descended. Roofs and towers were beginning to emerge from the mass of boulders and puff-balls; and just in front of the Hyperboreans there was a large temple-like edifice from whose blocked-up door a multitude of the Ydheems had now tunneled their way. At sight of Eibon and Morghi they suspended their labors; and the sorcerer, who had freed himself and had made sure that all his bones and members were intact, now took the opportunity to address them.\n\n\"Harken!\" he said with great importance. \"I have come to bring you a message from the god Hziulquoigmnzhah. I have borne it faithfully on ways beset with many hazards and perils. In the god's own divine language, it runs thus: 'lqhui dlosh odhqfonqh.'\"\n\nSince he spoke in the dialect of the Bhlemphroims, which differed somewhat from their own, it is doubtful if the Ydheems altogether understood the first part of his utterance. But Hziulquoigmnzhah was their tutelary deity, and they knew the language of the gods. At the words: \"Iqhui dlosh odhqlonqh,\" there was a most remarkable resumption and increase of activity, a ceaseless running to and fro on the part of the Ydheems, a shouting of guttural orders, and a recrudescence of new heads and limbs from the avalanche.\n\nThose who had issued from the temple re-entered it, and came out once more carrying a huge image of Hziulquoigmnzhah, some smaller icons of lesser though allied deities, and a very ancient-looking idol which both Eibon and Morghi recognized as having a resemblance to Zhothaqquah. Others of the Ydheems brought their household goods and furniture forth from the dwellings, and, signing the Hyperboreans to accompany them, the whole populace began to evacuate the town.\n\nEibon and Morghi were much mystified. And it was not until a new town had been built on the fungus-wooded plain at the distance of a full day's march, and they themselves had been installed among the priests of the new temple, that they learned the reason of it all and the meaning of: \"Iqhui dlosh odhqlonqh.\" These words meant merely: \"Be on your way,\" and the god had addressed them to Eibon as a dismissal. But the coincidental coming of the avalanche and of Eibon and Morghi with this purported message from the god, had been taken by the Ydheems as a divine injunction to remove themselves and their goods from their present location. Thus the wholesale exodus of people with their idols and domestic belongings.\n\nThe new town was called Ghlomph, after the one that the avalanche had buried. Here, for the remainder of their days, Eibon and Morghi were held in much honor; and their coming with the message, \"Iqhui dlosh odhqlonqh,\" was deemed a fortunate thing, since there were no more avalanches to threaten the security of Ghlomph in its new situation remote from the mountains.\n\nThe Hyperboreans shared the increment of civic affluence and well-being resultant from this security. There was no national mother among the Ydheems, who propagated themselves in a far more general manner than the Bhlemphroims, so existence was quite safe and tranquil. Eibon, at least, was really in his element; for the news which he brought of Zhothaqquah, who was still worshipped in this region of Cykranosh, had enabled him to set up as a sort of minor prophet, even apart from the renown which he enjoyed as the bearer of the divine message and as the founder of the new town of Ghlomph.\n\nMorghi, however, was not entirely happy. Though the Ydheems were religious, they did not carry their devotional fervor to the point of bigotry or intolerance; so it was quite impossible to start an inquisition among them. But still there were compensations: the fungus-wine of the Ydheems was potent though evil-tasting; and there were females of a sort, if one were not too squeamish. Consequently, Morghi and Eibon both settled down to an ecclesiastic regimen which, after all, was not so radically different from that of Mhu Thulan or any other place on the planet of their birth.\n\nSuch were the various adventures, and such was the final lot of this redoubtable pair in Cykranosh. But in Eibon's tower of black gneiss on that headland of the northern sea in Mhu Thulan, the underlings of Morghi waited for days, neither wishing to follow the high priest through the magic panel nor daring to leave in disobedience of his orders.\n\nAt length they were recalled by a special dispensation from the hierophant who had been chosen as Morghi's temporary successor. But the result of the whole affair was highly regrettable from the standpoint of the hierarchy of Yhoundeh. It was universally believed that Eibon had not only escaped by virtue of the powerful magic he had learned from Zhothaqquah but had made away with Morghi into the bargain. As a consequence of this belief, the faith of Yhoundeh declined, and there was a widespread revival of the dark worship of Zhothaqquah throughout Mhu Thulan in the last century before the onset of the great Ice Age.",

"当女神尤恩德的大祭司莫吉带着十二名最凶悍得力的手下，在晨光熹微时分来到北海岬角那座黑色片麻岩宅邸，搜捕恶名昭著的异端者艾本时，他们既惊且怒地发现此人已不知所踪。\n\n令他们震惊的是，此次突袭本应万无一失——针对艾本的密谋始终在隔音地窖中进行，判决甫一下达他们便连夜奔袭而来。而愤怒则源于那张精心炮制的逮捕令：用人皮卷轴镌刻火焰符文的威严文书此刻已成废纸，那些为艾本量身定制的精妙刑具与残酷折磨亦将无用武之地。\n\n莫吉的怨毒尤为深重。当顶层房间空荡的景象映入眼帘时，他口中迸出的诅咒绵长可怖得近乎邪典咒文。作为巫术领域的主要对手，艾本在终北大陆最北端姆·图兰半岛民众间的声望已令他如芒在背。因此当关于艾本的流言传来时，莫吉欣然将其纳入了指控。\n\n传言称艾本信奉早已被唾弃的异教神祇佐斯-奥莫格——其崇拜史远比人类文明更为古老。据说艾本的魔法正源于与这位黑暗之神的亵渎盟约。这位从外星降临的古老存在，在地球尚是蒸汽沼泽的原始纪元，便已穿越诸界而来。佐斯-奥莫格的威能至今令人战栗，传言侍奉祂而舍弃人性者，将继承创世之前的禁忌知识，掌握那些唯有源自混沌外域的可怖智慧。\n\n艾本的居所是座五层五角塔楼，包含两层地窖。莫吉等人掘地三尺仍一无所获，他们用滚烫沥青缓慢滴灼艾本三名仆役，却始终未能撬出主人下落——半小时后，他们不得不承认这些仆役确实毫不知情。\n\n尽管莫吉强忍厌恶掀开了底层佐斯-奥莫格神像下的石板——那覆满毛发的蹲伏神像生着蝙蝠面孔与树懒躯体，令这位麋鹿女神的祭司作呕——但墙壁与地板的搜查仍未发现任何密道痕迹。\n\n重返顶层的审判者们不得不承认失败。房间里只有寻常巫师的标配：几件家具、咒术古籍、翼手龙皮卷轴上的骇人画作，以及艾本热衷收藏的原始瓮罐、雕塑与图腾柱。其中大半都以不同形式呈现着佐斯-奥莫格的形象——从瓮柄上兽性昏睡的狞笑，到半人种族图腾中与海豹、猛犸、巨虎并列的形态。莫吉确信这些足以坐实对艾本的指控，毕竟若非信徒，谁会收藏如此多令人作呕的神像？\n\n但即便罪证确凿，他们仍找不到艾本踪影。莫吉从四百英尺高的临海窗台俯视峭壁下怒涛拍岸的景象，不得不承认对手的魔法造诣更胜一筹。他转身再次审视这个显然被用作书房的房间：象牙书桌、芦杆笔、彩墨陶罐，以及写满晦涩星象计算的蕨类纸页——那些令莫吉皱眉的算式。\n\n五面墙上各挂一幅翼手龙皮画卷，尽显某个原始部落的手笔。亵渎可怖的主题中，佐斯-奥莫格始终居于畸形景观中央，其怪诞程度或许源于创作者拙劣的技法。莫吉逐一撕下画作，仿佛怀疑艾本会藏身其后。\n\n当最后一张画被扯下，东南墙上书桌上方露出一块奇特的椭圆形镶板。这块非金非铜的暗红金属板在眯眼注视时会闪现难以名状的磷光，睁眼时却又转瞬即忘。尽管这面外墙理论上只应朝向天空与大海，莫吉——这位或许比艾本预估的更敏锐的祭司——仍产生了看似荒谬的怀疑。\n\n他爬上书桌挥拳击打镶板。霎时间刺骨寒意如灼热般席卷全身，而镶板竟伴着自虚空降下的清越鸣响向外旋开。展现在莫吉眼前的，既非天空亦非海洋，而是超越人类认知极限的异界图景...\n\n他转向随从，脸上交织着惊愕与狂喜：\"在此候命。\"说罢便纵身跃入镶板之后的虚空。\n\n对艾本的指控确非空穴来风。这位睿智的巫师终其一生探究自然与超自然法则，对姆·图兰流传的佐斯-奥莫格神话进行了实地考证。在信仰凋零的岁月里，他成功与蛰居地下的古神建立了联系。通过规范仪式与献祭，这位昏昏欲睡的异星神祇向他揭示了黑巫术的奥秘，并证实了某些传说细节。\n\n作为多年供奉的奖赏，佐斯-奥莫格赐予艾本一块异界金属薄板，指示其安装在塔楼高层。这块向外开启的镶板将成为通往土星（姆·图兰人称为赛克拉诺什）的通道。古神解释称，这块蕴含异界物质的镶板能联通更高维度，使天文距离缩为一步之遥。但祂警告艾本除非万不得已切勿使用，因从赛克拉诺什返回几乎不可能——那里的生存环境虽比外域行星更接近地球，仍与姆·图兰迥异。\n\n当佐斯-奥莫格（这位始终监视地下动向的古神）预警莫吉的阴谋后，艾本深知落入宗教审判者手中的后果。他简短告别古神，携少量食水来到书房，推开那幅描绘赛克拉诺什景色的原始画作，露出其后暗红的金属镶板。\n\n展现在眼前的异界景观证实了古神的承诺。尽管景象令人不安，但比起尤恩德女神地牢里的刑具，这已是最好选择。想到莫吉精心设计的酷刑，这位年迈巫师以出人意料的敏捷跃入了镶板。\n\n仅仅一步之遥，身后的居所已消失无踪。艾本站在灰烬般的斜坡上，目睹着水银似的液态金属溪流从不可攀援的嶙峋山巅注入环山湖泊。斜坡两侧排列着蓝紫色黑曜石仙人掌般的生物，其矿物枝干末端生着利爪般的尖刺，过分精致的顶端既非果实也非花朵。当他经过时，这些生物虽未移动，却发出音调变幻的奇异叮铃声，令艾本怀疑它们正商议如何处置自己。\n\n来到由古老玄武岩构成的湖岸阶地时，一道突然笼罩他的阴影打断了思绪。这违背所有美学准则的畸形暗影令他悚然转身，看见一个短腿长臂的古怪生物——球状身躯上悬垂着昏昏欲睡的圆脑袋，仿佛梦游者正在翻跟斗。那身皮毛与倦容让艾本联想到倒置版的佐斯-奥莫格。正当他努力回忆古神告知的那拗口名字时，这个似乎未注意到他的生物已用手代步（因短腿实在不够长），朝着金属湖泊笨拙前进。\n\n那生物来到金属湖畔，以豪迈酣畅的姿态痛饮液态金属，这般行径使艾本确信了它的神性——毕竟凡俗生灵岂会以如此非凡的琼浆解渴？待它重新攀上艾本伫立的岩架时，突然驻足，倒置的双眸似乎初次注意到他的存在。\n\n艾本终于忆起那个盘桓在唇齿间的异域名讳。\n\n\"赫祖尔奎格姆恩扎赫。\"他竭力模仿着发音。这声调显然不符合塞克拉诺什的语法规则，但艾本已竭尽人类发声器官之所能。那位聆听者似乎辨出了这个词，它倒生的眼眸稍稍褪去睡意，甚至纡尊降贵地发出某种声响，仿佛在纠正他的发音。艾本暗自思忖要如何习得这般语言，即便学会又该如何准确发声。不过能被理解已使他稍感宽慰。\n\n\"佐萨夸。\"他以最庄重的咒语腔调将这个名字重复了三遍。\n\n那颠倒的生物微微睁大眼眸，再度发出训诫般的声音。当它念出\"佐萨夸\"时，元音诡异地紧缩，辅音黏稠得难以形容。随后它长久凝视着巫师，仿佛陷入犹疑或沉思。最终它从地面抬起足有半丈长的手臂，指向群山间隐约可见的幽谷入口，清晰吐出谜般的词句：\"伊奎·德洛什·奥德克朗克。\"不待艾本参透这古怪箴言的含义，它便转身迈向更高处的石阶，消失在立柱环绕的洞窟中——那处所在艾本先前竟未曾察觉。\n\n几乎就在神影没入洞窟的同时，大祭司莫吉从灰烬土壤上的足迹追踪而至。\"可憎的巫师！亵神的异端！我逮捕你！\"莫吉以审判官式的严厉宣告。\n\n艾本虽惊不乱，见对方孤身前来反倒安心。他抽出淬炼过的青铜剑，嘴角泛起冷笑。\n\n\"建议您斟酌言辞，莫吉大人。\"他慢条斯理地警告，\"至于逮捕的念头更是荒谬。此刻塞克拉诺什荒原上唯有你我二人，伊姆·苏兰的神殿地牢远在百万里之外。\"\n\n莫吉面色阴鸷地低吼：\"想必又是你那些邪恶巫术的把戏。\"\n\n艾本无视这番指控，昂然宣称：\"我刚与塞克拉诺什的某位神祇交谈。赫祖尔奎格姆恩扎赫大神赋予我神圣使命，并指明了前行方向。建议您暂且搁置世俗纷争与我同行。当然——\"他轻弹剑锋，\"我们大可以割开彼此喉咙，不过在这种境况下，这种举动除了幼稚可笑，更是毫无意义。\"\n\n莫吉蹙眉沉思良久，终于不情愿地妥协：\"姑且如此。但回到伊姆·苏兰后......\"\n\n\"届时自有分晓。\"艾本打断道，\"现在启程如何？\"\n\n两位极北之民沿着液态金属湖延伸的峡谷行进，随着山势渐缓，矿质植被愈发繁茂诡谲。这正是颠倒者指引的幽谷。天性多疑的莫吉不断盘问：\"那个遁入洞窟的古怪存在究竟是何物？\"\n\n\"正是赫祖尔奎格姆恩扎赫大神。\"\n\n\"这位神明有何来历？我从未听闻。\"\n\n\"祂是佐萨夸的叔父。\"\n\n莫吉发出介于喷嚏与作呕之间的怪声，半晌又追问：\"你说的使命究竟是什么？\"\n\n\"时机未到。\"艾本高深莫测地回答，\"神谕只能传达给特定之人。\"\n\n这番说辞竟令审判官莫名敬畏。当他们翻过最后一道山脊时，锯齿状的矿质丛林间突然显现出一条小径，路面布满圆形足迹，边缘还残留着利爪凸起的压痕。两人默契地保持沉默，继续前行。\n\n在刀丛剑林般的植被间跋涉数小时后，饥渴开始折磨两位旅人。莫吉为追捕未曾进食，艾本逃亡时同样空腹。他们分食了巫师携带的干粮与酒囊，却不敢尽兴——在这矿物主宰的荒原上，人类可食之物实在稀罕。\n\n补充体力后继续赶路，很快便追上了足迹的制造者：一头甲壳嶙峋的怪物正蹲伏在道路中央，无数短肢在躯干下蠕动，前方道路完全被它装甲般的后躯堵塞。至于首级形貌——两人宁愿永远无从知晓。\n\n\"这又是你的哪位'神明'？\"莫吉讥讽地问道。\n\n巫师没有作答。但他意识到必须维护自己的声望。他壮着胆子向前走去，用最洪亮的嗓音喊道：\"赫祖尔奎格姆恩扎！\"同时抽出佩剑，刺入那头覆盖着角质鳞甲的怪物后腿鳞片间的缝隙。\n\n令他大为宽慰的是，这头巨兽开始移动，重新沿着道路前行。极北之民跟随着它；每当这生物放缓脚步，艾本就会重复那句已被证明卓有成效的咒语。莫吉不得不对他投以敬畏的目光。\n\n他们以这种方式行进了数小时。那三重发光巨环仍高悬天顶，但一轮诡异而冰冷的微小太阳已穿过光环，向着塞克拉诺什的西边沉落。路旁的森林仍是尖锐金属叶片构成的高墙；但此刻已有其他小径从怪物行进的主路分岔而出。\n\n四下万籁俱寂，唯有这畸形生物的多足拖行声；艾本与莫吉已数里未发一言。大祭司越来越后悔自己贸然穿过画板追赶艾本；而艾本则暗自希望若塔库阿能为他开启通往另一类世界的大门。一阵深沉轰鸣的喧哗突然从怪物前方某处响起，打断了他们的沉思。那是非人生物喉音咆哮与嘶鸣交织的真正魔音，其中某些音调莫名带着斥责与咒骂的意味，如同泼妇击鼓，仿佛这怪物正遭受一群不可名状存在的责骂。\n\n\"如何？\"莫吉询问道。\n\n\"我们注定目睹的一切，自会在恰当时刻显现。\"艾本回答。\n\n森林正急速变得稀疏，那些泼妇般的吼叫也越来越近。两位旅人仍跟随着他们多足向导迟缓爬行的后躯，最终来到一片空地，目睹了最离奇的场景。这头显然温顺无害又愚蠢的怪物，此刻正畏缩在一群人类体型大小的生物面前——那些生物仅手持长柄刺棒。\n\n这些双足生物虽然不及艾本在湖畔遭遇的存在那般匪夷所思，却仍足够怪异：它们的头颅与躯干显然合为一体，耳朵、眼睛、鼻孔、嘴巴以及其他用途存疑的器官，都以非常规方式排列在胸腹部位。它们全身赤裸，肤色深暗，体表没有任何毛发痕迹。后方不远处矗立着诸多建筑，其样式完全不符合人类对建筑对称性的认知。\n\n艾本英勇地大步向前，莫吉谨慎地跟在后面。那些胸腹长脸的生物停止了对谄媚怪物的斥责，用难以解读的表情打量着地球来客——它们五官的诡异排布令人困惑。\n\n\"赫祖尔奎格姆恩扎！若塔库阿！\"艾本以神谕般的庄重与洪亮宣告。在祭司般漫长的停顿后，他又道：\"伊奎·德洛什·奥德赫隆克！\"\n\n效果确实令人欣慰，甚至远超对这非凡咒语的所有预期：塞克拉诺什的生物们纷纷丢下刺棒，向巫师鞠躬至胸腹几乎触地。\n\n\"我已履行使命，传达了赫祖尔奎格姆恩扎授予我的讯息。\"艾本对莫吉说道。\n\n在塞克拉诺什历法的数月里，两位极北之民成为这群自称布勒姆弗洛姆人的古怪而可敬族群的座上宾。艾本确有语言天赋，掌握当地语言的速度远胜莫吉。他很快深入了解了布勒姆弗洛姆人的风俗、礼仪、思想与信仰，但这些知识既带来启迪，也带来幻灭。\n\n他得知，当初他与莫吉英勇驱赶的那头披甲怪物，不过是布勒姆弗洛姆主城弗洛尔周边矿质植被区走失的家畜。艾本和莫吉受到的跪拜礼，只是对其安全归还的感激，而非如艾本所想是对他所诵神名与恐怖短语\"伊奎·德洛什·奥德赫隆克\"的认可。\n\n艾本在湖畔遭遇的存在确是神明赫祖尔奎格姆恩扎；而布勒姆弗洛姆某些远古神话中也有关于若塔库阿的模糊传说。但可悲的是，这个种族已彻底物质主义化，早停止了对神明的祭祀与祈祷——尽管他们谈及神明时仍带着疏远的敬意，并无实质亵渎。\n\n艾本了解到\"伊奎·德洛什·奥德赫隆克\"很可能属于某种神祇私语，布勒姆弗洛姆人已无法理解，但邻近的伊迪姆人仍在研习——他们仍保持着对赫祖尔奎格姆恩扎及相关神系的古老祭祀。\n\n布勒姆弗洛姆人确是务实的种族，除培育各类食用真菌、饲养巨型蜈蚣状生物与繁衍后代外几无他求。而他们的繁殖方式尤为特殊：虽属两性生物，但每代仅选一名雌性承担生育职责；这位雌性通过特制真菌食物催胀至庞然体型后，将成为整代新生命的母体。\n\n当极北之客深入了解弗洛尔城的习俗后，获准觐见了被称为\"坚库姆\"的未来国民之母——经过数年科学喂养，她已达成所需体型。她居住的建筑物必然是全城最大，日常活动仅是吞噬海量食物。巫师与审判官虽未着迷，却仍为其山岳般的体量与新奇器官排布所震撼。他们得知新一代的父系尚未选定。\n\n在宿主眼中，极北之民分立的头颅赋予了他们非凡的生物学意义。布勒姆弗洛姆人并非天生无首，而是通过缓慢进化使原始头部逐渐与躯干融合。但与其他种族不同，他们对当前进化阶段并不满意。无首现状实为民族遗憾，他们痛惜自然在此方面的退行。而艾本与莫吉的到来——被视为头颅进化的典范——更深化了他们的优生学忧虑。\n\n对巫师与审判官而言，异域感消退后，布勒姆弗洛姆的生活变得乏味。饮食单调得令人厌倦——无休止的生熟蘑菇，偶尔佐以驯化怪物的粗韧肉块。尽管礼数周全，这些土著对极北魔法的展示却反应平淡；他们可悲地缺乏宗教热情，使任何传教都徒劳无功。更因其缺乏想象力，甚至对访客来自塞克拉诺什之外的世界都无动于衷。\n\n\"我认为，\"某日艾本对莫吉坦言，\"神明屈尊向此族传递讯息实属谬误。\"\n\n不久后，布勒姆弗洛姆代表团郑重告知：经长期考量，他们被选为下一代父系，将即刻与部落之母完婚，以期孕育出拥有优良头颅的新种族。\n\n面对这份优生学殊荣，艾本与莫吉完全无法接受。想起那座肉山般的雌性，莫吉顿时记起自己的独身圣誓，艾本也恨不能立刻立下相同誓言。审判官震惊得几乎失语，但巫师急智周旋，询问作为坚库姆丈夫的法律与社会地位。天真的布勒姆弗洛姆人透露：这不过是短暂义务，婚后丈夫们将以炖肉等形式成为国民之母的餐点。\n\n极北之民竭力掩饰对这\"殊荣\"的抗拒。深谙外交的艾本甚至代表二人正式应允。但当代表团离去后，他对莫吉说：\n\n\"我比任何时候都确信神明的错误。我们必须尽快离开弗洛尔，继续寻找更配接受神谕的种族。\"\n\n纯朴爱国的布勒姆弗洛姆人从未想过竟会有人拒绝成为下一代父系的荣耀。艾本与莫吉未受任何约束，甚至无人监视。当宿主的鼾声回荡在塞克拉诺什的月环下时，他们轻易离开了住所，沿着通往伊迪姆国度的道路潜行。\n\n月环清辉如昼，照亮前方清晰的路标与沿途诡谲景色。他们跋涉甚远，直至日出后布勒姆弗洛姆人才发现其离去。这些单纯的生物因\"未来父系\"的失踪而困惑不已，甚至未曾想过追赶。\n\n据布勒姆弗洛姆人所述，伊迪姆之地尚隔数里格之遥，其间横亘着灰烬沙漠、矿质仙人掌、菌类森林与崇山峻岭。黎明前，旅人已越过界碑——路旁矗立着部落之母的粗陋石雕。\n\n次日，他们穿行于土星上那些形色各异的奇特种族之间。他们见到了吉比斯族——这群无翼的柱居鸟人常年栖息在各自的石灰岩柱上冥想宇宙奥秘，每隔漫长岁月才相互传递蕴含玄奥思想的三个神秘音节：\"哟普\"、\"耶普\"与\"尤普\"。\n\n他们还遇见了轻浮矮小的埃菲克族，这些家伙在巨型真菌的菌柄中凿穴而居，却因菌菇数日内便会朽烂成灰而不得不频繁迁徙。更听见了格隆族从地底传来的诡异蛙鸣——这个神秘种族不仅畏惧阳光，连土星光环的微光也避之不及，地表居民至今无人得见其真容。\n\n当暮色降临，艾本与莫吉已穿越上述种族的领地，攀至阻隔他们与伊迪姆之国的山麓断崖。在避风的岩架上，疲惫迫使他们停下脚步。既然已无需担忧布莱姆弗洛伊姆族的追捕，二人裹紧斗篷抵御严寒，草草咽下几朵生蘑菇便沉入梦乡。\n\n他们的睡眠被一连串可怖梦魇搅扰。梦中二人皆以为自己被布莱姆弗洛伊姆族擒获，被迫与杰恩库姆结为配偶。黎明前夕，他们从细节清晰得令人发狂的梦境中惊醒，迫不及待地继续登山。\n\n上方的峭壁荒凉得足以吓退任何胆识不足或恐惧不够强烈的旅人。高大的真菌森林很快萎缩成矮小植株，继而退化为地衣般的渺小形态，最终只剩裸露的黑色巉岩。瘦削的艾本攀爬起来尚算轻松，但身躯臃肿的祭司莫吉很快就气喘如牛。每当莫吉停下喘息，艾本便会提醒：\"想想那位国民之母。\"这句话总能令莫吉像头患哮喘的山羊般继续攀爬。\n\n正午时分，他们抵达一处尖峰拱卫的山隘，俯瞰下方的伊迪姆国度。这片丰饶大地上生长着比其他地区更为茂盛的巨型蘑菇与其他菌藻植物，连山坡都更为肥沃——艾本与莫吉刚下行不久便闯入一片巨型马勃菌与毒蕈的丛林。\n\n正当他们惊叹这些菌类的庞大体型时，山顶传来雷鸣般的轰响。声浪越来越近，裹挟着新的雷霆之音。艾本尚未来得及向佐塔库亚祈祷，莫吉也未能向尤恩德女神祈求，山崩引发的巨型马勃菌与毒蕈洪流已将他们席卷而下。在碎裂菌体组成的洪流中，他们以令人眩晕的速度在一分钟内完成了下山之旅。\n\n当二人挣扎着从菌类残骸堆里爬出时，发现山崩虽止，喧哗未歇。菌堆中另有诡异的蠕动。待他们探出头颈，才看清骚动源自一群与布莱姆弗洛伊姆族迥异、长着原始头颅的生物——正是遭遇山崩的伊迪姆族人。\n\n被掩埋的城镇里，屋顶与塔尖正从乱石菌堆中浮现。两位极北来客面前有座神庙般的建筑，成群伊迪姆人正从堵塞的门洞掘路而出。看见艾本与莫吉后，他们停下工作。确认自己四肢完好的巫师趁机高声宣告：\n\n\"听好了！\"他煞有介事地说，\"我奉赫祖尔奎格姆扎赫神谕而来。历经千难万险，我忠实地传递这句神圣箴言：'伊奎·德洛什·奥德克弗农克'。\"\n\n由于使用布莱姆弗洛伊姆方言，伊迪姆人或许未能理解前半段。但赫祖尔奎格姆扎赫是他们的守护神，他们通晓神之语言。当\"伊奎·德洛什·奥德克弗农克\"响起时，整个部落突然陷入狂热的忙碌：喉音命令此起彼伏，更多头颅四肢从菌堆中钻出。\n\n神庙中涌出的族人扛来了赫祖尔奎格姆扎赫的巨大神像、数尊较小盟神像，以及一尊艾本与莫吉都认得的、酷似佐塔库亚的古旧偶像。其他伊迪姆人则携家带口，示意两位极北来客随他们撤离城镇。\n\n直到新城镇在菌林平原上建成，二人才明白\"伊奎·德洛什·奥德克弗农克\"不过是句逐客令。但山崩与神谕的巧合，使伊迪姆人将此视为迁移的神圣旨意。这座名为\"格隆夫\"的新城再不受山崩威胁。\n\n艾本借机宣扬仍在赛克拉诺什地区受崇拜的佐塔库亚，俨然成为小先知。莫吉虽因无法在此建立宗教法庭而闷闷不乐，但伊迪姆人的菌菇酒与雌性生物终究提供了些许慰藉。二人最终在此定居，过上了与故乡穆·图兰相差无几的教职生活。\n\n而在穆·图兰北海岬角的黑片麻岩塔楼里，莫吉的随从们既不敢穿越魔法门扉，又不敢违命离开，苦等多日后才被临时继任者召回。这场风波导致尤恩德信仰衰微，佐塔库亚的黑暗崇拜在大冰期来临前的最后一个世纪席卷了整个穆·图兰。"

        "content": "\n\nIt has become needful for me, who am no wielder of the stylus of bronze or the pen of calamus, and whose only proper tool is the long, double-handed sword, to indite this account of the curious and lamentable happenings which foreran the universal desertion of Commoriom by its king and its people. This I am well-fitted to do, for I played a signal part in these happenings; and I left the city only when all the others had gone.\n\nNow Commoriom, as everyone knows, was aforetime the resplendent, high-built capital, and the marble and granite crown of all Hyperborea. But, concerning the cause of its abandonment, there are now so many warring legends and so many tales of a false and fabulous character, that I, who am old in years and triply old in horrors, I, who have grown weary with no less than eleven lustrums of public service, am compelled to write this record of the truth ere it fade utterly from the tongues and memories of men. And this I do, though the telling thereof will include a confession of my one defeat, my one failure in the dutiful administration of a committed task.\n\nFor those who will read the narrative in future years, and haply in future lands, I shall now introduce myself. I am Athammaus, the chief headsman of Uzuldaroum, who held formerly the same office in Commoriom. My father, Manghai Thal, was headsman before me; and the sires of my father, even to the mythic generations of the primal kings, have wielded the great copper sword of justice on the block of eighon-wood.\n\nForgive an aged man if he seem to dwell, as is the habit of the old, among the youthful recollections that have gathered to themselves the kingly purple of removed horizons and the strange glory that illumines irretrievable things. Lo! I am made young again when I recall Commoriom, when in this grey city of the sunken years I behold in retrospect her walls that looked mountainously down upon the jungle, and the alabastrine multitude of her heaven-fretting spires. Opulent among cities, and superb and magisterial, and paramount over all was Commoriom, to whom tribute was given from the shores of the Atlantean sea to that sea in which is the immense continent of Mu; to whom the traders came from utmost Thulan that is walled on the north with unknown ice, and from the southern realm of Tscho Vulpanomi which ends in a lake of boiling asphaltum. Ah! proud and lordly was Commoriom, and her humblest dwellings were more than the palaces of other cities. And it was not, as men fable nowadays, because of that maundering prophecy once uttered by the White Sybil from the isle of snow which is named Polarion, that her splendor and spaciousness was delivered over to the spotted vines of the jungle and the spotted snakes. Nay, it was because of a direr thing than this, and a tangible horror against which the law of kings, the wisdom of hierophants and the sharpness of swords were alike impotent. Ah! not lightly was she overcome, not easily were her defenders driven forth. And though others forget, or haply deem her no more than a vain and dubitable tale, I shall never cease to lament Commoriom.\n\nMy sinews have dwindled grievously now; and Time has drunken stealthily from my veins; and has touched my hair with the ashes of suns extinct. But in the days whereof I tell, there was no braver and more stalwart headsman than I in the whole of Hyperborea; and my name was a red menace, a loudly spoken warning to the evil-doers of the forest and the town, and the savage robbers of uncouth outland tribes. Wearing the blood-bright purple of my office, I stood each morning in the public square where all might attend and behold, and performed for the edification of all men my allotted task. And each day the tough, golden-ruddy copper of the huge crescent blade was darkened not once but many times with a rich and wine-like sanguine. And because of my never-faltering arm, my infallible eye, and the clean blow which there was never any necessity to repeat, I was much honored by the King Loquamethros and by the populace of Commoriom.\n\nI remember well, on account of their more than unique atrocity, the earliest rumors that came to me in my active life regarding the outlaw Knygathin Zhaum. This person belonged to an obscure and highly unpleasant people called the Voormis, who dwelt in the black Eiglophian Mountains at a full day's journey from Commoriom, and inhabited according to their tribal custom the caves of ferine animals less savage than themselves, which they had slain or otherwise dispossessed. They were generally looked upon as more beast-like than human, because of their excessive hairiness and the vile, ungodly rites and usages to which they were addicted. It was mainly from among these beings that the notorious Knygathin Zhaum had recruited his formidable band, who were terrorizing the hills subjacent to the Eiglophian Mountains with daily deeds of the most infamous and iniquitous rapine. Wholesale robbery was the least of their crimes; and mere anthropophagism was far from being the worst.\n\nIt will readily be seen, from this, that the Voormis were a somewhat aboriginal race, with an ethnic heritage of the darkest and most revolting type. And it was commonly said that Knygathin Zhaum himself possessed an even murkier strain of ancestry than the others, being related on the maternal side to that queer, non-anthropomorphic god, Tsathoggua, who was worshipped so widely during the sub-human cycles. And there were those who whispered of even stranger blood (if one could properly call it blood) and a monstrous linkage with the swart Protean spawn that had come down with Tsathoggua from elder worlds and exterior dimensions where physiology and geometry had both assumed an altogether inverse trend of development. And, because of this mingling of ultra-cosmic strains, it was said that the body of Knygathin Zhaum, unlike his shaggy, umber-colored fellow-tribesmen, was hairless from crown to heel and was pied with great spots of black and yellow; and moreover he himself was reputed to exceed all others in his cruelty and cunning.\n\nFor a long time this execrable outlaw was no more to me than an horrific name; but inevitably I thought of him with a certain professional interest. There were many who believed him invulnerable by any weapon, and who told of his having escaped in a manner which none could elucidate from more than one dungeon whose walls were not to be scaled or pierced by mortal beings. But of course I discounted all such tales, for my official experience had never yet included anyone with properties or abilities of a like sort. And I knew well the superstitiousness of the vulgar multitude.\n\nFrom day to day new reports reached me amid the preoccupations of never-slighted duty. This noxious marauder was not content with the seemingly ample sphere of operations afforded by his native mountains and the outlying hill-regions with their fertile valleys and well-peopled towns. His forays became bolder and more extensive; till one night he descended on a village so near to Commoriom that it was usually classed as a suburb. Here he and his feculent crew committed numerous deeds of an unspecifiable enormity; and bearing with them many of the villagers for purposes even less designable, they retired to their caves in the glassy-walled Eiglophian peaks ere the ministers of justice could overtake them.\n\nIt was this audaciously offensive act which prompted the law to exert its full power and vigilance against Knygathin Zhaum, Before that, he and his men had been left to the local officers of the country-side; but now his misdeeds were such as to demand the rigorous attention of the constabulary of Commoriom. Henceforth all his movements were followed as closely as possible; the towns where he might descend were strictly guarded; and traps were set everywhere.\n\nEven thus, Knygathin Zhaum contrived to evade capture for month after month; and all the while he repeated his far-flung raids with an embarrassing frequency. It was almost by chance, or through his own foolhardiness, that he was eventually taken in broad daylight on the highway near the city's outskirts. Contrary to all expectation, in view of his renowned ferocity, he made no resistance whatever; but finding himself surrounded by mailed archers and bill-bearers, he yielded to them at once with an oblique, enigmatic smile—a smile that troubled for many nights thereafter the dreams of all who were present.\n\nFor reasons which were never explained, he was altogether alone when taken; and none of his fellows were captured either coincidentally or subsequently. Nevertheless, there was much excitement and jubilation in Commoriom, and everyone was curious to behold the dreaded outlaw. More even than others, perhaps, I felt the stirrings of interest; for upon me, in due course, the proper decapitation of Knygathin Zhaum would devolve.\n\nFrom hearing the hideous rumors and legends whose nature I have already outlined, I was prepared for something out of the ordinary in the way of criminal personality. But even at first sight, when I watched him as he was borne to prison through a moiling crowd, Knygathin Zhaum surpassed the most sinister and disagreeable anticipations. He was naked to the waist, and wore the fulvous hide of some long-haired animal which hung in filthy tatters to his knees. Such details, however, contributed little to those elements in his appearance which revolted and even shocked me. His limbs, his body, his lineaments were outwardly formed like those of aboriginal man; and one might even have allowed for his utter hairlessness, in which there was a remote and blasphemously caricatural suggestion of the shaven priest; and even the broad, formless mottling of his skin, like that of a huge boa, might somehow have been glossed over as a rather extravagant peculiarity of pigmentation. It was something else, it was the unctuous, verminous ease, the undulant litheness and fluidity of his every movement, seeming to hint at an inner structure and vertebration that were less than human—or, one might almost have said, a sub-ophidian lack of all bony frame-work—which made me view the captive, and also my incumbent task, with an unparallelable distaste. He seemed to slither rather than walk; and the very fashion of his jointure, the placing of knees, hips, elbows and shoulders, appeared arbitrary and factitious. One felt that the outward semblance of humanity was a mere concession to anatomical convention; and that his corporeal formation might easily have assumed—and might still assume at any instant—the unheard-of outlines and concept-defying dimensions that prevail in trans-galactic worlds. Indeed, I could now believe the outrageous tales concerning his ancestry. And with equal horror and curiosity I wondered what the stroke of justice would reveal, and what noisome, mephitic ichor would befoul the impartial sword in lieu of honest blood.\n\nIt is needless to record in circumstantial detail the process by which Knygathin Zhaum was tried and condemned for his manifold enormities. The workings of the law were implacably swift and sure, and their equity permitted of no quibbling or delay. The captive was confined in an oubliette below the main dungeons—a cell hewn in the basic, Archean gneiss at a profound depth, with no entrance other than a hole through which he was lowered and drawn up by means of a long rope and windlass. This hole was lidded with a huge block and was guarded day and night by a dozen men-at-arms. However, there was no attempt at escape on the part of Knygathin Zhaum: indeed, he seemed unnaturally resigned to his prospective doom. To me, who have always been possessed of a strain of prophetic intuition, there was something overtly ominous in this unlooked-for resignation. Also, I did not like the demeanor of the prisoner during his trial. The silence which he had preserved at all times following his capture and incarceration was still maintained before his judges. Though interpreters who knew the harsh, sibilant Eiglophian dialect were provided, he would make no answer to questions; and he offered no defense. Least of all did I like the unabashed and unblinking manner in which he received the final pronouncement of death which was uttered in the high court of Commoriom by eight judges in turn and solemnly re-affirmed at the end by King Loquamethros. After that, I looked well to the sharpening of my sword, and promised myself that I would concentrate all the resources of a brawny arm and a flawless manual artistry upon the forthcoming execution.\n\nMy task was not long deferred, for the usual interval of a fortnight between condemnation and decapitation had been shortened to three days in view of the suspicious peculiarities of Knygathin Zhaum and the heinous magnitude of his proven crimes.\n\nOn the morning appointed, after a night that had been rendered dismal by a long-drawn succession of the most abominable dreams, I went with my unfailing punctuality to the block of eighon-wood, which was situated with geometrical exactness in the center of the main square. Here a huge crowd had already gathered; and the clear amber sun blazed royally down on the silver and nacarat of court dignitaries, the hodden of merchants and artisans, and the rough pelts that were worn by outland people.\n\nWith a like punctuality, Knygathin Zhaum soon appeared amid his entourage of guards, who surrounded him with a bristling hedge of bill-hooks and lances and tridents. At the same time, all the outer avenues of the city, as well as the entrances to the square, were guarded by massed soldiery, for it was feared that the uncaught members of the desperate outlaw band might make an effort to rescue their infamous chief at the last moment.\n\nAmid the unremitting vigilance of his warders, Knygathin Zhaum came forward, fixing upon me the intent but inexpressive gaze of his lidless, ochre-yellow eyes, in which a face-to-face scrutiny could discern no pupils. He knelt down beside the block, presenting his mottled nape without a tremor. As I looked upon him with a calculating eye, and made ready for the lethal stroke, I was impressed more powerfully and more disagreeably than ever by the feeling of a loathsome, underlying plasticity, an invertebrate structure, nauseous and non-terrestrial, beneath his impious mockery of human form. And I could not help perceiving also the air of abnormal coolness, of abstract, impenetrable cynicism, that was maintained by all his parts and members. He was like a torpid snake, or some huge liana of the jungle, that is wholly unconscious of the shearing axe. I was well aware that I might be dealing with things which were beyond the ordinary province of a public headsman; but nathless I lifted the great sword in a clean, symmetrically flashing arc, and brought it down on the piebald nape with all of my customary force and address.\n\nNecks differ in the sensations which they afford to one's hand beneath the penetrating blade. In this case, I can only say that the sensation was not such as I have grown to associate with the cleaving of any known animal substance. But I saw with relief that the blow had been successful: the head of Knygathin Zhaum lay cleanly severed on the porous block, and his body sprawled on the pavement without even a single quiver of departing animation. As I had expected, there was no blood—only a black, tarry, fetid exudation, far from copious, which ceased in a few minutes and vanished utterly from my sword and from the eighon-wood. Also, the inner anatomy which the blade had revealed was devoid of all legitimate vertebration. But to all appearance Knygathin Zhaum had yielded up his obscene life; and the sentence of King Loquamethros and the eight judges of Commoriom had been fulfilled with a legal precision.\n\nProudly but modestly I received the applause of the waiting multitudes, who bore willing witness to the consummation of my official task and were loudly jubilant over the dead scourge. After seeing that the remains of Knygathin Zhaum were given into the hands of the public grave-diggers, who always disposed of such offal, I left the square and returned to my home, since no other decapitations had been set for that day. My conscience was serene, and I felt that I had acquitted myself worthily in the performance of a far from pleasant duty.\n\nKnygathin Zhaum, as was the custom in dealing with the bodies of the most nefarious criminals, was interred with contumelious haste in a barren field outside the city where people cast their orts and rubbish. He was left in an unmarked and unmounded grave between two middens. The power of the law had now been amply vindicated; and everyone was satisfied, from Loquamethros himself to the villagers that had suffered from the depredations of the deceased outlaw.\n\nI retired that night, after a bounteous meal of suvana-fruit and djongua-beans, well-irrigated with foum-wine. From a moral standpoint, I had every reason to sleep the sleep of the virtuous; but, even as on the preceding night, I was made the victim of one cacodemoniacal dream after another. Of these dreams, I recall only their pervading, unifying consciousness of insufferable suspense, of monotonously cumulative horror without shape or name; and the ever-torturing sentiment of vain repetition and dark, hopeless toil and frustration. Also, there is a half-memory, which refuses to assume any approach to visual form, of things that were never intended for human perception or human cogitation; and the aforesaid sentiment, and all the horror, were dimly but indissolubly bound up with these. Awaking unrefreshed and weary from what seemed an aeon of thankless endeavor, of treadmill bafflement, I could only impute my nocturnal sufferings to the djongua-beans; and decided that I must have eaten all too liberally of these nutritious viands. Mercifully, I did not suspect in my dreams the dark, portentous symbolism that was soon to declare itself.\n\nNow must I write the things that are formidable unto Earth and the dwellers of Earth; the things that exceed all human or terrene regimen; that subvert reason; that mock the dimensions and defy biology. Dire is the tale; and, after seven lustrums, the tremor of an olden fear still agitates my hand as I write.\n\nBut of such things I was still oblivious when I sallied forth that morning to the place of execution, where three criminals of a quite average sort, whose very cephalic contours I have forgotten along with their offenses, were to meet their well-deserved doom beneath my capable arm. Howbeit, I had not gone far when I heard an unconscionable uproar that was spreading swiftly from street to street, from alley to alley throughout Commoriom. I distinguished a myriad cries of rage, horror, fear and lamentation that were seemingly caught up and repeated by everyone who chanced to be abroad at that hour. Meeting some of the citizenry, who were plainly in a state of the most excessive agitation and were still continuing their outcries, I inquired the reason of all this clamor. And thereupon I learned from them that Knygathin Zhaum, whose illicit career was presumably at an end, had now re-appeared and had signalized the unholy miracle of his return by the commission of a most appalling act on the main avenue before the very eyes of early passers! He had seized a respectable seller of djongua-beans, and had proceeded instantly to devour his victim alive, without heeding the blows, bricks, arrows, javelins, cobblestones and curses that were rained upon him by the gathering throng and by the police. It was only when he had satisfied his atrocious appetite, that he suffered the police to lead him away, leaving little more than the bones and raiment of the djongua-seller to mark the spot of this outrageous happening. Since the case was without legal parallel, Knygathin Zhaum had been thrown once more into the oubliette below the city dungeons, to await the will of Loquamethros and the eight judges.\n\nThe exceeding discomfiture, the profound embarrassment felt by myself, as well as by the people and the magistracy of Commoriom, can well be imagined. As everyone bore witness, Knygathin Zhaum had been efficiently beheaded and buried according to the customary ritual; and his resurrection was not only against nature but involved a most contumelious and highly mystifying breach of the law. In fact, the legal aspects of the case were such as to render necessary the immediate passing of a special statute, calling for re-judgement, and allowing re-execution, of such malefactors as might thus-wise return from their lawful graves. Apart from all this, there was general consternation; and even at that early date, the more ignorant and more religious among the townsfolk were prone to regard the matter as an omen of some impending civic calamity.\n\nAs for me, my scientific turn of mind, which repudiated the supernatural, led me to seek an explanation of the problem in the non-terrestrial side of Knygathin Zhaum's ancestry. I felt sure that the forces of an alien biology, the properties of a transtellar life-substance, were somehow involved.\n\nWith the spirit of the true investigator, I summoned the grave-diggers who had interred Knygathin Zhaum and bade them lead me to his place of sepulture in the refuse-grounds. Here a most singular condition disclosed itself. The earth had not been disturbed, apart from a deep hole at one end of the grave, such as might have been made by a large rodent. No body of human size, or, at least, of human form, could possibly have emerged from this hole. At my command, the diggers removed all the loose soil, mingled with potsherds and other rubbish, which they had heaped upon the beheaded outlaw. When they reached the bottom, nothing was found but a slight stickiness where the corpse had lain; and this, along with an odor of ineffable foulness which was its concomitant, soon dissipated itself in the open air.\n\nBaffled, and more mystified than ever, but still sure that the enigma would permit of some natural solution, I awaited the new trial. This time, the course of justice was even quicker and less given to quibbling than before. The prisoner was again condemned, and the time of decapitation was delayed only till the following morn. A proviso concerning burial was added to the sentence: the remains were to be sealed in a strong wooden sarcophagus, the sarcophagus was to be inhumed in a deep pit in the solid stone, and the pit filled with massy boulders. These measures, it was felt, should serve amply to restrain the unwholesome and irregular inclinations of this obnoxious miscreant.\n\nWhen Knygathin Zhaum was again brought before me, amid a redoubled guard and a throng that overflowed the square and all of the outlying avenues, I viewed him with profound concern and with more than my former repulsion. Having a good memory for anatomic details, I noticed some odd changes in his physique. The huge splotches of dull black and sickly yellow that had covered him from head to heel were now somewhat differently distributed. The shifting of the facial blotches, around the eyes and mouth, had given him an expression that was both grim and sardonic to an unbearable degree. Also, there was a perceptible shortening of his neck, though the place of cleavage and re-union, midway between head and shoulders, had left no mark whatever. And looking at his limbs, I discerned other and more subtle changes. Despite my acumen in physical matters, I found myself unwilling to speculate regarding the processes that might underlie these alterations; and still less did I wish to surmise the problematic results of their continuation, if such should ensue. Hoping fervently that Knygathin Zhaum and the vile, flagitious properties of his unhallowed carcass would now be brought to a permanent end, I raised the sword of justice high in air and smote with heroic might.\n\nOnce again, as far as mortal eye was able to determine, the effects of the shearing blow were all that could be desired. The head rolled forward on the eighon-wood, and the torso and its members fell and lay supinely on the maculated flags. From a legal view-point, this doubly nefandous malefactor was now twice dead.\n\nHowbeit, this time I superintended in person the disposal of the remains, and saw to the bolting of the fine sarcophagus of apha-wood in which they were laid, and the filling with chosen boulders of the ten-foot pit into which the sarcophagus was lowered. It required three men to lift even the least of these boulders. We all felt that the irrepressible Knygathin Zhaum was due for a quietus.\n\nAlas! for the vanity of earthly hopes and labors! The morrow came with its unspeakable, incredible tale of renewed outrage: once more the weird, semi-human offender was abroad, once more his anthropophagic lust had taken toll from among the honorable denizens of Commoriom. He had eaten no less a personage than one of the eight judges; and, not satisfied with picking the bones of this rather obese individual, had devoured by way of dessert the more outstanding facial features of one of the police who had tried to deter him from finishing his main course. All this, as before, was done amid the frantic protests of a great throng. After a final nibbling at the scant vestiges of the unfortunate constable's left ear, Knygathin Zhaum had seemed to experience a feeling of repletion and had suffered himself to be led docilely away once more by the jailers.\n\nI, and the others who had helped me in the arduous toils of entombment, were more than astounded when we heard the news. And the effect on the general public was indeed deplorable. The more superstitious and timid began leaving the city forthwith; and there was much revival of forgotten prophecies; and much talk among the various priesthoods anent the necessity of placating with liberal sacrifice their mystically angered gods and eidolons. Such nonsense I was wholly able to disregard; but, under the circumstances, the persistent return of Knygathin Zhaum was no less alarming to science than to religion.\n\nWe examined the tomb, if only as a matter of form; and found that certain of the superincumbent boulders had been displaced in such a manner as to admit the outward passage of a body with the lateral dimensions of some large snake or musk-rat. The sarcophagus, with its metal bolts, was bursten at one end; and we shuddered to think of the immeasurable force that must have been employed in its disruption.\n\nBecause of the way in which the case overpassed all known biologic laws, the formalities of civil law were now waived; and I, Athammaus, was called upon that same day before the sun had reached its meridian, and was solemnly charged with the office of re-beheading Knygathin Zhaum at once. The interment or other disposal of the remains was left to my discretion; and the local soldiery and constabulary were all placed at my command, if I should require them.\n\nDeeply conscious of the honor thus implied, and sorely perplexed but undaunted, I went forth to the scene of my labors. When the criminal re-appeared, it was obvious not only to me but to everyone that his physical personality, in achieving this new recrudescence, had undergone a most salient change. His mottling had developed more than a suggestion of some startling and repulsive pattern; and his human characteristics had yielded to the inroads of an unearthly distortion. The head was joined to the shoulders almost without the intermediation of a neck; the eyes were set diagonally in a face with oblique bulgings and flattenings; the nose and mouth were showing a tendency to displace each other; and there were still further alterations which I shall not specify, since they involved an abhorrent degradation of man's noblest and most distinctive corporeal members. I shall, however, mention the strange, pendulous formations, like annulated dew-laps or wattles, into which his knee-caps had evolved. Nathless, it was Knygathin Zhaum himself who stood (if one could dignify the fashion of his carriage by that word) before the block of justice.\n\nBecause of the virtual non-existence of a nape, the third beheading called for a precision of eye and a nicety of hand which, in all likelihood, no other headsman than myself could have shown. I rejoice to say that my skill was adequate to the demand thus made upon it; and once again the culprit was shorn of his vile cephaloid appendage. But if the blade had gone even a little to either side, the dismemberment entailed would have been technically of another sort than decapitation.\n\nThe laborious care with which I and my assistants conducted the third inhumation was indeed deserving of success. We laid the body in a strong sarcophagus of bronze, and the head in a second but smaller sarcophagus of the same material. The lids were then soldered down with molten metal; and after this the two sarcophagi were conveyed to opposite parts of Commoriom. The one containing the body was buried at a great depth beneath monumental masses of stone; but that which enclosed the head I left uninterred, proposing to watch over it all night in company with a guard of armed men. I also appointed a numerous guard to keep vigil above the burial-place of the body.\n\nNight came; and with seven trusty trident-bearers I went forth to the place where we had left the smaller of the two sarcophagi. This was in the courtyard of a deserted mansion amid the suburbs, far from the haunts of the populace. For weapons, I myself wore a short falchion and carried a great bill. We took along a plentiful supply of torches, so that we might not lack for light in our gruesome vigil; and we fit several of them at once and stuck them in crevices between the flag-stones of the court, in such wise that they formed a circle of lurid flames about the sarcophagus.\n\nWe had also brought with us an abundance of the crimson foum-wine in leathern bottles, and dice of mammoth-ivory with which to beguile the black nocturnal hours; and eyeing our charge with a casual but careful vigilance, we applied ourselves discreetly to the wine and began to play for small sums of no more than five pazoors, as is the wont of good gamblers till they have taken their opponents' measure.\n\nThe darkness deepened apace; and in the square of sapphire overhead, to which the illumination of our torches had given a jetty tinge, we saw Polaris and the red planets that looked down for the last time upon Commoriom in her glory. But we dreamed not of the nearness of disaster, but jested bravely and drank in ribald mockery to the monstrous head that was now so securely coffined and so remotely sundered from its odious body. The wine passed and re-passed among us; and its rosy spirit mounted in our brains; and we played for bolder stakes; and the game quickened to a goodly frenzy.\n\nI know not how many stars had gone over us in the smoky heavens, nor how many times I had availed myself of the ever-circling bottles. But I remember well that I had won no less than ninety pazoors from the trident-bearers, who were all swearing lustily and loudly as they strove in vain to stem the tide of my victory. I, as well as the others, had wholly forgotten the object of our vigil.\n\nThe sarcophagus containing the head was one that had been primarily designed for the reception of a small child. Its present use, one might have argued, was a sinful and sacrilegious waste of fine bronze; but nothing else of proper size and adequate strength was available at the time. In the mounting fervor of the game, as I have hinted, we had all ceased to watch this receptacle; and I shudder to think how long there may have been something visibly or even audibly amiss before the unwonted and terrifying behavior of the sarcophagus was forced upon our attention. It was the sudden, loud, metallic clangor, like that of a smitten gong or shield, which made us realize that all things were not as they should have been; and turning unanimously in the direction of the sound, we saw that the sarcophaghus was heaving and pitching in a most unseemly fashion amid its ring of flaring torches. First on one end or corner, then on another, it danced and pirouetted, clanging resonantly all the while on the granite pavement.\n\nThe true horror of the situation had scarcely seeped into our brains, ere a new and even more ghastly development occurred. We saw that the casket was bulging ominously at top and sides and bottom, and was rapidly losing all similitude to its rightful form. Its rectangular outlines swelled and curved and were horribly erased as in the changes of a nightmare, till the thing became a slightly oblong sphere; and then, with a most appalling noise, it began to split at the welded edges of the lid, and burst violently asunder. Through the long, ragged rift there poured in hellish ebullition a dark, ever-swelling mass of incognizable matter, frothing as with the venomous foam of a million serpents, hissing as with the yeast of fermenting wine, and putting forth here and there great sooty-looking bubbles that were large as pig-bladders. Overturning several of the torches, it rolled in an inundating wave across the flagstones and we all sprang back in the most abominable fright and stupefaction to avoid it.\n\nCowering against the rear wall of the courtyard, while the overthrown torches flickered wildly and smokily, we watched the remarkable actions of the mass, which had paused as if to collect itself, and was now subsiding like a sort of infernal dough. It shrank, it fell in, till after awhile its dimensions began to re-approach those of the encoffined head, though they still lacked any true semblance of its shape. The thing became a round, blackish ball, on whose palpitating surface the nascent outlines of random features were limned with the flatness of a drawing. There was one lidless eye, tawny, pupilless and phosphoric, that stared upon us from the center of the ball while the thing appeared to be making up its mind. It lay still for more than a minute; then, with a catapulting bound, it sprang past us toward the open entrance of the courtyard, and disappeared from our ken on the midnight streets.\n\nDespite our amazement and disconcertion, we were able to note the general direction in which it had gone. This, to our further terror and confoundment, was toward the portion of Commoriom in which the body of Knygathin Zhaum had been intombed. We dared not conjecture the meaning of it all, and the probable outcome. But, though there were a million fears and apprehensions to deter us, we seized our weapons and followed on the path of that unholy head with all the immediacy and all the forthrightness of motion which a goodly cargo of foum-wine would permit.\n\nNo one other than ourselves was abroad at an hour when even the most dissolute revellers had either gone home or had succumbed to their potations under tavern tables. The streets were dark, and were somehow drear and cheerless; and the stars above them were half-stifled as by the invading mist of a pestilential miasma. We went on, following a main street, and the pavements echoed to our tread in the stillness with a hollow sound, as if the solid stone beneath them had been honeycombed with mausolean vaults in the interim of our weird vigil.\n\nIn all our wanderings, we found no sign of that supremely noxious and execrable thing which had issued from the riven sarcophagus. Nor, to our relief, and contrary to all our fears, did we encounter anything of an allied or analogous nature, such as might be abroad if our surmises were correct. But, near the central square of Commoriom, we met with a number of men, carrying bills and tridents and torches, who proved to be the guards I had posted that evening above the tomb of Knygathin Zhaum's body. These men were in a state of pitiable agitation; and they told us a fearsome tale, of how the deep-hewn tomb and the monumental blocks of stone that were piled within it had heaved as with the throes of earthquake; and of how a python-shapen mass of frothing and hissing matter had poured forth from amid the blocks and had vanished into the darkness toward Commoriom. In return, we told them of that which had happened during our vigil in the courtyard; and we all agreed that a great foulness, a thing more baneful than beast or serpent, was again loose and ravening in the night. And we spoke only in shocked whispers of what the morrow might declare.\n\nUniting our forces, we searched the city, combing cautiously its alleys and its thoroughfares and dreading with the dread of brave men the dark, iniquitous spawn on which the light of our torches might fail at any turn or in any nook or portal. But the search was vain; and the stars grew faint above us in a livid sky; and the dawn came in among the marble spires with a glimmering of ghostly silver; and a thin, phantasmal amber was sifted on walls and pavements.\n\nSoon there were footsteps other than ours that echoed through the town; and one by one the familiar clangors and clamors of life awoke. Early passers appeared; and the sellers of fruits and milk and legumes came in from the country-side. But of that which we sought there was still no trace.\n\nWe went on, while the city continued to resume its matutinal activities around us. Then, abruptly, with no warning, and under circumstances that would have startled the most robust and affrayed the most valorous, we came upon our quarry. We were entering the square in which was the eighon-block whereon so many thousand miscreants had laid their piacular necks, when we heard an outcry of mortal dread and agony such as only one thing in the world could have occasioned. Hurrying on, we saw that two wayfarers, who had been crossing the square near the block of justice, were struggling and writhing in the clutch of an unequalled monster which both natural history and fable would have repudiated.\n\nIn spite of the baffling, ambiguous oddities which the thing displayed, we identified it as Knygathin Zhaum when we drew closer. The head, in its third re-union with that detestable torso, had attached itself in a semi-flattened manner to the region of the lower chest and diaphragm; and during the process of this novel coalescence, one eye had slipped away from all relation with its fellow or the head and was now occupying the navel, just below the embossment of the chin. Other and even more shocking alterations had occurred: the arms had lengthened into tentacles, with fingers that were like knots of writhing vipers; and where the head would normally have been, the shoulders had reared themselves to a cone-shaped eminence that ended in a cup-like mouth. Most fabulous and impossible of all, however, were the changes in the nether limbs: at each knee and hip, they had re-bifurcated into long, lithe proboscides that were lined with throated suckers. By making a combined use of its various mouths and members, the abnormality was devouring both of the hapless persons whom it had seized.\n\nDrawn by the outcries, a crowd gathered behind us as we neared this atrocious tableau. The whole city seemed to fill with a well-nigh instantaneous clamor, an ever-swelling hubbub, in which the dominant note was one of supreme, all-devastating terror.\n\nI shall not speak of our feelings as officers and men. It was plain to us that the ultra-mundane factors in Knygathin Zhaum's ancestry had asserted themselves with a hideously accelerative ratio, following his latest resurrection. But, maugre this, and the wholly stupendous enormity of the miscreation before us, we were still prepared to fulfill our duty and defend as best we could the helpless populace. I boast not of the heroism required: we were simple men, and should have done only that which we were visibly called upon to do.\n\nWe surrounded the monster, and would have assailed it immediately with our bills and tridents. But here an embarrassing difficulty disclosed itself: the creature before us had entwined itself so tortuously and inextricably with its prey, and the whole group was writhing and tossing so violently, that we could not use our weapons without grave danger of impaling or otherwise injuring our two fellow-citizens. At length, however, the strugglings and heavings grew less vehement, as the substance and life-blood of the men was consumed; and the loathsome mass of devourer and devoured became gradually quiescent.\n\nNow, if ever, was our opportunity; and I am sure we should all have rallied to the attack, useless and vain as it would certainly have been. But plainly the monster had grown weary of all such trifling and would no longer submit himself to the petty annoyance of human molestation. As we raised our weapons and made ready to strike, the thing drew back, still carrying its vein-drawn, flaccid victims, and climbed upon the eighon-block. Here, before the eyes of all assembled, it began to swell in every part, in every member, as if it were inflating itself with a superhuman rancor and malignity. The rate at which the swelling progressed, and the proportions which the thing attained as it covered the block from sight and lapsed down on every side with undulating, inundating folds, would have been enough to daunt the heroes of remotest myth. The bloating of the main torso, I might add, was more lateral than vertical. When the abnormality began to present dimensions that were beyond those of any creature of this world, and to bulge aggressively toward us with a slow, interminable stretching of boa-like arms, my valiant and redoubtable companions were scarcely to be censured for retreating. And even less can I blame the general population, who were now evacuating Commoriom in torrential multitudes, with shrill cries and wailings. Their flight was no doubt accelerated by the vocal sounds, which, for the first time during our observation, were being emitted by the monster. These sounds partook of the character of hissings more than anything else; but their volume was overpowering, their timbre was a torment and a nausea to the ear; and, worst of all, they were issuing not only from the diaphragmic mouth but from each of the various other oral openings or suckers which the horror had developed. Even I, Athammaus, drew back from those hissings and stood well beyond reach of the coiling serpentine fingers.\n\nI am proud to say, however, that I lingered on the edge of the empty square for some time, with more than one backward and regretful glance. The thing that had been Knygathin Zhaum was seemingly content with its triumph; and it brooded supine and mountainous above the vanquished eighon-block. Its myriad hisses sank to a slow, minor sibilation such as might issue from a family of somnolent pythons; and it made no overt attempt to assail or even approach me. But seeing at last that the professional problem which it offered was quite insoluble; and divining moreover that Commoriom was by now entirely without a king, a judicial system, a constabulary or a people, I finally abandoned the doomed city and followed the others.",
        "content_cn": "我，一个不擅青铜刻刀与芦苇笔的人，唯一的称手工具是那柄双手巨剑，如今却不得不提笔记述那些离奇而可悲的事件——正是这些事件导致了科莫里奥姆城的君王与臣民集体弃城而去。由我来执笔再合适不过，因为我亲身参与了这些事件；直到所有人离去后，我才最后离开那座城。\n\n众所周知，科莫里奥姆曾是北极乐土全境最辉煌的高耸都城，犹如大理石与花岗岩铸就的冠冕。但关于它遭废弃的缘由，如今流传着太多互相矛盾的传说与荒诞不经的故事。作为历经沧桑的老者——我不仅年岁已高，更在三倍于常人的恐怖经历中衰老，在长达五十五载的公职生涯中耗尽心力——我必须在真相从人类口舌与记忆中彻底消逝前，写下这份实录。尽管这将迫使我承认此生唯一的败绩，承认自己在履行职责时的唯一失职。\n\n为后世异域的读者计，容我自陈身份：我是阿萨玛斯，乌祖尔达鲁姆的首席刽子手，此前亦在科莫里奥姆担任同职。先父曼海·萨尔曾执掌此位；而吾族血脉可追溯至神话时代的初代君王，世代以正义的青铜巨剑在艾贡木砧上行刑。\n\n请原谅老者总爱沉湎于青春回忆的习惯——那些记忆已被逝去岁月染上帝王般的紫晕，被不可复得之物的奇异光辉所照亮。看啊！当我想起科莫里奥姆，在这沉沦年代的灰暗城池中回望她高耸入云的城墙与无数雪花石膏尖塔时，仿佛重获青春。这座富丽堂皇、威严至尊的都市曾接受从亚特兰蒂斯海到穆大陆海域的朝贡；商旅们从北方冰墙之外的图兰，从以沸腾沥青湖为界的南方楚沃帕诺米王国远道而来。啊！骄傲尊贵的科莫里奥姆，她最简陋的屋舍也胜过别城的宫殿。而她沦落为丛林斑驳藤蔓与毒蛇盘踞之地的缘由，绝非如今人们谣传的那位极地岛白发女巫的谵妄预言。不，是因为某种更可怕的存在，某种令王权律法、祭司智慧与利剑锋芒皆尽失效的有形恐怖。啊！她并非轻易沦陷，她的守卫者也非懦弱溃逃。纵使世人遗忘，或将她视为虚妄传说，我永远为科莫里奥姆哀悼。\n\n如今我的筋肉已可怕地萎缩；时光从血管中偷饮生机，用熄灭恒星的灰烬染白我的须发。但在我讲述的那个年代，整个北极乐土找不出比我更勇猛刚毅的刽子手；我的名字如同血色警告，令森林与城镇的恶徒、蛮族强盗闻风丧胆。每日清晨，我身着猩红官袍立于广场中央，在众目睽睽下执行教化众生的职责。青铜弯刃总会在一天内多次浸透醇酒般的浓血。因我从不颤抖的手臂、万无一失的眼力与从不需要补刀的利落手法，罗夸梅斯罗王与科莫里奥姆民众对我敬重有加。\n\n我清楚记得关于逃犯克尼加辛·召姆的最早传闻——因其罪行远超寻常暴行。此人属于名为沃米斯的晦暗族群，栖居在距科莫里奥姆一日路程的黑色艾格洛菲安山脉，依照部落习俗占据比他们温顺的野兽洞穴。因浑身覆毛与亵渎神明的邪恶仪式，他们被视为更接近野兽的存在。恶名昭彰的克尼加辛·召姆正是从这些生物中招募党羽，在艾格洛菲安山麓犯下无数劫掠暴行。大规模抢劫仅是其最轻微的罪行；而食人癖好远非最恶劣之处。\n\n由此可见，沃米斯是保留着黑暗可憎血脉的原始种族。传言克尼加辛·召姆本人血统更为污浊，其母系与非人形神明撒托古亚存在亲缘——那位在亚人类纪元被广泛崇拜的异神。更有人低语他体内流淌着更诡异的体液（如果还能称之为血液），与随撒托古亚从外层空间降临的黑色不定形存在存在畸形联系。正因这种超宇宙血统混合，克尼加辛·召姆不似其他棕毛族人，而是通体无毛，皮肤布满黑黄斑块；其残暴狡诈更远胜同族。\n\n长久以来，这个可憎逃犯对我而言仅是个恐怖名号；但职业本能让我对他保持关注。许多人相信他刀枪不入，传说他以凡人无法理解的方式多次从坚不可摧的地牢逃脱。当然，我对这类传言嗤之以鼻——公职生涯中从未遇见过类似特质的罪犯。我深知庸众的迷信本性。\n\n随着职责履行，关于这个毒瘤的新报告每日不断。他不满足于山脉与周边丘陵的\"丰硕\"猎场，袭击范围日益扩大。终于某夜，他袭击了近乎科莫里奥姆郊区的村落。在司法人员赶到前，他与污秽同伙犯下难以言表的暴行，掳走村民退回水晶墙般的艾格洛菲安山巅洞穴。\n\n这次猖狂挑衅促使法律机器全力运转。此前地方官员的追捕转为科莫里奥姆警力的严密布控。陷阱遍布可能遭袭的城镇。然而克尼加辛·召姆仍月复一月地逃脱，频繁发动令人难堪的袭击。最终他在城郊大道被擒纯属偶然——或者源于其自身的鲁莽。出乎意料的是，这位以凶残著称的逃犯竟未作任何反抗。当被锁甲弓箭手与戟兵包围时，他即刻投降，嘴角挂着诡谲斜笑——那笑容此后多夜萦绕在场者的梦境。\n\n被捕时他诡异地形单影只，同伙无一落网。科莫里奥姆全城欢庆，人们争相目睹这个恐怖罪犯。我的兴趣尤甚——因为最终将由我亲手斩下克尼加辛·召姆的头颅。\n\n根据那些骇人传闻，我已预期将面对非同寻常的罪犯。但当我透过骚动人群望见狱车上的他时，克尼加辛·召姆仍远超最阴暗的想象。他裸露的上身仅裹着肮脏的黄色兽皮，膝盖以下尽是褴褛碎片。但这些细节远非最令人作呕之处。他看似具备原始人类的外形，但那种油腻的蠕动感，每个动作中流露的蜿蜒柔韧，暗示着某种低于人类——或说低于蛇类的无骨内在结构。他仿佛在滑行而非行走；关节位置看似随意拼凑。这具人形外壳像是向解剖学惯例做出的让步，随时可能显现出来自银河之外的畸形轮廓。此刻我完全相信关于他血统的骇人传说。带着同等恐惧与好奇，我揣测行刑时将见到何种恶臭黏液替代鲜血玷污公正之剑。\n\n克尼加辛·召姆的审判过程无需赘述。法律机器冷酷高效地运转，迅速判定其累累罪行。囚犯被关押在主地牢下的遗忘窖——在太古片麻岩中凿出的深井，仅靠绳索绞盘升降。井口压着巨石，十二名卫兵昼夜看守。但克尼加辛·召姆毫无逃脱意图，反常地顺从着即将到来的命运。对我这个总带有预言直觉的人而言，这种顺从充满不祥预兆。审判期间他的表现同样令我不安。自被捕起保持的沉默延续至法庭。尽管配备通晓艾格洛菲安方言的翻译，他对所有指控拒不回应。最令人不适的是他接受八位法官轮番宣判死刑，以及罗夸梅斯罗王最终确认时的坦然神态。此后我精心磨砺剑刃，决心以全部力量与技艺完成这场处决。\n\n鉴于克尼加辛·召姆的特异体质与罪行之恶，通常两周的行刑间隔被缩短至三日。指定之日清晨，经历整夜可怖梦境后，我准时来到精确位于广场中央的艾贡木砧前。琥珀色朝阳照耀着银袍官员、褐衣商贩与蛮族毛皮构成的喧嚣人群。\n\n克尼加辛·召姆在长戟与三叉戟的包围中出现。同时所有城门与广场入口都有重兵把守——当局担心亡命之徒会在最后时刻劫走首领。\n\n在卫兵警惕注视下，克尼加辛·召姆走向刑台，用没有眼睑的赭黄眼眸凝视我——近距离观察可见其中竟无瞳孔。他跪在木砧旁，斑驳的后颈不见丝毫颤抖。当我估算角度准备致命一击时，比以往更强烈地感受到他亵渎人形之下，那种令人作呕的可塑性，无脊椎的异界结构。更令人不安的是他全身散发的反常冷静，那种抽象而深不可测的漠然。他像条迟钝的巨蟒，对斩首斧毫无知觉。我意识到自己可能面对超出刽子手常规职责的异常，但仍以完美弧线挥下巨剑，施加全部力道。\n\n不同脖颈在利刃下的触感各异。这次的手感绝非任何已知生物组织。但欣慰的是斩击很成功：克尼加辛·召姆的头颅滚落多孔木砧，身躯瘫倒石板毫无抽搐。如我所料，没有鲜血——只有少量黑色焦油状恶臭分泌物，很快从剑刃与木砧上消失。解剖结构显示他缺乏正常脊椎。但表象上克尼加辛·召姆已毙命，法律判决得到精确执行。\n\n在群众欢呼中，我谦逊接受赞誉，监督尸体交由公共掘墓人处理——他们专司处置此类秽物。由于当日再无行刑，我返家休息。良心安宁，自认圆满完成了这项艰巨任务。\n\n依照处置极恶罪犯的惯例，克尼加辛·召姆被草草葬于城外的垃圾场，夹在两座粪堆间的无名浅坟。从罗夸梅斯罗王到受害村民，所有人都认为正义已获伸张。\n\n那夜享用完苏瓦纳果与琼瓜豆配富姆酒的盛宴后，我理应安眠。但如同前夜，我陷入一连串恶魔般的梦境。只记得其中弥漫着难以忍受的悬疑感，无名无形的恐怖不断累积，以及徒劳重复的黑暗折磨。还有拒绝具象化的记忆碎片——那些本不该被人类感知或思考的存在。醒来时疲惫不堪，将夜间的痛苦归咎于琼瓜豆。全然不知这些梦境即将显现其凶险预兆。\n\n现在我必须写下令地球与其居民战栗的事物；那些超越人类认知与自然法则，嘲弄空间维度，蔑视生物学的存在。这是个可怕的故事；纵使三十五年过去，古老的恐惧仍令执笔的手颤抖不已。\n\n但那天早晨我仍对此一无所知，正前往处决三名普通罪犯的刑场。刚出门就听见骚动席卷全城。愤怒、恐惧与哀嚎在街道间回荡。询问惊惶的市民后得知：克尼加辛·召姆回来了！他在主大道当众活吞了一名琼瓜豆商贩，对围观者的攻击毫不在意，直到餍足才任由警察带走。除却骨骸与衣物，受害者几乎没留下任何存在痕迹。由于没有法律先例，这个怪物再次被投入地牢，等候国王与八法官发落。\n\n可以想见我与科莫里奥姆民众及当局的极度窘迫。众人见证下，克尼加辛·召姆确实被依法斩首埋葬；他的复活不仅违背自然，更是对法律的嘲弄。为此特别通过法案，允许对\"从合法坟墓回归\"的恶徒进行再审与再处决。愚昧的市民已将此视为城邦灾祸的前兆。\n\n而我——拒绝超自然解释的理性思维——从他非地球的血统中寻找答案。确信这是外星生物学力量，某种星际生命物质的特性使然。\n\n以调查者精神，我召来埋葬他的掘墓人前往垃圾场。坟墓呈现诡异状态：除一端类似大型啮齿动物挖掘的深洞外，土壤未见扰动。任何人类体型（或至少人形）的生物都不可能通过此洞。当挖开掩埋物后，仅剩尸体曾停留处的粘稠痕迹与难以言喻的恶臭——后者很快消散在空气中。\n\n带着更深困惑（但仍相信存在合理解释），我等待二次审判。这次司法程序更为迅捷。判决新增埋葬条款：遗体需密封于坚固木棺，深埋石坑，覆以巨石。当局相信这能遏制这恶徒反常的复活倾向。\n\n当克尼加辛·召姆在加倍警力押送下再临刑场时，我带着更深忧虑与厌恶观察到他肉体的诡异变化：原本遍布全身的黑黄斑块重新分布；面部斑纹移位使表情更显狰狞；颈部明显缩短但无接合痕迹；肢体还有更微妙改变。不愿推测这些变化背后的机制，更不敢想象其持续发展的后果。我高举正义之剑，以英雄般的力道斩落。\n\n凡人肉眼所见，这次斩首同样成功。头颅滚落，躯干倒地。法律意义上，这个双重恶徒已双重死亡。\n\n然而这一次，我亲自监督了遗骸的处理过程，看着他们被安放进那具精致的阿尔法木棺椁，并用螺栓牢牢固定。随后我们将这具棺椁沉入十英尺深的墓穴，填入了精心挑选的巨石——即使最轻的巨石也需要三个壮汉才能抬起。所有人都觉得，这个无法无天的克尼加辛·召姆终于要永远安息了。\n\n唉！尘世的希望与努力何其虚妄！次日便传来了令人毛骨悚然、难以置信的暴行重演：那个诡异的半人形罪犯再度现身，科摩里奥姆城又有德高望重的居民沦为它食人欲望的牺牲品。这次被吞噬的竟是八位法官之一，这头怪物不仅啃光了这位肥胖法官的骨头，还把前来阻止它进食的警察脸上最突出的五官当作餐后甜点大快朵颐。如同前几次一样，这一切都在人群疯狂的抗议声中完成。当克尼加辛·召姆啃完那位不幸警官左耳仅存的残骸后，似乎终于感到餍足，竟又温顺地任由狱卒将它带走。\n\n听闻这个消息时，我和参与这次艰巨安葬工作的同伴们都惊骇至极。公众的反应更是令人忧心——迷信胆怯者纷纷逃离城市，被遗忘的预言再度流传，各教派祭司都在讨论如何用丰盛祭品安抚那些因神秘原因震怒的神明与偶像。虽然我对这类无稽之谈嗤之以鼻，但克尼加辛·召姆的持续复活确实令科学与宗教同样感到恐慌。\n\n我们例行检查了墓穴，发现部分压顶巨石以某种方式移位，形成的缝隙足以让一条巨蛇或麝鼠般体型的生物通过。金属螺栓固定的棺椁一端已然爆裂，想到需要何等恐怖的力量才能造成这种破坏，我们都不寒而栗。\n\n鉴于此事已超越所有已知生物学定律，民事法律程序被当即废止。太阳尚未升至天顶，我——阿萨玛斯就被紧急召见，受命立即对克尼加辛·召姆执行第三次斩首。遗骸的处置权完全交予我手，城中所有军警皆听我调遣。\n\n怀着被委以重任的觉悟，我虽困惑却毫不畏惧地前往刑场。当罪犯再度现身时，所有人都明显察觉到它的形体发生了骇人变异：斑驳体表浮现出令人作呕的诡异纹路，人类特征正被非人的扭曲所侵蚀。头颅几乎直接连接肩膀，斜凸凹陷的面部嵌着对角分布的眼睛，口鼻开始错位互换。更可怕的是它膝盖演化出的垂肉状结构，如同长满环纹的赘疣。但毋庸置疑，站在刑台前的（如果还能用\"站\"来形容）正是克尼加辛·召姆本尊。\n\n由于颈部几乎消失，第三次斩首需要精准到毫厘的手法——全城除我无人能胜任。值得欣慰的是，我的技艺完美完成了任务，再次斩落了那颗邪恶的头颅。只要刀刃稍有偏差，就会变成另一种形式的肢解。\n\n我和助手们以空前谨慎的态度处理了第三次安葬。我们将躯体封入青铜棺椁，头颅则放入另一具较小的青铜棺。焊死棺盖后，两具棺椁被分别运往科摩里奥姆城两端。装有躯体的棺椁深埋于巨石阵下，而头颅棺椁则留在郊外废弃宅邸的庭院中，由我与七名持戟卫士彻夜看守。我们还派重兵把守躯体埋葬处。\n\n夜幕降临后，我们带着大量火炬、深红福姆酒和猛犸象牙骰子来到庭院。火炬在石板上围成诡异的圆圈，我们一边漫不经心地监视棺椁，一边饮酒赌博。随着酒意渐浓，赌注越来越大，所有人都忘记了守夜的初衷。\n\n不知过了多久，一阵金属撞击的巨响将我们惊醒。只见那具儿童尺寸的棺椁正在火炬圈中疯狂跳动，像被无形之手抛掷般在花岗岩地面上铿锵翻滚。未等我们反应过来，棺椁表面开始诡异地膨胀变形，矩形轮廓逐渐扭曲成椭圆形。随着骇人的爆裂声，焊死的棺盖沿着接缝崩开，喷涌出沸腾的黑色物质——那团不可名状的东西翻涌着蛇毒般的泡沫，发出葡萄酒发酵的嘶嘶声，表面鼓起猪膀胱大小的烟灰色气泡。它扑灭数支火炬，如潮水般漫过石板，吓得我们踉跄后退。\n\n在摇曳的火光中，那团物质突然静止，如同地狱面团般开始收缩。最终它凝聚成黑色球体，表面浮现出模糊的五官轮廓——一只没有眼皮的琥珀色眼睛在球体中央瞪视着我们，瞳孔泛着磷光。静默一分钟后，它突然弹射而起，掠过我们头顶消失在午夜街道上。\n\n尽管惊魂未定，我们还是注意到它逃往了克尼加辛·召姆躯体埋葬的方向。带着满腹恐惧，我们借着酒劲抓起武器追去。深夜的街道空无一人，星光被瘟疫般的雾气遮蔽，脚步声在石板上回荡出墓穴般的空洞回响。\n\n在中央广场附近，我们遇到了看守躯体墓穴的卫兵。他们惊恐地描述墓穴如何发生地震般的震动，一条嘶嘶作响的巨蟒状物质如何破土而出。当我们交换情报后，所有人都意识到某种比野兽更邪恶的存在正在夜色中猎食。\n\n联合搜索毫无结果。黎明时分，我们听到广场方向传来撕心裂肺的惨叫。赶到正义之台时，两个路人正被难以形容的怪物纠缠——那分明是完成第三次融合的克尼加辛·召姆！它的头颅扁平地附着在胸腹之间，一只眼睛滑落至肚脐位置；双臂延长为触手，指节如纠缠的毒蛇；肩膀隆起形成杯状口器的锥形顶端；最骇人的是下肢——每个关节都分叉成长满吸盘的柔软长鼻。它正用多个口器同时吞噬那两个不幸者。\n\n闻声而来的人群爆发出歇斯底里的尖叫。我们试图围攻，却因怪物与受害者纠缠太紧而无从下手。当受害者被吸成干尸后，怪物突然退到刑台上开始膨胀——它以神话英雄都会战栗的速度增长，很快淹没了整个刑台。当它伸出巨蟒般的手臂缓缓探来时，连最勇敢的卫士都开始溃逃。城中居民如潮水般哭嚎着逃离，而我——阿萨玛斯，最终也不得不放弃这座失去国王、法律与人民的诅咒之城。"

        "title": "The Weird of Avoosl Wuthoqquan",
        "content": "\n\nI\n\n\"Give, give, O magnanimous and liberal lord of the poor,\" cried the beggar.\n\nAvoosl Wuthoqquan, the richest and most avaricious money-lender in all Commoriom, and, by that token, in the whole of Hyperborea, was startled from his train of reverie by the sharp, eerie, cicada-like voice. He eyed the supplicant with acidulous disfavor. His meditations, as he walked homeward that evening, had been splendidly replete with the shining of costly metals, with coins and ingots and gold-work and argentry, and the flaming or sparkling of many-tinted gems in rills, rivers and cascades, all flowing toward the coffers of Avoosl Wuthoqquan. Now the vision had flown; and this untimely and obstreporous voice was imploring for alms.\n\n\"I have nothing for you.\" His tones were like the grating of a shut clasp.\n\n\"Only two pazoors, O generous one, and I will prophesy.\"\n\nAvoosl Wuthoqquan gave the beggar a second glance He had never seen so disreputable a specimen of the mendicant class in all his wayfarings through Commoriom. The man was preposterously old, and his mummy-brown skin, wherever visible, was webbed with wrinkles that were like the heavy weaving of some giant jungle-spider. His rags were no less than fabulous; and the beard that hung down and mingled with them was hoary as the moss of a primeval juniper.\n\n\"I do not require your prophecies.\"\n\n\"One pazoor then.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nThe eyes of the beggar became evil and malignant in their hollow sockets, like the heads of two poisonous little pit-vipers in their holes.\n\n\"Then, O Avoosl Wuthoqquan,\" he hissed, \"I will prophesy gratis. Harken to your weird: the godless and exceeding love which you bear to all material things, and your lust therefor, shall lead you on a strange quest and bring you to a doom whereof the stars and the sun will alike be ignorant. The hidden opulence of earth shall allure you and ensnare you; and earth itself shall devour you at the last.\"\n\n\"Begone,\" said Avoosl Wuthoqquan. \"The weird is more than a trifle cryptic in its earlier clauses; and the final clause is somewhat platitudinous. I do not need a beggar to tell me the common fate of mortality.\"\n\nII\n\nIt was many moons later, in that year which became known to preglacial historians as the year of the Black Tiger.\n\nAvoosl Wuthoqquan sat in a lower chamber of his house, which was also his place of business. The room was obliquely shafted by the brief, aerial gold of the reddening sunset, which fell through a crystal window, lighting a serpentine line of irised sparks in the jewel-studded lamp that hung from copper chains, and touching to fiery life the tortuous threads of silver and similor in the dark arrases. Avoosl Wuthoqquan, seated in an umber shadow beyond the aisle of light, peered with an austere and ironic mien at his client, whose swarthy face and somber mantle were gilded by the passing glory.\n\nThe man was a stranger; possibly a travelling merchant from outland realms, the usurer thought—or else an outlander of more dubious occupation. His narrow, slanting, beryl-green eye, his bluish, unkempt beard, and the uncouth cut of his sad raiment, were sufficient proof of his alienage in Commoriom.\n\n\"Three hundred djals is a large sum,\" said the money-lender thoughtfully. \"Moreover, I do not know you. What security have you to offer?\"\n\nThe visitor produced from the bosom of his garment a small bag of tiger-skin, tied at the mouth with sinew, and opening the bag with a deft movement, poured on the table before Avoosl Wuthoqquan two uncut emeralds of immense size and flawless purity. They flamed at the heart with a cold and ice-green fire as they caught the slanting sunset; and a greedy spark was kindled in the eyes of the usurer. But he spoke coolly and indifferently.\n\n\"It may be that I can loan you one hundred and fifty djals. Emeralds are hard to dispose of; and if you should not return to claim the gems and pay me the money, I might have reason to repent my generosity. But I will take the hazard.\"\n\n\"The loan I ask is a mere tithe of their value,\" protested the stranger. \"Give me two hundred and fifty djals... There are other money-lenders in Commoriom, I am told.\"\n\n\"Two hundred djals is the most I can offer. It is true that the gems are not without value. But you may have stolen them. How am I to know? It is not my habit to ask indiscreet questions.\"\n\n\"Take them,\" said the stranger, hastily. He accepted the silver coins which Avoosl Wuthoqquan counted out, and offered no further protest. The usurer watched him with a sardonic smile as he departed, and drew his own inferences. He felt sure that the jewels had been stolen, but was in no wise perturbed or disquieted by this fact. No matter who they had belonged to, or what their history, they would form a welcome and valuable addition to the coffers of Avoosl Wuthoqquan. Even the smaller of the two emeralds would have been absurdly cheap at three hundred djals; but the usurer felt no apprehension that the stranger would return to claim them at any time... No, the man was plainly a thief, and had been glad to rid himself of the evidence of his guilt. As to the rightful ownership of the gems—that was hardly a matter to arouse the concern or the curiosity of the money-lender. They were his own property now, by virtue of the sum in silver which had tacitly been regarded by himself and the stranger as a price rather than a mere loan.\n\nThe sunset faded swiftly from the room, and a brown twilight began to dull the metal broideries of the curtains and the colored eyes of the gems. Avoosl Wuthoqquan lit the fretted lamp; and then, opening a small brazen strongbox, he poured from it a flashing rill of jewels on the table beside the emeralds. There were pale and ice-clear topazes from Mhu Thulan, and gorgeous crystals of tourmaline from Tscho Vulpanomi; there were chill and furtive sapphires of the north, and arctic carnelians like frozen blood, and diamonds that were hearted with white stars. Red, unblinking rubies glared from the coruscating pile, chatoyants shone like the eyes of tigers, garnets and alibraundines gave their somber flames to the lamplight amid the restless hues of opals. Also, there were other emeralds, but none so large and flawless as the two that he had acquired that evening.\n\nAvoosl Wuthoqquan sorted out the gems in gleaming rows and circles, as he had done so many times before; and he set apart all the emeralds with his new acquisitions at one end, like captains leading a file. He was well pleased with his bargain, well satisfied with his overflowing caskets. He regarded the jewels with an avaricious love, a miserly complacence; and one might have thought that his eyes were little beads of jasper, set in his leathery face as in the smoky parchment cover of some olden book of doubtful magic. Money and precious gems—these things alone, he thought, were immutable and non-volatile in a world of never-ceasing change and fugacity.\n\nHis reflections, at this point, were interrupted by a singular occurrence. Suddenly and without warning—for he had not touched or disturbed them in any manner—the two large emeralds started to roll away from their companions on the smooth, level table of black ogga-wood; and before the startled money-lender could put out his hand to stop them, they had vanished over the opposite edge and had fallen with a muffled rattling on the carpeted floor.\n\nSuch behavior was highly eccentric and peculiar, not to say unaccountable; but the usurer leapt to his feet with no other thought save to retrieve the jewels. He rounded the table in time to see that they had continued their mysterious rolling and were slipping through the outer door, which the stranger in departing had left slightly ajar. This door gave on a courtyard; and the courtyard, in turn, opened on the streets of Commoriom.\n\nAvoosl Wuthoqquan was deeply alarmed, but was more concerned by the prospect of losing the emeralds than by the eeriness and mystery of their departure. He gave chase with an agility of which few would have believed him capable, and throwing open the door, he saw the fugitive emeralds gliding with an uncanny smoothness and swiftness across the rough, irregular flags of the courtyard. The twilight was deepening to a nocturnal blue; but the jewels seemed to wink derisively with a strange phosphoric luster as he followed them. Clearly visible in the gloom, they passed through the unbarred gate that gave on a principal avenue, and disappeared.\n\nIt began to occur to Avoosl Wuthoqquan that the jewels were bewitched; but not even in the face of an unknown sorcery was he willing to relinquish anything for which he had paid the munificent sum of two hundred djals. He gained the open street with a running leap, and paused only to make sure of the direction in which his emeralds had gone.\n\nThe dim avenue was almost entirely deserted; for the worthy citizens of Commoriom, at that hour, were preoccupied with the consumption of their evening meal. The jewels, gaining momentum, and skimming the ground lightly in their flight, were speeding away on the left toward the less reputable suburbs and the wild, luxuriant jungle beyond. Avoosl Wuthoqquan saw that he must redouble his pursuit if he were to overtake them.\n\nPanting and wheezing valiantly with the unfamiliar exertion, he renewed the chase; but in spite of all his efforts, the jewels ran always at the same distance before him, with a maddening ease and eerie volitation, tinkling musically at whiles on the pavement. The frantic and bewildered usurer was soon out of breath; and being compelled to slacken his speed, he feared to lose sight of the eloping gems; but strangely, thereafterward, they ran with a slowness that corresponded to his own, maintaining ever the same interval.\n\nThe money-lender grew desperate. The flight of the emeralds was leading him into an outlying quarter of Commoriom where thieves and murderers and beggars dwelt. Here he met a few passers, all of dubious character, who stared in stupefaction at the fleeing stones, but made no effort to stop them. Then the foul tenements among which he ran became smaller, with wider spaces between; and soon there were only sparse huts, where furtive lights gleamed out in the full-grown darkness, beneath the lowering frondage of high palms.\n\nStill plainly visible, and shining with a mocking phosphorescence, the jewels fled before him on the dark road. It seemed to him, however, that he was gaining upon them a little. His flabby limbs and pursy body were faint with fatigue, and he was grievously winded, but he went on in renewed hope, gasping with eager avarice. A full moon, large and amber-tinted, rose beyond the jungle and began to light his way.\n\nCommoriom was far behind him now; and there were no more huts on the lonely forest road, nor any other wayfarers. He shivered a little—either with fear or the chill night air; but he did not relax his pursuit. He was closing in on the emeralds, very gradually but surely; and he felt that he would recapture them soon. So engrossed was he in the weird chase, with his eyes on the ever-rolling gems, that he failed to perceive he was no longer following an open highway. Somehow, somewhere, he had taken a narrow path that wound among monstrous trees whose foliage turned the moonlight to a mesh of quicksilver with heavy, fantastic raddlings of ebony. Crouching in grotesque menace, like giant retiarii, they seemed to close in upon him from all sides. But the money-lender was oblivious of their shadowy threats, and heeded not the sinister strangeness and solitude of the jungle path, nor the dank odors that lingered beneath the trees like unseen pools.\n\nNearer and nearer he came to the fleeting gems, till they ran and flickered tantalizingly a little beyond his reach, and seemed to look back at him like two greenish, glowing eyes, filled with allurement and mockery. Then, as he was about to fling himself forward in a last and supreme effort to secure them, they vanished abruptly from view, as if they had been swallowed by the forest shadows that lay like sable pythons athwart the moonlit way.\n\nBaffled and disconcerted, Avoosl Wuthoqquan paused and peered in bewilderment at the place where they had disappeared. He saw that the path ended in a cavern-mouth yawning blackly and silently before him, and leading to unknown subterranean depths. It was a doubtful and suspicious-looking cavern, fanged with sharp stones and bearded with queer grasses; and Avoosl Wuthoqquan, in his cooler moments, would have hesitated a long while before entering it. But just then he was capable of no other impulse than the fervor of the chase and the prompting of avarice.\n\nThe cavern that had swallowed his emeralds in a fashion so nefarious was a steep incline running swiftly down into darkness. It was low and narrow, and slippery with noisome oozings; but the money-lender was heartened as he went on by a glimpse of the glowing jewels, which seemed to float beneath him in the black air, as if to illuminate his way. The incline led to a level, winding passage, in which Avoosl Wuthoqquan began to overtake his elusive property once more; and hope flared high in his panting bosom.\n\nThe emeralds were almost within reach; then, with sleightful suddenness, they slipped from his ken beyond an abrupt angle of the passage; and following, he paused in wonder, as if halted by an irresistible hand. He was half blinded for some moments by the pale, mysterious, bluish light that poured from the roof and walls of the huge cavern into which he had emerged; and he was more than dazzled by the multi-tinted splendor that flamed and glowed and glistened and sparkled at his very feet.\n\nHe stood on a narrow ledge of stone; and the whole chamber before and beneath him, almost to the level of this ledge, was filled with jewels even as a granary is filled with grain! It was as if all the rubies, opals, beryls, diamonds, amethysts, emeralds, chrysolites, and sapphires of the world had been gathered together and poured into an immense pit. He thought that he saw his own emeralds, lying tranquilly and decorously in a nearer mound of the undulant mass; but there were so many others of like size and flawlessness that he could not be sure of them.\n\nFor a while, he could hardly believe the ineffable vision. Then, with a single cry of ecstasy, he leapt forward from the ledge, sinking almost to his knees in the shifting and tinkling and billowing gems. In great double handfuls, he lifted the flaming and scintillating stones and let them sift between his fingers, slowly and voluptuously, to fall with a light clash on the monstrous heap. Blinking joyously, he watched the royal lights and colors run in spreading or narrowing ripples; he saw them burn like steadfast coals and secret stars, or leap out in blazing eyes that seemed to catch fire from each other.\n\nIn his most audacious dreams, the usurer had never even suspected the existence of such riches. He babbled aloud in a rhapsody of delight, as he played with the numberless gems; and he failed to perceive that he was sinking deeper with every movement into the unfathomable pit. The jewels had risen above his knees, were engulfing his pudgy thighs, before his avaricious rapture was touched by any thought of peril.\n\nThen, startled by the realization that he was sinking into his newfound wealth as into some treacherous quicksand, he sought to extricate himself and return to the safety of the ledge. He floundered helplessly; for the moving gems gave way beneath him, and he made no progress but went deeper still, till the bright, unstable heap had risen to his waist.\n\nAvoosl Wuthoqquan began to feel a frantic terror amid the intolerable irony of his plight. He cried out; and as if in answer, there came a loud, unctuous, evil chuckle from the cavern behind him. Twisting his fat neck with painful effort, so that he could peer over his shoulder, he saw a most peculiar entity that was crouching on a sort of shelf above the pit of jewels. The entity was wholly and outrageously unhuman; and neither did it resemble any species of animal, or any known god or demon of Hyperborea. Its aspect was not such as to lessen the alarm and panic of the money-lender; for it was very large and pale and squat, with a toad-like face and a swollen, squidgy body and numerous cuttlefish limbs or appendages. It lay flat on the shelf, with its chinless head and long slit-like mouth overhanging the pit, and its cold, lidless eyes peering obliquely at Avoosl Wuthoqquan. The usurer was not reassured when it began to speak in a thick and loathsome voice, like the molten tallow of corpses dripping from a wizard's kettle.\n\n\"Ho! what have we here?\" it said. \"By the black altar of Tsathoggua, 'tis a fat money-lender, wallowing in my jewels like a lost pig in a quagmire!\"\n\n\"Help me!\" cried Avoosl Wuthoqquan. \"See you not that I am sinking?\"\n\nThe entity gave its oleaginous chuckle. \"Yes, I see your predicament, of course... What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"I came in search of my emeralds—two fine and flawless stones for which I have just paid the sum of two hundred djals.\"\n\n\"Your emeralds?\" said the entity. \"I fear that I must contradict you. The jewels are mine. They were stolen not long ago from this cavern, in which I have been wont to gather and guard my subterranean wealth for many ages. The thief was frightened away... when he saw me... and I suffered him to go. He had taken only the two emeralds; and I knew that they would return to me—as my jewels always return—whenever I choose to call them. The thief was lean and bony, and I did well to let him go; for now, in place, there is a plump and well-fed usurer.\"\n\nAvoosl Wuthoqquan, in his mounting terror, was barely able to comprehend the words or to grasp their implications. He had sunk slowly but steadily into the yielding pile; and green, yellow, red, and violet gems were blinking gorgeously about his bosom and sifting with a light tinkle beneath his armpits.\n\n\"Help! help!\" he wailed. \"I shall be engulfed!\"\n\nGrinning sardonically, and showing the cloven tip of a fat, white tongue, the singular entity slid from the shelf with boneless ease; and spreading its flat body on the pool of gems, into which it hardly sank, it slithered forward to a position from which it could reach the frantic usurer with its octopus-like members. It dragged him free with a single motion of incredible celerity. Then, without pause or preamble or further comment, in a leisurely and methodical manner, it began to devour him.",
        "content_cn": "一  \n\n\"施舍吧，施舍吧，哦，慷慨仁慈的贫民之主啊，\"乞丐嘶声喊道。  \n\n阿乌斯尔·乌索克万，科摩里奥姆最富有也最贪婪的放债人——因而也是整个希柏里尔最富有的守财奴——被这尖锐刺耳、如蝉鸣般的声音从遐想中惊醒。他用酸溜溜的厌恶眼神打量着这个乞讨者。方才他傍晚归家途中，满脑子还闪耀着贵重金属的光辉：钱币、金锭、黄金制品、银器，以及各色宝石汇成的溪流、江河与瀑布，全都奔涌向阿乌斯尔·乌索克万的金库。此刻幻象烟消云散，而这不合时宜的聒噪声音竟在乞求施舍。  \n\n\"我一文钱也不会给你。\"他的嗓音像生锈的锁扣般刺耳。  \n\n\"只要两枚帕祖尔，慷慨的老爷，我就为您预言吉凶。\"  \n\n阿乌斯尔·乌索克万再次瞥了乞丐一眼。他走遍科摩里奥姆的大街小巷，从未见过如此不堪的乞丐。这人老得离谱，裸露在外的木乃伊般的褐色皮肤上蛛网般的皱纹纵横交错，仿佛某种巨型丛林蜘蛛织就的厚重罗网。他的破衣烂衫简直匪夷所思，垂落其间、与之混为一体的胡须如同原始杜松上的苔藓般灰白。  \n\n\"我不需要你的预言。\"  \n\n\"那就一枚帕祖尔。\"  \n\n\"休想。\"  \n\n乞丐深陷眼窝中的双目突然变得恶毒而阴险，活像洞穴里两条剧毒的小蝮蛇头。  \n\n\"那么，阿乌斯尔·乌索克万，\"他嘶嘶地说道，\"我就免费为你预言。且听你的厄运：你对物质财富那渎神而极度的贪恋，将引领你踏上诡异的追寻之路，最终迎来连星辰与太阳都无从知晓的毁灭。大地深处埋藏的珍宝将引诱你、捕获你；而大地本身终将把你吞噬。\"  \n\n\"滚开，\"阿乌斯尔·乌索克万说，\"这预言的前半段晦涩得过分，结尾又陈词滥调。凡人的共同命运，还轮不到乞丐来告诉我。\"  \n\n二  \n\n数月之后，在那个被冰川期前历史学家称为黑虎之年的岁月里。  \n\n阿乌斯尔·乌索克万坐在宅邸底层——这里也是他处理业务的地方。斜阳短暂的金色余晖透过水晶窗射入房间，在悬挂于铜链上的宝石灯盏中折射出蛇虹般的火花，又将暗色挂毯上蜿蜒的银丝与金线点燃成炽烈的生命。放债人坐在光束之外的赭石色阴影里，以冷峻讥诮的神情打量着来客——那人黝黑的面孔与暗沉斗篷正沐浴着转瞬即逝的辉煌。  \n\n这是个陌生人；或许是来自异域的游商，高利贷者暗自揣度——抑或是行当更可疑的外乡人。那双狭长斜挑的绿玉色眼睛，蓝幽幽的凌乱胡须，以及粗陋的深色衣袍剪裁，无不彰显他在科摩里奥姆的异客身份。  \n\n\"三百迪亚尔可不是小数目，\"放债人若有所思道，\"况且你我素不相识。你有何抵押？\"  \n\n访客从衣襟内取出个虎皮小袋，袋口用兽筋扎紧。他灵巧地解开袋子，将两颗硕大无瑕的未切割祖母绿倾倒在阿乌斯尔·乌索克万面前的桌面上。宝石截住斜阳时，核心迸射出冰冷刺骨的翠绿火焰；放债人眼中立刻燃起贪婪的火花。但他开口时却冷静淡漠：  \n\n\"或许我能借你一百五十迪亚尔。祖母绿不易脱手；若你不来赎取，我恐怕要懊悔自己的慷慨。不过我愿意冒这个险。\"  \n\n\"我所求借款不过其价值的十分之一，\"陌生人抗辩道，\"给我二百五十迪亚尔吧……听说科摩里奥姆还有别的放债人。\"  \n\n\"最多二百迪亚尔。诚然这宝石并非毫无价值。但它们可能是你偷来的——我如何知晓？我一向不爱打听不该问的事。\"  \n\n\"成交。\"陌生人匆忙应允。他接过阿乌斯尔·乌索克万点出的银币，不再争辩。放债人目送他离去时露出讥讽的笑容，心中已有定论。他确信这些珠宝来路不正，却丝毫不以为意。无论它们曾属何人，有何来历，都将成为阿乌斯尔·乌索克万宝库中可喜的增值。即便较小的那颗祖母绿，以三百迪亚尔购得也简直便宜得可笑；但放债人毫不担心陌生人会回来赎取……不，这人显然是个窃贼，正急于脱手赃物。至于宝石的真正主人——这实在难以触动高利贷者的关切或好奇。既然双方心照不宣地将那笔银钱视为买卖而非借贷，此刻它们已是他的合法财产。  \n\n夕阳迅速从室内消退，褐色的暮色开始侵蚀帷幕上的金属刺绣与宝石的彩瞳。阿乌斯尔·乌索克万点亮雕花灯盏，随后打开青铜小保险箱，将一汪闪烁的宝石溪流倾泻在祖母绿旁的桌面上。来自穆·图兰的淡色冰透托帕石，采自乔·乌尔帕诺米的绚丽碧玺晶体，北方阴冷的蓝宝石，如冻血般的北极红玉髓，以及蕴含白色星芒的钻石。红宝石在璀璨的宝堆中不眨眼地怒视，猫眼石闪烁着虎睛般的光泽，石榴石与变石在变幻的蛋白石间向灯光投去幽暗的火焰。当然还有其他祖母绿，但无一能与今晚所得这两颗的尺寸与纯度媲美。  \n\n阿乌斯尔·乌索克万如往常般将宝石排列成闪亮的行列与圆圈，将新获祖母绿单独置于一端，宛如领队的将官。他对这笔交易心满意足，对满溢的珠宝箱志得意满。他以贪婪的爱意、守财奴的餍足凝视这些珍宝；此刻他镶嵌在皮革般面孔上的双眼，简直像某本可疑的古老魔法书熏黄的羊皮封面上嵌着的碧玉小珠。金钱与珍贵宝石——在这永恒变动无常的世界上，他想，唯有这些才是恒久不变的。  \n\n思绪在此被异象打断。毫无征兆地——他并未触碰或惊动它们——那两颗大祖母绿竟从乌木桌面上平稳滚离同伴；待震惊的放债人伸手阻拦时，它们已从对面桌缘坠落，在地毯上发出沉闷的咔嗒声。  \n\n此等行径诡异至极，简直匪夷所思；但高利贷者一跃而起，只想着追回珍宝。他绕过桌角时，恰见宝石继续神秘滚动，正滑过外门——方才陌生人离开时留了条缝隙。此门通向庭院，而庭院又连接着科摩里奥姆的街巷。  \n\n阿乌斯尔·乌索克万深感惊惶，但对遗失宝石的担忧压倒了对灵异事件的恐惧。他以令人难以置信的敏捷追了出去，推开门便看见那对逃逸的宝石正以诡异的流畅速度滑过庭院凹凸不平的石板。暮色已染上夜蓝，但每当他逼近，宝石便闪烁着嘲弄般的诡异磷光。它们清晰可辨地穿过未上锁的院门，消失在大道上。  \n\n阿乌斯尔·乌索克万开始怀疑宝石被施了魔法；但即便面对未知巫术，他也不愿放弃花费二百迪亚尔巨款购得之物。他箭步冲上街道，稍作停顿以确认祖母绿的逃窜方向。  \n\n昏暗的大道几乎空无一人；此刻可敬的科摩里奥姆市民们正忙于享用晚餐。那对宝石不断加速，轻掠地面向左飞行，直奔声名狼藉的郊区与远方狂野茂密的丛林。放债人明白必须加倍努力才能追上它们。  \n\n他不习惯如此剧烈运动，气喘吁吁却英勇地继续追赶；但任凭他如何努力，宝石总保持着恒定距离在前方飞舞，时而在人行道上奏出清脆乐音。惊慌困惑的高利贷者很快上气不接下气；正当他被迫减速、担心目标消失时，怪事发生了——此后宝石的滑行速度竟与他的步伐保持一致，永远维持着那段可望不可即的距离。\n\n那放债人愈发绝望。逃亡的祖母绿正将他引向科摩里奥姆城郊——盗匪、杀人犯与乞丐盘踞之地。途中偶遇的几个行人都面目可疑，他们呆望着飞窜的宝石却无人阻拦。污秽的棚屋渐渐稀疏，最终只剩零星茅舍蜷缩在参天棕榈的阴影下，几点诡谲灯火在浓稠黑暗中明灭。\n\n宝石始终在前方幽暗小径上磷光闪烁，仿佛嘲弄般引诱着他。尽管肥硕身躯已气喘吁吁，他仍感觉距离正在缩短。当琥珀色满月从丛林升起时，科摩里奥姆的灯火早已消失在身后。寒夜中他打着哆嗦，却未放缓脚步——祖母绿近在咫尺了。\n\n他全然没察觉自己已偏离大路。虬结古树将月光筛成水银蛛网，枝桠如角斗士般从四面逼来。但放债人只顾盯着前方跃动的绿光，对林间氤氲的腐臭与诡谲氛围浑然不觉。宝石始终与他保持一臂之距，最后竟像两只讥诮的绿眼睛般突然消失在道路尽头。\n\n阿沃斯尔·乌索克万愕然停步，发现小径尽头竟张着漆黑洞窟。若是平日，他绝不会踏入这长满獠牙般石笋的险恶之地，但此刻贪欲已吞噬理智。洞窟陡坡覆满粘液，深处却浮动着诱人绿光。当他跌跌撞撞冲下斜坡时，祖母绿总在转角处若即若离。\n\n转折突如其来。淡蓝幽光骤然倾泻而下，他僵立在石台上，被眼前景象震慑：整个地窟犹如装满谷粒的粮仓，只不过堆积如山的尽是红宝石、猫眼石、绿柱石、钻石、紫水晶、黄玉与蓝宝石！他的祖母绿或许就躺在最近的宝石丘上，但无数同等成色的珍宝已令人目眩神迷。\n\n放债人发出狂喜的嘶吼，纵身跃入珠宝之海。他掬起大把宝石任其从指间滑落，陶醉于璀璨光浪的起伏。当珠宝淹没大腿时，他才惊觉自己正像陷入流沙般下沉。挣扎反而加速了沉陷，转眼间七彩宝石已漫至腰间。\n\n\"救命！\"他尖叫着，洞窟深处随即传来油腻的嗤笑。回首只见一只苍白巨物蹲踞在壁龛上——那绝非世间任何生灵。它形如肿胀的蟾蜍，却生着章鱼般的触须，无睑的眼睛斜睨着垂死之人。\n\n\"哟，\"黏腻的声音如同熬煮尸油的声响，\"这不是个在宝石沼泽里打滚的肥放债人么？\"\n\n在阿沃斯尔语无伦次的求救声中，怪物慢条斯理地解释：这些珠宝自古属于它，被盗的祖母绿不过是它故意召回的诱饵。\"那小偷骨瘦如柴，\"它用触须轻易拽出深陷宝石的猎物，\"但阁下倒是......鲜嫩多汁。\"\n\n当七彩宝石漫过放债人脖颈时，怪物开始了它的饕餮盛宴。"

        "title": "Ubbo-Sathla",
        "content": "\n\nFor Ubbo-Sathla is the source and the end. Before the coming of Zhothaqquah or Yok-Zothoth or Kthulhut from the stars, Ubbo-Sathla dwelt in the steaming fens of the newmade Earth: a mass without head or members, spawning the grey, formless efts of the prime and the grisly prototypes of terrene life . . . And all earthly life, it is told, shall go back at last through the great circle of time to Ubbo-Sathla.\n\n—The Book of Eibon.\n\nPaul Tregardis found the milky crystal in a litter of oddments from many lands and eras. He had entered the shop of the curio-dealer through an aimless impulse, with no particular object in mind, other than the idle distraction of eyeing and fingering a miscellany of far-gathered things. Looking desultorily about, his attention had been drawn by a dull glimmering on one of the tables; and he had extricated the queer orb-like stone from its shadowy, crowded position between an ugly little Aztec idol, the fossil egg of a dinornis, and an obscene fetich of black wood from the Niger.\n\nThe thing was about the size of a small orange and was slightly flattened at the ends, like a planet at its poles. It puzzled Tregardis, for it was not like an ordinary crystal, being cloudy and changeable, with an intermittent glowing in its heart, as if it were alternately illumed and darkened from within. Holding it to the wintry window, he studied it for awhile without being able to determine the secret of this singular and regular alternation. His puzzlement was soon complicated by a dawning sense of vague and irrecognizable familiarity, as if he had seen the thing before under circumstances that were now wholly forgotten.\n\nHe appealed to the curio-dealer, a dwarfish Hebrew with an air of dusty antiquity, who gave the impression of being lost to commercial considerations in some web of cabbalistic revery.\n\n\"Can you tell me anything about this?\"\n\nThe dealer gave an indescribable, simultaneous shrug of his shoulders and his eye-brows.\n\n\"It is very old—palaeogean, one might say. I cannot tell you much, for little is known. A geologist found it in Greenland, beneath glacial ice, in the Miocene strata. Who knows? It may have belonged to some sorcerer of primeval Thule. Greenland was a warm, fertile region, beneath the sun of Miocene times. No doubt it is a magic crystal; and a man might behold strange visions in its heart, if he looked long enough.\"\n\nTregardis was quite startled; for the dealer's apparently fantastic suggestion had brought to mind his own delvings in a branch of obscure lore; and, in particular, had recalled The Book of Eibon, that strangest and rarest of occult forgotten volumes, which is said to have come down through a series of manifold translations from a prehistoric original written in the lost language of Hyperborea. Tregardis, with much difficulty, had obtained the medieval French version—a copy that had been owned by many generations of sorcerers and Satanists—but had never been able to find the Greek manuscript from which the version was derived.\n\nThe remote, fabulous original was supposed to have been the work of a great Hyperborean wizard, from whom it had taken its name. It was a collection of dark and baleful myths, of liturgies, rituals and incantations both evil and esoteric. Not without shudders, in the course of studies that the average person would have considered more than singular, Tregardis had collated the French volume with the frightful Necronomicon of the mad Arab, Abdul Alhazred. He had found many correspondences of the blackest and most appalling significance, together with much forbidden data that was either unknown to the Arab or omitted by him ... or by his translators.\n\nWas this what he had been trying to recall, Tregardis wondered? —the brief, casual reference, in The Book of Eibon, to a cloudy crystal that had been owned by the wizard Zon Mezzamalech, in Mhu Thulan? Of course, it was all too fantastic, too hypothetic, too incredible—but Mhu Thulan, that northern portion of ancient Hyperborea, was supposed to have corresponded roughly with Modem Greenland, which had formerly been joined as a peninsula to the main continent. Could the stone in his hand, by some fabulous fortuity, be the crystal of Zon Mezzamalech?\n\nTregardis smiled at himself with inward irony for even conceiving the absurd notion. Such things did not occur—at least, not in present-day London; and in all likelihood, The Book of Eibon was sheer superstitious fantasy, anyway. Nevertheless, there was something about the crystal that continued to tease and inveigle him. He ended by purchasing it, at a fairly moderate price. The sum was named by the seller and paid by the buyer without bargaining.\n\nWith the crystal in his pocket, Paul Tregardis hastened back to his lodgings instead of resuming his leisurely saunter. He installed the milky globe on his writing table, where it stood firmly enough on one of its oblate ends. Then, still smiling at his own absurdity, he took down the yellow parchment manuscript of The Book of Eibon from its place in a somewhat inclusive collection of recherché literature. He opened the vermiculated leather cover with hasps of tarnished steel, and read over to himself, translating from the archaic French as he read, the paragraph that referred to Zon Mezzamalech:\n\n\"This wizard, who was mighty among sorcerers, had found a cloudy stone, orb-like and somewhat flattened at the ends, in which he could behold many visions of the terrene past, even to the Earth's beginning, when Ubbo-Sathla, the unbegotten source, lay vast and swollen and yeasty amid the vaporing slime . . . But of that which he beheld, Zon Mezzamalech left little record; and people say that he vanished presently, in a way that is not known; and after him the cloudy crystal was lost.\"\n\nPaul Tregardis laid the manuscript aside. Again there was something that tantalized and beguiled him, like a lost dream or a memory forfeit to oblivion. Impelled by a feeling which he did not scrutinize or question, he sat down before the table and began to stare intently into the cold, nebulous orb. He felt an expectation which, somehow, was so familiar, so permeative a part of his consciousness, that he did not even name it to himself.\n\nMinute by minute he sat, and watched the alternate glimmering and fading of the mysterious light in the heart of the crystal. By imperceptible degrees, there stole upon him a sense of dreamlike duality, both in respect to his person and his surroundings. He was still Paul Tregardis—and yet he was someone else; the room was his London apartment—and a chamber in some foreign but well-known place. And in both milieus he peered steadfastly into the same crystal.\n\nAfter an interim, without surprise on the part of Tregardis, the process of re-identification became complete. He knew that he was Zon Mezzamalech, a sorcerer of Mhu Thulan, and a student of all lore anterior to his own epoch. Wise with dreadful secrets that were not known to Paul Tregardis, amateur of anthropology and the occult sciences in latter-day London, he sought by means of the milky crystal to attain an even older and more fearful knowledge.\n\nHe had acquired the stone in dubitable ways, from a more than sinister source. It was unique and without fellow in any land or time. In its depths, all former years, all things that have ever been, were supposedly mirrored, and would reveal themselves to the patient visionary. And through the crystal, Zon Mezzamalech had dreamt to recover the wisdom of the gods who died before the Earth was born. They had passed to the lightless void, leaving their lore inscribed upon tablets of ultra-stellar stone; and the tablets were guarded in the primal mire by the formless, idiotic demiurge, Ubbo-Sathla. Only by means of the crystal could he hope to find and read the tablets.\n\nFor the first time, he was making trial of the globe's reputed virtues. About him an ivory-panelled chamber, filled with his magic books and paraphernalia, was fading slowly from his consciousness. Before him, on a table of some dark Hyperborean wood that had been graven with grotesque ciphers, the crystal appeared to swell and deepen, and in its filmy depth he beheld a swift and broken swirling of dim scenes, fleeting like the bubbles of a millrace. As if he looked upon an actual world, cities, forests, mountains, seas and meadows flowed beneath him, lightening and darkening as with the passage of days and nights in some weirdly accelerated stream of time.\n\nZon Mezzamalech had forgotten Paul Tregardis—had lost the remembrance of his own entity and his own surroundings in Mhu Thulan. Moment by moment, the flowing vision in the crystal became more definite and distinct, and the orb itself deepened till he grew giddy, as if he were peering from an insecure height into some never-fathomed abyss. He knew that time was racing backward in the crystal, was unrolling for him the pageant of all past days; but a strange alarm had seized him, and he feared to gaze longer. Like one who has nearly fallen from a precipice, he caught himself with a violent start and drew back from the mystic orb.\n\nAgain, to his gaze, the enormous whirling world into which he had peered was a small and cloudy crystal on his rune-wrought table in Mhu Thulan. Then, by degrees, it seemed that the great room with sculptured panels of mammoth ivory was narrowing to another and dingier place; and Zon Mezzamalech, losing his preternatural wisdom and sorcerous power, went back by a weird regression into Paul Tregardis.\n\nAnd yet not wholly, it seemed, was he able to return. Tregardis, dazed and wondering, found himself before the writing table on which he had set the oblate sphere. He felt the confusion of one who has dreamt and has not yet fully awakened from the dream. The room puzzled him vaguely, as if something were wrong with its size and furnishings; and his remembrance of purchasing the crystal from a curio-dealer was oddly and discrepantly mingled with an impression that he had acquired it in a very different manner.\n\nHe felt that something very strange had happened to him when he peered into the crystal; but just what it was he could not seem to recollect. It had left him in the sort of psychic muddlement that follows a debauch of hashish. He assured himself that he was Paul Tregardis, that he lived on a certain street in London, that the year was 1932; but such common-place verities had somehow lost their meaning and their validity; and everything about him was shadow-like and insubstantial. The very walls seemed to waver like smoke; the people in the streets were phantoms of phantoms; and he himself was a lost shadow, a wandering echo of something long forgot.\n\nHe resolved that he would not repeat his experiment of crystal-gazing. The effects were too unpleasant and equivocal. But the very next day, by an unreasoning impulse to which he yielded almost mechanically, without reluctation, he found himself seated before the misty orb. Again he became the sorcerer Zon Mezzamalech in Mhu Thulan; again he dreamt to retrieve the wisdom of the antemundane gods; again he drew back from the deepening crystal with the terror of one who fears to fall; and once more—but doubtfully and dimly, like a failing wraith—he was Paul Tregardis.\n\nThree times did Tregardis repeat the experience on successive days; and each time his own person and the world about him became more tenuous and confused than before. His sensations were those of a dreamer who is on the verge of waking; and London itself was unreal as the lands that slip from the dreamer's ken, receding in filmy mist and cloudy light. Beyond it all, he felt the looming and crowding of vast imageries, alien but half-familiar. It was as if the phantasmagoria of time and space were dissolving about him, to reveal some veritable reality—or another dream of space and time.\n\nThere came, at last, the day when he sat down before the crystal—and did not return as Paul Tregardis. It was the day when Zon Mezzamalech, boldly disregarding certain evil and portentous warnings, resolved to overcome his curious fear of failing bodily into the visionary world that he beheld—a fear that had hitherto prevented him from following the backward stream of time for any distance. He must, he assured himself, conquer this fear if he were ever to see and read the lost tablets of the gods. He had beheld nothing more than a few fragments of the years of Mhu Thulan immediately posterior to the present-the years of his own life-time; and there were inestimable cycles between these years and the Beginning.\n\nAgain, to his gaze, the crystal deepened immeasurably, with scenes and happenings that flowed in a retrograde stream. Again the magic ciphers of the dark table faded from his ken, and the sorcerously carven walls of his chamber melted into less than dream. Once more he grew giddy with an awful vertigo as he bent above the swirling and milling of the terrible gulfs of time in the worldlike orb. Fearfully, in spite of his resolution, he would have drawn away; but he had looked and leaned too long. There was a sense of abysmal falling, a suction as of ineluctable winds, of maelstroms that bore him down through fleet unstable visions of his own past life into antenatal years and dimensions. He seemed to endure the pangs of an inverse dissolution; and then he was no longer Zon Mezzamalech, the wise and learned watcher of the crystal, but an actual part of the weirdly racing stream that ran back to re-attain the Beginning.\n\nHe seemed to live unnumbered lives, to die myriad deaths, forgetting each time the death and life that had gone before. He fought as a warrior in half-legendary battles; he was a child playing in the ruins of some olden city of Mhu Thulan; he was the king who had reigned when the city was in its prime, the prophet who had foretold its building and its doom. A woman, he wept for the bygone dead in necropoli long-crumbled; an antique wizard, he muttered the rude spells of earlier sorcery; a priest of some pre-human god, he wielded the sacrificial knife in cave-temples of pillared basalt. Life by life, era by era, he re-traced the long and groping cycles through which Hyperborea had risen from savagery to a high civilization.\n\nHe became a barbarian of some troglodytic tribe, fleeing from the slow, turreted ice of a former glacial age into lands illumed by the ruddy flare of perpetual volcanoes. Then, after incomputable years, he was no longer man, but a man-like beast, roving in forests of giant fern and calamite, or building an uncouth nest in the boughs of mighty cycads.\n\nThrough aeons of anterior sensation, of crude lust and hunger, of aboriginal terror and madness, there was someone—or something—that went ever backward in time. Death became birth, and birth was death. In a slow vision of reverse change, the earth appeared to melt away, and sloughed off the hills and mountains of its latter strata. Always the sun grew larger and hotter above the fuming swamps that teemed with a crasser life, with a more fulsome vegetation. And the thing that had been Paul Tregardis, that had been Zon Mezzamalech, was a part of all the monstrous devolution. It flew with the claw-tipped wings of a pterodactyl, it swam in tepid seas with the vast, winding bulk of an ichthyosaurus, it bellowed uncouthly with the armored throat of some forgotten behemoth to the huge moon that burned through primordial mists.\n\nAt length, after aeons of immemorial brutehood, it became one of the lost serpent-men who reared their cities of black gneiss and fought their venomous wars in the world's first continent. It walked undulously in ante-human streets, in strange crooked vaults; it peered at primeval stars from high, Babelian towers; it bowed with hissing litanies to great serpent-idols. Through years and ages of the ophidian era it returned, and was a thing that crawled in the ooze, that had not yet learned to think and dream and build. And the time came when there was no longer a continent, but only a vast, chaotic marsh, a sea of slime, without limit or horizon, without shore or elevation, that seethed with a blind writhing of amorphous vapors.\n\nThere, in the grey beginning of Earth, the formless mass that was Ubbo-Sathla reposed amid the slime and the vapors. Headless, without organs or members, it sloughed from its oozy sides, in a slow, ceaseless wave, the amoebic forms that were the archetypes of earthly life. Horrible it was, if there had been aught to apprehend the horror; and loathsome, if there had been any to feel loathing. About it, prone or tilted in the mire, there lay the mighty tablets of star-quarried stone that were writ with the inconceivable wisdom of the pre-mundane gods.\n\nAnd there, to the goal of a forgotten search, was drawn the thing that had been—or would sometime be—Paul Tregardis and Zon Mezzamalech. Becoming a shapeless eft of the prime, it crawled sluggishly and obliviously across the fallen tablets of the gods, and fought and ravened blindly with the other spawn of Ubbo-Sathla.\n\n* * *\n\nOf Zon Mezzamalech and his vanishing, there is no mention anywhere, save the brief passage in The Book of Eibon. Concerning Paul Tregardis, who also disappeared, there was a curt notice in several of the London papers. No one seems to have known anything about him: he is gone as if he had never been; and the crystal, presumably, is gone too. At least, no one has found it."

        "content": "\n\nTortha, the poet, with strange austral songs in his heart, and the umber of high and heavy suns on his face, had come back to his native city of Cerngoth, in Mhu Thulan, by the Hyperborean sea. Far had he wandered in the quest of that alien beauty which had fled always before him like the horizon. Beyond Commoriom of the white, numberless spires, and beyond the marsh-grown jungles to the south of Cornmoriom, he had floated on nameless rivers, and had crossed the half-legendary realm of Tscho Vulpanomi, upon whose diamond-sanded, ruby-graveled shore an ignescent ocean was said to beat forever with fiery spume.\n\nHe had beheld many marvels, and things incredible to relate: the uncouthly carven gods of the South, to whom blood was spilt on sun-approaching towers; the plumes of the huusim, which were many yards in length and were colored like pure flame; the mailed monsters of the austral swamps; the proud argosies of Mu and Antillia, which moved by enchantment, without oar or sail; the fuming peaks that were shaken perpetually by the struggles of imprisoned demons. But, walking at noon on the streets of Cerngoth, he met a stranger marvel than these. Idly, with no expectation of other than homely things, he beheld the White Sybil of Polarion.\n\nHe knew not whence she had come, but suddenly she was before him in the throng. Amid the tawny girls of Cerngoth with their russet hair and blue-black eyes, she was like an apparition descended from the moon. Goddess, ghost or woman, he knew not which, she passed fleetly and was gone: a creature of snow and norland light, with eyes like moon-pervaded pools, and lips that were smitten with the same pallor as the brow and bosom. Her gown was of some filmy white fabric, pure and ethereal as her person.\n\nIn wonder that turned to startled rapture, Tortha gazed at the miraculous being, and sustained for a moment the strangely thrilling light of her chill eyes, in which he seemed to find an obscure recognition, such as a long-veiled divinity, appearing at last, would vouchsafe to her worshipper.\n\nSomehow, she seemed to bring with her the infrangible solitude of remote places, the death-deep hush of lonely plateaus and mountains. A silence, such as might dwell in some abandoned city, fell on the chaffering, chattering crowd as she went by; and the people drew back from her in sudden awe. Before the silence could break into gossiping murmurs, Tortha had guessed her identity.\n\nHe knew that he had seen the White Sybil, that mysterious being who was rumored to come and go as if by some preterhuman agency in the cities of Hyperborea. No man had ever learned her name, or her nativity; but she was said to descend like a spirit from the bleak mountains to the north of Cerngoth; from the desert land of Polarion, where the oncoming glaciers crept in valleys that had once been fertile with fern and cycad, and passes that had been the highways of busy traffic.\n\nNo one had ever dared to accost or follow her. Often she came and went in silence; but sometimes, in the marts or public squares, she would utter cryptic prophecies and tidings of doom. In many places, throughout Mhu Thulan and central Hyperborea, she had foretold the enormous sheet of ice, now crawling gradually downward from the pole, that would cover the continent in ages to come, and would bury beneath oblivious drift the mammoth palms of its jungles and the superb pinnacles of its cities. And in great Commoriom, then the capital, she had prophecied a stranger doom that was to befall this city long before the encroachment of the ice. Men feared her everywhere, as a messenger of unknown outland gods, moving abroad in supernal bale and beauty.\n\nAll this, Tortha had heard many times; and he had wondered somewhat at the tale, but had soon dismissed it from his mind, being laden with marvelous memories of exotic things. But now that he had seen the Sybil, it was as if an unexpected revelation had been offered to him; as if he had discerned, briefly and afar, the hidden goal of a mystic pilgrimage.\n\nIn that single glimpse, he had found the personification of all the vague ideals and unfixed longings that had drawn him from land to land. Here was the eluding strangeness he had sought on alien breasts and waters, and beyond horizons of fire-vomiting mountains. Here was the veiled Star, whose name and luster he had never known. The moon-cold eyes of the Sybil had kindled a strange love in Tortha, to whom love had been, at most, no more than a passing agitation of the senses.\n\nHowever, on that occasion, it did not occur to him that he might follow the visitant or come to learn more concerning her. Momentarily, he was content with the rare vision that had fired his soul and dazzled his senses. Dreaming such dreams as the moon might inspire in a moth; dreams through which the Sybil moved like a woman-shaped flame on ways too far and too steep for human feet, he returned to his house in Cerngoth.\n\nThe days that ensued were dim and dream-like to Tortha, and were presided over by his memory of the white apparition. A mad Uranian fever mounted in his soul, together with the sure knowledge that he sought an impossible fruition. Idly, to beguile the hours, he copied the poems he had written during his journey, or turned over the pages of boyish manuscripts. All were equally void and without meaning now, like the sere leaves of a bygone year.\n\nWith no prompting on the part of Tortha, his servants and visitors spoke to him of the Sybil. Seldom, they said, had she entered Cerngoth, appearing more often in cities remote from the ice-bound waste of Polarion. Truly, she was no mortal being, for she had been seen on the same day in places hundreds of miles apart. Huntsmen had sometimes met her on the mountains above Cerngoth; but always, when encountered thus, she had disappeared quickly, like a morning vapor that melts among the crags.\n\nThe poet, listening with a moody and absent mien, spoke of his love to no one. He knew well that his kinsfolk and acquaintances would think this passion a more errant madness than the youthful yearning that had led him to unheard-of lands. No human lover had aspired to the Sybil, whose beauty was a perilous brightness, akin to meteor and fireball; a fatal and lethal beauty, born of transarctic gulfs, and somehow one with the far doom of worlds.\n\nLike the brand of frost or flame, her memory burned in Tortha. Musing among his neglected books, or walking abroad in reverie on which no outward thing could intrude, he saw always before him the pale radiance of the Sybil. He seemed to hear a whisper from boreal solitudes: a murmur of ethereal sweetness, sharp as ice-born air, vocal with high, unearthly words, that sang of inviolate horizons and the chill glory of lunar auroras above continents impregnable to man.\n\nThe long summer days went by, bringing the outland folk to trade their furs and eider in Cerngoth, and damaskeening the slopes beyond the city with flowers of bright azure and vermilion. But the Sybil was not seen again in Cerngoth, nor was she heard of in other cities. It seemed as if her visitations had ceased; as if, having delivered the tidings committed to her by the outer gods, she would appear no more in the haunts of mankind.\n\nAmid the despair that was twin to his passion, Tortha had nurtured a hope that he might again behold the visitant. Slowly the hope grew fainter; but left his longing undiminished. In his daily walks he now went farther afield, leaving the houses and streets and turning toward the mountains that glowered above Cerngoth, guarding with icy horns the glacier-taken plateau of Polarion.\n\nHigher he went each day on the hills, lifting his eyes to the dark crags from which the Sybil was rumored to descend. An obscure message seemed to call him on; and still, for a time, he did not dare to obey the summons wholly, but turned back to Cerngoth.\n\nThere came the forenoon when he climbed to a hill-meadow from which the roofs of the city were like littered shells beside a sea whose tumbling billows had become a smooth floor of turquoise. He was alone in a world of flowers: the frail mantle that summer had flung before the desolate peaks. The turf rolled away from him on every hand in broad scrolls and carpetries of flaming color. Even the wild briars had put forth their fragile, sanguine-tinted blossoms; and the very banks and precipices were heavily arrassed with low-hanging bloom.\n\nTortha had met no one; for he had long since left the trail by which the squat mountain people came to the city. A vague prompting, which seemed to include a promise unspoken by any voice, had led him to this lofty meadow from which a crystal rill ran seaward amid the bright cascades of flowers.\n\nPale, diaphanous beneath the sun, a few cirrous clouds went floating idly toward the pinnacles; and the quarrying hawks flew oceanward on broad red wings. A perfume, rich as temple-incense, rose from the blossoms whereon he had trampled; the light lay still and heavy upon him, dazzling his senses; and Tortha, a little weary from his climbing, grew faint for a moment with some strange vertigo.\n\nRecovering, he saw before him the White Sybil, who stood amid the flowers of blood-red and cerulean like a goddess of the snow attired in veils of moon-flame. Her pale eyes, pouring an icy rapture into his veins, regarded him enigmatically. With a gesture of her hand that was like the glimmering of light on inaccessible places, she beckoned him to follow, as she turned and went upward along the slope above the meadow.\n\nTortha had forgotten his fatigue; had forgotten all but the celestial beauty of the Sybil. He did not question the enchantment that claimed him, the wild Uranian ecstasy that rose in his heart. He knew only that she had reappeared to him, had beckoned him; and he followed.\n\nSoon the hills grew steeper against the overtowering crags; and barren ribs of rock emerged gloomily through the mantling flowerage. Without effort, light as a drifting vapor, the Sybil climbed on before Tortha. He could not approach her; and though the interval of distance between then increased at times, he did not altogether lose sight of her luminous figure.\n\nNow he was among bleak ravines and savage scarps, where the Sybil was like a swimming star in the chasmal, crag-flung shadows. The fierce mountain eagles screamed above him, eyeing his progress as they flew about their eyries. The chill trickle of rills born of the eternal glaciers fell upon him from overbeetling ledges; and sudden chasms yawned before his feet with a hollow roaring of vertiginous waters far below.\n\nTortha was conscious only of an emotion such as impels the moth to pursue a wandering flame. He did not picture to himself the aim and end of his pursuit, nor the fruition of the weird love that drew him on. Oblivious of mortal fatigue, of peril and disaster that might lie before him, he felt the delirium of a mad ascent to superhuman heights.\n\nAbove the wild ravines and escarpments, he came to a lofty pass that had led formerly between Mhu Thulan and Polarion. Here an olden highway, creviced and chasmed, and partly blocked with debris of avalanches and fallen watchtowers, ran between walls of winter-eaten rock. Down the pass, like some enormous dragon of glittering ice, there poured the vanguard of the boreal glaciers to meet the Sybil and Tortha.\n\nAmid the strange ardor of his ascent, the poet was aware of a sudden chill that had touched the noontide. The rays of the sun had grown dull and heatless; the shadows were like the depth of ice-hewn Arctic tombs. A film of ochreous cloud, moving with magical swiftness, swept athwart the day and darkened like a dusty web, till the sun glowed through it lifeless and pale as a moon in December. The heavens above and beyond the pass were closed in with curtains of leaden-threaded grey.\n\nInto the gathering dimness, over the glacier's machicolated ice, the Sybil sped like a flying fire, paler and more luminous against the somber cloud.\n\nNow Tortha had climbed the fretted incline of the ice that crawled out from Polarion. He had gained the summit of the pass and would soon reach the open plateau beyond. But like a storm raised up by preterhuman sorcery, the snow was upon him now in spectral swirls and blinding flurries. It came as with the ceaseless flight of soft wide wings, the measureless coiling of vague and pallid dragons.\n\nFor a time he still discerned the Sybil, as one sees the dim glowing of a sacred lamp through altar-curtains that descend in some great temple. Then the snow thickened, till he no longer saw the guiding gleam, and knew not if he still wandered through the walled pass, or was lost upon some bournless plain of perpetual winter.\n\nHe fought for breath in the storm-stifled air. The clear white fire that had sustained him seemed to sink and fall in his icy limbs. The unearthly fervor and exaltation died away, leaving a dark fatigue, an ever-spreading numbness that rose through all his being. The bright image of the Sybil was no more than a nameless star that fell with all else he had ever known or dreamed into grey forgetfulness....\n\nTortha opened his eyes to a strange world. Whether he had fallen and had died in the storm, or had stumbled on somehow through its white oblivion, he could not guess: but around him now there was no trace of the driving snow or the glacier-shackled mountains.\n\nHe stood in a valley that might have been the inmost heart of some boreal paradise-a valley that was surely no part of waste Polarion. About him the turf was piled with flowers that had the frail and pallid hues of a lunar rainbow. Their delicate forms were those of the blossoms of snow and frost, and it seemed that they would melt and vanish at a touch.\n\nThe sky above the valley was not the low-arching, tender turquoise heaven of Mhu Thulan, but was vague, dreamlike, remote, and full of an infinite violescence, like the welkin of a world beyond time and space. Everywhere there was light; but Tortha saw no sun in the cloudless vault. It was as if the sun, the moon, the stars, had been molten together ages ago and had dissolved into some ultimate, eternal luminescence.\n\nTall, slender trees, whose leafage of lunar green was thickly starred with blossoms delicate as those of the turf, grew in groves and clumps above the valley, and lined the margin of a stilly flowing stream that wound away into measureless misty perspectives.\n\nTortha noticed that he cast no shadow on the flowered ground. The trees likewise were shadowless, and were not reflected in the clear still waters. No wind lifted the blossom-heavy boughs, or stirred the countless petals amid the grass. A cryptic silence brooded over all things, like the hush of some supernal doom.\n\nFilled with a high wonder, but powerless to surmise the riddle of his situation, the poet turned as if at the bidding of an imperatory voice. Behind him, and near at hand, there was an arbor of flowering vines that had draped themselves from tree to tree. Through the half-parted arras of bloom, in the bower's heart, he saw like a drifted snow the white veils of the Sybil.\n\nWith timid steps, with eyes that faltered before her mystic beauty, and a flaming as of blown torches in his heart, he entered the arbor. From the bank of blossoms on which she reclined, the Sybil rose to receive her worshipper. . . .\n\nOf all that followed, much was forgotten afterwards by Tortha. It was like a light too radiant to be endured, a thought that eluded conception through surpassing strangeness. It was real beyond all that men deem reality: and yet it seemed to Tortha that he, the Sybil, and all that surrounded them, were part of an after-mirage on the deserts of time; that he was poised insecurely above life and death in some bright, fragile bower of dreams.\n\nHe thought that the Sybil greeted him in thrilling, mellifluous words of a tongue that he knew well, but had never heard. Her tones filled him with an ecstasy near to pain. He sat beside her on the faery bank, and she told him many things: divine, stupendous, perilous things; dire as the secret of life; sweet as the lore of oblivion; strange and immemorable as the lost knowledge of sleep. But she did not tell him her name, nor the secret of her essence; and still he knew not if she were ghost or woman, goddess or spirit.\n\nSomething there was in her speech of time and its mystery; something of that which lies forever beyond time; something of the grey shadow of doom that waits upon world and sun; something of love, that pursues an elusive, perishing fire; of death, the soil from which all flowers spring; of life, that is a mirage on the frozen void.\n\nFor a while Tortha was content merely to listen. A high rapture filled him, he felt the awe of a mortal in the presence of a deity. Then, as he grew accustomed to his situation, the woman-like beauty of the Sybil spoke to him no less eloquently than her words. Vacillant, by degrees, like a tide that lifts to some unearthly moon, there rose up in his heart the human love that was half of his adoration. He felt a delirium of desire, mixed with the vertigo of one who has climbed to an impossible height. He saw only the white loveliness of her divinity; and no longer did he hear clearly the high wisdom of her speech.\n\nThe Sybil paused in her ineffable discourse; and somehow, with slow, stumbling words, he dared to tell her of his love.\n\nShe made no answer, gave no gesture of assent or denial. But when he had done, she regarded him strangely; whether with love or pity, sadness or joy, he could not tell. Then, swiftly, she bent forward and kissed his brow with her pallid lips. Their kiss was like the searing of fire or ice. But, mad with his supreme longing, Tortha strove rashly to embrace the Sybil.\n\nDreadfully, unutterably, she seemed to change in his arms as he clasped her—to become a frozen corpse that had lain for ages in a floe-built tomb—a leper-white mummy in whose frosted eyes he read the horror of the ultimate void. Then she was a thing that had no form or name—a dark corruption that flowed and eddied in his arms—a hueless dust, a flight of gleaming atoms, that rose between his evaded fingers. Then there was nothing-and the faery-tinted flowers about him were changing also, were crumbling swiftly, were falling beneath flurries of white snow. The vast and violet heaven, the tall slim trees, the magic, unreflecting stream—the very ground under him—all had vanished amid the universal, whirling flakes.\n\nIt seemed to Tortha that he was plunging dizzily into some deep gulf together with that chaos of driven snows. Gradually, as he fell, the air grew clear about him, and he appeared to hang suspended above the receding, dissolving storm. He was alone in a still, funereal, starless heaven; and below, at an awesome and giddying distance, he saw the dimly glittering reaches of a land sheathed with glacial ice from horizon to far-curved horizon. The snows had vanished from the dead air; and a searing cold, like the breath of the infinite ether, was about Tortha.\n\nAll this he saw and felt for a timeless instant. Then, with the swiftness of a meteor, he resumed his fall toward the frozen continent. And like the rushing flame of a meteor, his consciousness dimmed and went out on the bleak air even as he fell.\n\nTortha had been seen by the half-savage people of the mountains as he disappeared in the sudden storm that had come mysteriously from Polarion. Later, when the blinding flurries had died down, they found him lying on the glacier. They tended him with rough care and uncouth skill, marvelling much at the white mark that had been imprinted like a fiery brand on his sun-swart brow. The flesh was seared deeply; and the mark was shaped like the pressure of lips. But they could not know that the never-fading mark had been left by the kiss of the White Sybil. Slowly, Tortha won back to some measure of his former strength. But ever afterward there was a cloudy dimness in his mind, a blur of unresolving shadow, like the dazzlement in eyes that have looked on some insupportable light.\n\nAmong those who tended him was a pale maiden, not uncomely; and Tortha took her for the Sybil in the darkness that had come upon him. The maiden's name was Illara, and Tortha loved her in his delusion; and, forgetful of his kin and his friends in Cerngoth, he dwelt with the mountain people thereafter, taking Illara to wife and making the songs of the little tribe. For the most part, he was happy in his belief that the Sybil had returned to him; and Illara, in her way, was content, being not the first of mortal women whose lover had remained faithful to a divine illusion.",
        "content_cn": "诗人托尔萨带着心中诡异的南方歌谣，面庞上烙着高原烈日晒出的赭色印记，终于回到了位于穆·苏兰、毗邻极北之海的故乡塞尔诺斯城。他曾在异域追寻那如地平线般永远逃遁的奇诡之美，足迹远至白塔林立的科摩里奥姆，更越过科摩里奥姆以南沼泽丛生的密林。他曾在无名河川上漂流，穿越半传说般的乔·乌尔帕诺米王国——据说那里的钻石沙滩与红宝石砾岸永远拍打着迸溅火星的怒涛，翻涌着烈焰般的浪沫。\n\n他目睹过诸多不可思议的奇观：南方那些粗陋雕琢的神像，在日晷高塔上享用血祭；如纯焰般艳丽的胡西姆鸟羽，足有数码之长；南方沼泽中身披鳞甲的怪物；姆大陆与安提利亚那些无需桨帆、凭魔法航行的骄傲商船；以及永远因囚禁恶魔的挣扎而喷吐浓烟的火山。但此刻正午时分，当他在塞尔诺斯街头漫步时，却遇见了比这些更离奇的景象。当他漫不经心、毫无期待地闲逛时，竟目睹了极光之地的白袍女先知。\n\n她出现得如此突兀，托尔萨无从知晓她的来处。在塞尔诺斯那些琥珀色肌肤、赤褐色头发与蓝黑眼眸的少女间，她宛如月宫降临的幽灵。女神、亡魂抑或凡人？未及分辨，这冰雪与极光凝成的造物已翩然远去——她眼眸如月光浸染的深潭，双唇与额头胸膛同样苍白，一袭薄纱白袍如她本人般空灵纯净。\n\n惊愕化作震颤的狂喜，托尔萨凝视着这奇迹般的存在，短暂承接了她冰冷眼眸中令人战栗的微光。那目光里似有某种晦涩的认可，如同长久隐匿的神明终于向信徒展露真容。\n\n她周身萦绕着荒远之地不可侵犯的孤寂，死一般沉寂的孤峰气息。当她经过时，喧嚣市集突然陷入废弃古城般的静默，人群敬畏地退避。未等窃窃私语再度响起，托尔萨已猜出她的身份。\n\n他确信自己遇见了传说中的白袍女先知——那个据闻以非人方式出入极北诸城的神秘存在。无人知晓她的名讳与来历，只传说她如精灵般自塞尔诺斯以北的荒山降临，来自那片正被冰川吞噬的极光之地。那里曾有蕨类与苏铁繁茂的山谷，如今却成了冰河蔓延的通道。\n\n从无人敢上前搭话或尾随。她常沉默来去，但偶尔会在市集预言灾厄。在整个穆·苏兰与极北腹地，她预言过来自极地的巨型冰盖将吞噬大陆，掩埋丛林中的巨蕨与都市尖塔。而在都城大科摩里奥姆，她更预言过比冰河更早降临的诡异末日。人们视她为异域神祇的信使，畏惧她超凡的美丽与灾厄。\n\n这些传说托尔萨早有耳闻，却因满载异域奇观而未曾在意。但此刻亲眼所见，恍若揭开了神秘朝圣之旅的终极真相。在这惊鸿一瞥中，他找到了所有驱使他漂泊的朦胧理想之化身。这正是他穿越喷火山脉、跨越异域海疆所追寻的 elusive strangeness（难以捉摸的异质之美），正是那轮从未知其名的隐曜星辰。女先知月华般冰冷的眼眸，在托尔萨心中点燃了前所未有的爱火——对他而言，爱曾不过是感官的短暂悸动。\n\n然而此刻他并未兴起追随的念头。那惊鸿一瞥已足够点燃他的灵魂。他如飞蛾耽于月光般做着幻梦，梦见女先知化作人形火焰，行经凡人不可企及的险径，恍惚间回到了塞尔诺斯的居所。\n\n此后数日如朦胧梦境，白色幻影始终盘踞心头。一种天界狂热在他血液里沸腾，同时清醒意识到这是徒劳的渴望。为消磨时光，他誊抄旅途诗稿，翻阅少年手稿，如今这些都如枯叶般空洞无味。\n\n无需托尔萨探问，仆役访客便主动谈及女先知。据说她极少造访塞尔诺斯，更多出现在远离极光之冰原的城邦。猎人们曾在山上遇见她，但总如晨雾消散于巉岩之间。\n\n诗人阴郁沉默，绝口不提爱慕。他深知族人会视这种激情比年少远游更疯癫。从无凡人敢爱慕女先知——她的美是流星与火球般的致命光辉，诞生自极北深渊，与世界的终极末日相连。\n\n如冰火烙印，她的幻影灼烧着托尔萨。无论埋首书卷或漫步沉思，苍白光芒总浮现在眼前。他仿佛听见北方荒原的私语：凛冽如冰风的呢喃，吟唱着人类无法触及的疆域与极光之辉。\n\n漫长夏日流逝，外邦人带着毛皮与绒羽来塞尔诺斯交易，城外山坡铺满青金石与朱砂色的花海。但女先知再未现身，仿佛已完成神谕使命，永离人间。\n\n在绝望与渴望交织中，托尔萨开始向城外群山漫游，每日攀登更高处，眺望传说中女先知降临的黑色巉岩。某种晦涩召唤驱使着他，却始终未敢彻底响应。\n\n某个清晨，他来到可俯瞰全城的山间草甸。在这片被夏花暂时遮掩荒凉的花毯上，他独自行走。野蔷薇绽放血色花朵，悬崖垂挂花瀑。阳光沉重地笼罩着他，令他因某种奇异眩晕而恍惚。\n\n苏醒时，白袍女先知正立于血红与蔚蓝的花丛中，如披覆月焰薄纱的雪之女神。她苍白眼眸注入他血管冰凉的狂喜，以如照 inaccessible places（遥不可及之境）的微光般的手势，引他随行上山。\n\n托尔萨忘却疲惫，唯追随着那道 celestial beauty（天界之美）。山势渐陡，裸岩刺破花毯。女先知如飘雾般轻盈攀登，始终与他保持距离。\n\n此刻他置身荒凉峡谷，女先知如幽壑间游弋的星辰。山鹰在巢穴上空盘旋尖啸，永恒冰川融化的冰溪从悬岩滴落，脚下突然裂开深渊，传来令人眩晕的激流轰鸣。\n\n托尔萨如飞蛾逐火，不思归途。越过蛮荒峡谷，他来到昔日连接穆·苏兰与极光之地的古老隘口。这里残存着被雪崩与瞭望塔废墟阻塞的古道，而冰川先锋正如闪耀冰龙般向二人涌来。\n\n正午突然转寒，太阳黯淡如十二月残月。赭色云幔魔幻般遮蔽天穹，女先知在铅灰色云幕前化作苍白的飞焰。\n\n当托尔萨攀上冰原边缘时，暴雪如超凡巫术召唤的军团降临。起初他还能透过雪幕望见女先知如圣坛灯焰般的微光，很快便彻底迷失方向，不知自己仍在隘口，还是陷入了永冬的无垠荒原。\n\n他在暴风雪窒息的空气中挣扎呼吸。那曾支撑着他的纯净白焰，此刻在他冰封的肢体间沉沦熄灭。非人的狂热与昂扬逐渐消退，只余下幽暗的疲惫，一种蔓延全身的麻木。女祭司的璀璨形象已化作无名流星，与他所知所梦的一切坠入灰暗的遗忘深渊......\n\n托萨睁眼面对陌生世界。他无从判断自己是否已在暴风雪中倒下身亡，抑或踉跄穿越了那片白色混沌：此刻周遭既无狂舞的雪沫，亦无冰封的群山。\n\n他伫立的峡谷恍若北方乐土最隐秘的核心——这绝非极地荒原的组成部分。苔原上堆叠着月虹般脆弱的苍白花朵，其精致形态宛如冰雪雕琢的结晶，仿佛触碰即会消融。\n\n峡谷上方的天空并非姆·图兰低垂的柔绿苍穹，而是朦胧如梦、遥不可及，浸透着无限紫晕，宛若超脱时空的异界天幕。光明无处不在，但万里晴空中托萨未见日轮踪迹，仿佛日月星辰早在远古熔融，化作了某种终极的永恒辉光。\n\n修长的树木生着月绿色叶丛，其间缀满与苔原同样纤弱的花朵，它们丛生于峡谷高处，沿着蜿蜒入雾霭的静流两岸排列成行。\n\n托萨察觉自己未在花地上投下阴影。树木同样无影无形，澄澈水面上亦无倒影。繁花压枝的枝条纹丝不动，草间无数花瓣静止如凝固。玄奥的寂静笼罩万物，如同某种至高厄运降临前的死寂。\n\n怀着崇高惊异却无力揣测自身处境之谜，诗人如奉神谕般转身。身后近处有座藤蔓交织的凉亭，繁花垂帘半启处，女祭司的白纱如飘雪般朦胧可见。\n\n他踏着怯步走进凉亭，双眼在她神秘的美貌前震颤，心中火炬般炽燃。女祭司从花榻起身相迎......\n\n此后种种，托萨多已遗忘。那光芒过于炫目，那意念因极度诡奇而难以捕捉。其真实超越人类认知的极限：然而托萨恍惚觉得，自己、女祭司与周遭一切，不过是时间荒漠上的蜃景，他正悬于生死之间某个明亮脆弱的梦境凉亭。\n\n他以为女祭司用某种熟知却未闻的语言致以颤动人心的问候。她的音调令他近乎痛苦的狂喜。他坐在她身旁的仙榻上，听她讲述诸多神异可怖之事：如生命之谜般骇人，如遗忘学识般甜美，如沉睡秘辛般古老而不可追忆。但她未透露真名与本质，他仍不知她是幽魂还是凡女，神明还是精魅。\n\n她话语间涉及时间之谜，涉及永恒超脱时空之物，涉及笼罩世界与太阳的灰色厄运阴影，涉及追逐幻灭之火的爱恋，涉及孕育万花的死亡土壤，涉及冰寂虚空中浮动的生命蜃景。\n\n托萨一度满足于静听。神圣狂喜充斥身心，他感受着凡人对神祇的敬畏。待渐渐适应处境后，女祭司如凡女般的美貌与言语同样摄人心魄。犹豫渐消，如潮汐受异月牵引，他心中升腾起掺杂爱慕的凡俗情欲。欲望的谵妄与攀临绝巅的眩晕交织，他眼中只剩神性之白美，耳中再难辨其智慧箴言。\n\n女祭司停下玄奥之语时，他竟以笨拙言辞贸然吐露爱意。\n\n她未置可否，只是投来难以解读的目光——爱怜或悲悯，哀伤或欢欣，他无从分辨。倏忽间她俯身以苍白双唇烙下额吻。那接触如冰火灼烧。但被终极渴望逼疯的托萨，竟鲁莽地试图拥抱女祭司。\n\n可怕的变化在他臂弯间发生——她化作冰封万古的浮冰墓尸，化作霜目凝望终极虚空的惨白木乃伊，继而成为无状无名的黑暗腐流，最终散作掠过指隙的灰烬。凉亭周围仙花也开始凋零，在突如其来的雪暴中崩塌。\n\n托萨仿佛与雪暴共同坠入深渊。下坠间空气渐澄明，他悬浮于消散的风暴之上，独处于死寂无星的幽冥天幕中。下方遥不可及的冰封大地正泛着微光。雪沫从死寂中消失，宇宙以太般的刺骨严寒包裹着他。\n\n这景象持续了超越时间的刹那。随后他如流星般坠向冰原，意识在凄厉寒风中与坠落同步熄灭。\n\n当托萨消失在神秘袭来的极地暴风雪中时，半开化的山民目睹了这一幕。待雪暴平息，他们在冰川上发现了昏迷的他。人们以粗粝医术施救，对他晒黑额头上如火烙般的白色印记惊诧不已——那是永不消退的唇形灼痕，却无人知晓此乃白女祭司之吻所遗。\n\n托萨逐渐恢复些许气力，但心智始终笼罩着迷雾般的阴翳，如同直视不可承受之光后的眩盲。照料者中有位名唤伊菈拉的苍白少女，心智混沌的托萨误认其为女祭司。他忘却故土亲友，与山民同居并娶伊菈拉为妻，为部落创作歌谣。他大多时候沉醉于女祭司归来的幻梦，而伊菈拉亦安于这般境遇——她并非首位爱人忠于神性幻影的凡间女子。"

        "content": "\n\nQuanga the huntsman, with Hoom Feethos and Eibur Tsanth, two of the most enterprising jewelers of Iqqua, had crossed the borders of a region into which men went but seldom — and wherefrom they returned even more rarely. Travelling north from Iqqua, they had passed into desolate Mhu Thulan, where the great glacier of Polarion had rolled like a frozen sea upon wealthy and far-famed cities, covering the broad isthmus from shore to shore beneath fathoms of perpetual ice.\n\nThe shell-shaped domes of Cerngoth, it was fabled, could still be seen deep down in the glaciation; and the high, keen spires of Oggon-Zhai were embedded therein, together with fern-palm and mammoth and the square black temples of the god Tsathoggua. All this had occurred many centuries ago; and still the ice, a mighty, glittering rampart, was moving south upon deserted lands.\n\nNow, in the path of the embattled glacier, Quanga led his companions on a bold quest. Their object was nothing less than the retrieval of the rubies of King Haalor, who, with the wizard Ommum-Vog and many full-caparisoned soldiers, had gone out five decades before to make war upon the polar ice. From this fantastic expedition, neither Haalor nor OmmumVog had come back; and the sorry, ragged remnant of their men-at-arms, returning to Iqqua, after two moons, had told a dire tale.\n\nThe army, they said, had made its encampment on a sort of knoll, carefully chosen by Ommum-Vog, in full sight of the vanward ice. Then the mighty sorcerer, standing with Haalor amid a ring of braziers that fumed incessantly with golden smoke, and reciting runes that were older than the world, had conjured up a fiery orb, vaster and redder than the southwardcircling sun of heaven. And the orb, with blazing beams that smote from the zenith, torrid and effulgent, had caused the sun to seem no more than a daylight moon, and the soldiers had almost swooned from its heat in their heavy panoply. But beneath its beams the verges of the glacier melted and ran in swift rills and rivers, so that Haalor for a time was hopeful of reconquering the realm of Mhu Thulan over which his forefathers had ruled in bygone ages.\n\nThe rushing waters had deepened, flowing past the knoll on which the army waited. Then, as if by a hostile magic, the rivers began to give forth a pale and stifling mist, that blinded the conjured sun of Ommum-Vog, so that its sultry beams grew faint and chill and had power no longer on the ice.\n\nVainly the wizard had put forth other spells, trying to dissipate the deep and gelid fog. But the vapor drew down, evil and clammy, coiling and wreathing like knots of phantom serpents, and filling nen's marrows as if with the cold of death. It covered all the camp, a tangible thing, ever colder and thicker, numbing the limbs of those who groped blindly and could not see the faces of their fellows at arm's-length. A few of the common soldiers, somehow, reached its outer confines and crept fearfully away beneath the wan sun, seeing no longer in the skies the wizard globe that had been called up by Ommum-Vog. And looking back presently, as they fled in strange terror, they beheld, instead of the low-lying mist they had thought to see, a newly frozen sheet of ice that covered the mound on which the king and the sorcerer had made their encampment. The ice rose higher above the ground than a tall man's head; and dimly, in its glittering depth, the fleeing soldiers saw the imprisoned forms of their leaders and companions.\n\nDeeming that this thing was no natural occurrence, but a sorcery that had been exerted by the great glacier, and that the glacier itself was a live, malignant entity with powers of unknown bale, they did not slacken their flight. And the ice had suffered them to depart in peace, as if to give warning of the fate of those who dared to assail it.\n\nSome there were who believed the tale, and some who doubted. But the kings that ruled in Iqqua after Haalor went not forth to do battle with the ice; and no wizard rose to make war upon it with conjured suns. Men fled before the everadvancing glaciations; and strange legends were told of how people had been overtaken or cut off in lonely valleys by sudden, diabolic shiftings of the ice, as if it had stretched out a living hand. And legends there were, of awful crevasses that yawned abruptly and closed like monstrous mouths upon them that dared the frozen waste; of winds like the breath of boreal demons, that blasted men's flesh with instant, utter cold and turned them into statues hard as granite. In time the whole region, for many miles before the glacier, was generally shunned; and only the hardiest hunters would follow their quarry into the winter-blighted land.\n\nNow it happened that the fearless huntsman Iluac, the elder brother of Quanga, had gone into Mhu Thulan, and had pursued an enormous black fox that led him afar on the mighty fields of the ice-sheet. For many leagues he trailed it, coming never within bowshot of the beast; and at length he came to a great mound on the plain, that seemed to mark the position of a buried hill. And Iluac thought that the fox entered a cavern in the mound; so, with lifted bow and a poised arrow at the string, he went after it into the cavern.\n\nThe place was like a chamber of boreal kings or gods. All about him, in a dim green light, were huge, glimmering pillars; and giant icicles hung from the roof in the forrn of stalactites. The floor sloped downward; and Iluac came to the cave's end without finding any trace of the fox. But in the transparent depth of the further wall, at the bottom, he saw the standing shapes of many men, deep-frozen and sealed up as in a tomb, with undecaying bodies and fair, unshrunken features. The men were armed with tall spears, and most of them wore the panoply of soldiers. But among them, in the van, there stood a haughty figure attired in the sea-blue robes of a king; and beside him was a bowed ancient who wore the night-black garb of a sorcerer. The robes of the regal figure were heavily sewn with gems that burned like colored stars through the ice; and great rubies red as gouts of newly congealing blood were arranged in the lines of a triangle on the bosom, forming the royal sign of the kings of Iqqua. So Iluac knew, by these tokens, that he had found the tomb of Haalor and OmmumVog and the soldiers with whom they had gone up against the ice in former days.\n\nOverawed by the strangeness of it all, and remembering now the old legends, Iluac lost his courage for the first time, and quitted the chamber without delay. Nowhere could he find the black fox; and abandoning the chase, he returned southward, reaching the lands below the glacier without mishap. But he swore later that the ice had changed in a weird maoner while he was following the fox, so that he was unsure of his direction for a while after leaving the cavern. There were steep ridges and hummocks where none had been before, making his return a toilsome journey; and the glaciation seemed to extend itself for many miles beyond its former limits. And because of these things, which he could not explain or understand, a curious eery fear was born in the heart of Iluac.\n\nNever again did he go back upon the glacier; but he told his brother Quanga of that which he had found, and described the location of the cavern-chamber in which King Haalor and Ommum-Vog and their men-at-arms were entombed. And soon after this, Iluac was killed by a white bear on which he had used all his arrows in vain.\n\nQuanga was no less brave than Iluac; and he did not fear the glacier, since he had been upon it many times and had noticed nothing untoward. His was a heart that lusted after gain, and often he thought of the rubies of Haalor, locked with the king in eternal ice; and it seemed to him that a bold man might recover the rubies.\n\nSo, one summer, while trading in Iqqua with his furs, he went to the jewelers Bibur Tsanth and Hoom Feethos, taking with him a few garnets that he had found in a northern valley. While the jewelers were appraising the garnets, he spoke idly of the rubies of Haalor, and inquired craftily as to their value. Then, hearing the great worth of the gems, aod noting the greedy interest that was shown by Hoom Feethos and Eibur Tsanth, he told them the tale he had heard from his brother Iluac, and offered, if they would promise him half the value of the rubies, to guide them to the hidden cave.\n\nThe jewelers agreed to this proposition, in spite of the hardships of the proposed journey, and the difficulty they might afterward encounter in disposing surreptitiously of gems that belonged to the royal family of Iqqua and would be claimed by the present king, Ralour, if their discovery were learned. The fabulous worth of the rubies had fired their avarice. Quanga, on his part, desired the complicity and connivance of the dealers, knowing that it would be hard for him to sell the jewels otherwise. He did not trust Hoom Feethos and Eibur Tsanth, and it was for this reason that he required them to go with him to the cavern and pay over to him the agreed sum of money as soon as they were in possession of the treasure.\n\nThe strange trio had set forth in mid-summer. Now, after two weeks of journeying through a wild, sub-arctic region, they were approaching the confines of the eternal ice. They travelled on foot, and their supplies were carried by three horses little larger than musk-oxen. Quanga, an unerring marksman, hunted for their daily food the hares and waterfowl of the country.\n\nBehind thern, in a cloudless turquoise heaven, there burned the low sun that was said to have described a loftier ecliptic in former ages. Drifts of unmelting snow were heaped in the shadows of the higher hills; and in steep valleys they came upon the vanward glaciers of the ice-sheet. The trees and shrubs were already sparse and stunted, in a land where rich forests had flourished in olden time beneath a milder climate. But poppies flamed in the meadows and along the slopes, spreading their frail beauty like a scarlet rug before the feet of perennial winter; and the quiet pools and stagnant-flowing streams were lined with white water-lilies.\n\nA little to the east, they saw the fuming of volcanic peaks that still resisted the inroads of the glaciers. On the west were high, gaunt mountains whose sheer cliffs and pinnacles were topped with snow, and around those nether slopes the ice had climbed like an inundating sea. Before them was the looming, crenelated wall oE the realm-wide glaciation, moving equally on plain and hill, uprooting the trees, and pressing the soil forward in vast folds and ridges. Its progress had been stayed a little by the northern summer. Quanga and the jewelers, as they went on, came to turbid rills, made by a temporary melting, that issued from beneath the glittering blue-green ramparts.\n\nThey left their pack-horses in a grassy valley, tethered by long cords of elf-thong to the dwarfish willows. Then, carrying such provisions and other equipment as they might require for a two days' journey, they climbed the ice-slope at a point selected by Quanga as being most readily accessible, and started in the direction of the cave that had been found by Iluac. Quanga took his bearings from the position of the volcanic mountains, and also from two isolated peaks that rose on the sheeted plain to the north like the breasts of a giantess beneath her shining armor.\n\nThe three were well equipped for all the exigencies of their search. Quanga carried a curious pick-ax of finely tempered bronze, to be used in disentombing the body of King Haalor; and he was armed with a short, leaf-shaped sword, in addition to his bow and quiver of arrows. His garments were made from the fur of a giant bear, brown-black in color.\n\nHoom Feethos and Eibur Tsanth, in raiment heavily quilted with eider-down against the cold, followed him complainingly but with avaricious eagerness. They had not enjoyed the long marches through a desolate, bleakening land, nor the rough fare and exposure to the northern elements. Moreover, they had taken a dislike to Quanga, whom they considered rude and overbearing. Their grievances were aggravated by the fact that he was now compelling them to carry most of the supplies in addition to the two heavy bags. of gold which they were to exchange later for the gems. Nothing less valuable than the rubies of Haalor would have induced them to come so far, or to set foot on the formidable wastes of the ice-sheet.\n\nThe scene before them was like some frozen world of the outer void. Vast, unbroken, save for a few scattered mounds and ridges, the plain extended to the white horizon and its armored peaks. Nothing seemed to live or move on the awful, glistening vistas, whose nearer levels were swept clean of snow. The sun appeared to grow pale and chill, and to recede behind the adventurers; and a wind blew upon them from the ice, like a breath from abysses beyond the pole. Apart from the boreal desolation and drearness, however, there was nothing to dismay Quanga or his companions. None of them was superstitious, and they deemed that the old tales were idle myths, were no more than fear-born delusions. Quanga smiled commiseratively at the thought of his brother Iluac, who had been so oddly frightened and had fancied such extraordinary things after the finding of Haalor. It was a singular weakness in Iluac, the rash and almost foolhardy hunter who had feared neither man nor beast. As to the trapping of Haalor and Ommum-Vog and their army in the glacier, it was plain that they had allowed themselves to be overtaken by the winter storms; and the few survivors, mentally unhinged by their hardships, had told a wild story. Ice — even though it had conquered half of a continent — was merely ice, and its workings conformed invariably to certain natural laws. Iluac had said that the ice-sheet was a great demon, cruel, greedy, and loth to give up that which it had taken. But such beliefs were crude and primitive superstitions, not to be entertained by enlightened minds of the Pieistocene age.\n\nThey had climbed the rampart at an early hour of morning. Quanga assured the jewelers that they would reach the cavern by noon at the latest, even if there should be a certain amount of difficulty and delay in locating it.\n\nThe plain before them was remarkably free of crevasses, and there was little to obstruct their advance. Steering their way with the two breast-shaped mountains for landmarks before them, they come after three hours to a hill-like elevation that corresponded to the mound of Iluac's story. With little trouble, they found the opening of the deep chamber.\n\nIt seemed that the place had changed little if at all since the visit of Iluac, for the interior, with its columns and pendant icicles, conformed closely to his description. The entrance was like a fanged maw. Within, the floor sloped downward at a slippery angle for more than a hundred feet. The chamber swam with a cold and glaucous translucency that filtered through the dome-like roof. At the lower end, in the striated wall, Quanga and the jewelers saw the embedded shapes of a number of men, among which they distinguished easily the tall, blue-clad corpse of King Haalor and the dark, bowed mummy of Ommum-Vog. Behind these, the shapes of others, lifting their serried spears eternally, and receding downward in stiff ranks through unfathomable depths, were faintly discernible.\n\nHaalor stood regal and erect, with wide-open eyes that stared haughtily as in life. Upon his bosom the triangle of hot and blood-bright rubies smouldered unquenchably in the glacial gloom; and the colder eyes of topazes, of beryls, of diamonds, of chrysolites, gleamed and twinkled from his azure raiment. It seemed that the fabulous gems were separated by no more than a foot or two of ice from the greedy fingers of the hunter and his companions.\n\nWithout speaking, they stared raptly at the far-sought treasure. Apart from the great rubies, the jewelers were also estimating the value of the other gems worn by Haalor. These alone, they thought complacently, would have made it worth while to endure the fatigue of the journey and the insolence of Quanga.\n\nThe hunter, on his part, was wishing that he had driven an even steeper bargain. The two bags of gold, however, would make him a wealthy man. He could drink to his full content the costly wines, redder than the rubies, that came from far Uzuldaroum in the south. The tawny, slant-eyed girls of Iqqua would dance at his bidding; and he could gamble for high stakes.\n\nAll three were unmindful of the eeriness of their situation, alone in that boreal solitude with the frozen dead; and they were oblivious likewise to the ghoulish nature of the robbery they were about to commit. Without waiting to be urged by his companions, Quanga raised the keen and highly tempered pick of bronze, and began to assail the translucent wall with mighty blows.\n\nThe ice rang shrilly beneath the pick, and dropped away in crystal splinters and diamond lumps. In a few minutes, he had made a large cavity; and only a thin shell, cracked and shattering, remained before the body of Haalor. This shell Quanga proceeded to pry off with great care; and soon the triangle of monstrous rubies, more or less encrusted still with clinging ice, lay bare to his fingers. While the proud, bleak eyes of Haalor stared immovably upon him from behind their glassy mask, the hunter dropped the pick, and drawing his sharp, leaf-shaped sword from its scabbard, he began to sever the fine silver wires by which the rubies were attached cunningly to the king's raiment. In his haste he ripped away portions of the sea-blue fabric, baring the frozen and dead-white flesh beneath. One by one, as he removed the rubies, he gave them to Hoom Feethos, standing close behind him; and the dealer, bright-eyed with avarice, drooling a little with ecstasy, stored them carefully in a huge pouch of mottled lizard-skin that he had brought along for the purpose.\n\nThe last ruby had been secured, and Quanga was about to turn his attention to the lesser jewels that adorned the king's garments in curious patterns and signs of astrological or hieratic significance. Then, amid their preoccupation, he and Hoom Feethos were startled by a loud and splintering crash that ended with myriad tinklings as of broken glass. Turning, they saw that a huge icicle had fallen from the cavern-dome; and its point, as if aimed unerringly, had cloven the skull of Eibur Tsanth, who lay amid the debris of shattered ice with the sharp end of the fragment deeply embedded in his oozing brain. He had died, instantly, without knowledge of his doom.\n\nThe accident, it seemed, was a perfectly natural one, such as might occur in summer from a slight melting of the immense pendant; but, amid their consternation, Quanga and Hoom Feethos were compelled to take note of certain circumstances that were far from normal or explicable. During the removal of the rubies, on which their attention had been centered so exclusively, the chamber had narrowed to half of its former width, and had also closed down from above, till the hanging icicles were almost upon them, like the champing teeth of some tremendous mouth. The place had darkened, and the light was such as might filter into arctic seas beneath heavy floes. The incline of the cave had grown steeper, as if it were pitching into bottomless depths. Far up -- incredibly far — the two men beheld the tiny entrance, which seemed no bigger than the mouth of a fox's hole.\n\nFor an instant, they were stupefied. The changes of the cavern could admit of no natural explanation; and the Hyperboreans felt the clammy surge of all the superstitious terrors that they had formerly disclaimed. No longer could they deny the conscious, animate malevolence, the diabolic powers of bale imputed to the ice in old legends.\n\nRealizing their peril, and spurred by a wild panic, they started to climb the incline. Hoom Feethos retained the bulging pouch of rubies, as well as the heavy bag of gold coins that hung from his girdle; and Quanga had enough presence of mind to keep his sword and pick-ax. In their terror-driven haste, however, both forgot the second bag of gold, which lay beside Eibur Tsanth, under the debris of the shattered pendant.\n\nThe supernatural narrowing of the cave, the dreadful and sinister closing-down of its roof, had apparently ceased. At any rate, the Hyperboreans could detect no visible continuation of the process as they climbed frantically and precariously toward the opening. They were forced to stoop in many places to avoid the mighty fangs that threatened to descend upon them; and even with the rough tigerskin buskins that they wore, it was hard to keep their footing on the terrible slope. Sometimes they pulled themselves up by means of the slippery, pillar-like formations; and often Quanga, who led the way, was compelled to hew hasty steps in the incline with his pick.\n\nHoom Feethos was too terrified for even the most rudimentary reflection. But Quanga, as he climbed, was considering the monstrous alterations of the cave, which he could not aline with his wide and various experience of the phenomena of nature. He tried to convince himself that he had made a singular error in estimating the chamber's dimensions and the inclination of its fioor. The effort was useless: he still found himself confronted by a thing that outraged his reason; a thing that distorted the known face of the world with unearthly, hideous madness, and mingled a malign chaos with its ordered workings.\n\nAfter an ascent that was frightfully prolonged, like the effort to escape from some delirious, tedious nightmare predicament, they neared the cavern-mouth. There was barely room now for a man to creep on his belly beneath the sharp and ponderous teeth. Quanga, feeling that the fangs might close upon him like those of some great monster, hurled himself forward and started to wriggle through the opening with a most unheroic celerity. Something held him back, and he thought, for one moment of stark horror, that his worst apprehensions were being realized. Then he found that his bow and quiver of arrows, which he had forgotten to remove from his shoulders, were caught against the pendant ice. While Hoom Feethos gibbered in a frenzy of fear and impatience, he crawled back and relieved himself of the impeding weapons, which he thrust before him together with his pick in a second and more successful attempt to pass through the strait opening.\n\nRising to his feet on the open glacier, he heard a wild cry from Hoom Feethos, who, trying to follow Quanga, had become tightly wedged in the entrance through his greater girth. His right hand, clutching the pouch of rubies, was thrust forward beyond the threshold of the cave. He howled incessantly, with half-coherent protestations that the cruel ice-teeth were crunching him to death.\n\nIn spite of the eery terrors that had unmanned him, the hunter still retained enough courage to go back and try to assist Hoom Feethos. He was about to assail the huge icicles with his pick, when he heard an agonizing scream from the jeweler, followed by a harsh and indescribable grating. There had been no visible movement of the fangs — and yet Quanga now saw that they had reached the cavern-floor! The body of Hoom Feethos, pierced through and through by one of the icicles, and ground down by the blunter teeth, was spurting blood on the glacier, like the red mist from a wine-press.\n\nQuanga doubted the very testimony of his senses. The thing before him was patently impossible — there was no mark of cleavage in the mound above the cavern-mouth, to explain the descent of those awful fangs. Before his very eyes, but too swiftly for direct cognition, this unthinkable enormity had occurred.\n\nHoom Feethos was beyond all earthly help, and Quanga, now wholly the slave of a hideous panic, would hardly have stayed longer to assist him in any case. But seeing the pouch that had fallen forward from the dead jeweler's fingers, the hunter snatched it up through an impulse of terror-mingled greed; and then, with no backward glance, he fled on the glacier, toward the low-circling sun.\n\nFor a few moments, as he ran, Quanga failed to perceive the sinister and ill-boding alterations, comparable to those of the cave, whicb had somehow occurred in the sheeted plain itself. With a terrific shock, which became an actual vertigo, he saw that he was climbing a long, insanely tilted slope above whose remote extreme the sun had receded strangely, and was now small and chill as if seen from an outer planet. The very sky was different: though still perfectly cloudless, it had taken on a curious deathly pallor. A brooding sense of inimical volition, a vast and freezing malignity, seemed to pervade the air and to settle upon Quanga like an incubus. But more terrifying than all else, in its proof of a conscious and malign derangement of natural law, was the giddy poleward inclination that had been assumed by the level plateau.\n\nQuanga felt that creation itself had gone mad, and had left him at the mercy of demoniacal forces from the godless outer gulfs. Keeping a perilous foot-hold, weaving and staggering laboriously upward, he feared momently that he would slip and fall and slide back for ever into arctic depths unfathomable. And yet, when he dared to pause at last, and turned shudderingly to peer down at the supposed descent, he saw behind him an acclivity similar in all respects to the one he was climbing: a mad; oblique wall of ice, that rose interminably to a second remote sun.\n\nIn the confusion of that strange bouleversement, he seemed to lose the last remnant of equilibrium; and the glacier reeled and pitched about him like an overturning world as he strove to recover the sense of direction that had never before deserted him. Everywhere, it appeared, there were small and wan parhelia that mocked him above unending glacial scarps. He resumed his hopeless climb through a topsy-turvy world of illusion: whether north, south, east or west, he could not tell.\n\nA sudden wind swept downward on the glacier; it shrieked in Quanga's ears like the myriad voices of taunting devils; it moaned and laughed and ululated with shrill notes as of crackling ice. It seemed to pluck at Quanga with live malicious fingers, to suck the breath for which he had fought agonizingly. In spite of his heavy raiment, and the speed of his toilsome ascent, he felt its bitter, mordant teeth, searching and biting even to the marrow.\n\nDimly, as he continued to climb upward, he saw that the ice was no longer smooth, but had risen into pillars and pyramids around him, or was fretted obscenely into wilder shapes. Immense, malignant profiles leered in blue-green crystal; the malformed heads of bestial devils frowned; and rearing dragons writhed immovably along the scarp, or sank frozen into deep crevasses.\n\nApart from these imaginary forms that were assumed by the ice itself, Quanga saw, or believed that he saw, human bodies and faces embedded in the glacier. Pale hands appeared to reach dimly and imploringly toward him from the depths; and he felt upon him the frost-bound eyes of men who had been lost in former years; and beheld their sunken limbs, grown rigid in strange attitudes of torture.\n\nQuanga was no longer capable of thought. Deaf, blind, primordial terrors, older than reason, had filled his mind with their atavistic darkness. They drove him on implacably, as a beast is driven, and would not let him pause or flag on the mocking, nightmare slope. Reflection would have told him only that his ultimate escape was impossible; that the ice, a live and conscious and maleficent thing, was merely playing a cruel and fantastic game which it had somehow devised in its incredible animism. So, perhaps, it was well that he had lost the power of reflection.\n\nBeyond hope and without warning, he came to the end of the glaciation. It was like the sudden shift of a dream, which takes the dreamer unaware; and he stared uncomprehendingly for some moments at the familiar Hyperborean valleys below the rampart, to the south, and the volcanoes that fumed darkly beyond the southeastern hills.\n\nHis flight from the cavern had consumed almost the whole of the long, subpolar afternoon, and the sun was now swinging close above the horizon. The parhelia had vanished, and the ice-sheet, as if by some prodigious legerdemain, had resumed its normal horizontality. If he had been able to compare his impressions, Quanga would have realized that at no time had he surprised the glacier in the accomplishment of its bewildering supernatural changes.\n\nDoubtfully, as if it were a mirage that might fade at any moment, he surveyed the landscape below the battlements. To all appearances, he had returned to the very place from which he and the jewelers had begun their disastrous journey on the ice. Before him an easy declivity, fretted and runneled, ran down toward the grassy meadows. Fearing that it was all deceitful and unreal — a fair, beguiling trap, a new treachery of the element that he had grown to regard as a cruel and almighty demon — Quanga descended the slope with hasty leaps and bounds. Even when he stood ankle-deep in the great club-mosses, with leafy willows and sedgy grasses about him, he could not quite believe in the verity of his escape.\n\nThe mindless prompting of a panic fear still drove him on; and a primal instinct, equally mindless, drew him toward the volcanic peaks. The instinct told him that he would find refuge from the bitter boreal cold amid their purlieus; and there, if anywhere, he would be safe from the diabolical machinations of the glacier. Boiling springs were said to flow perpetually from the nether slopes of these mountains; great geysers, roaring and hissing like infernal cauldrons, filled the higher gullies with scalding cataracts. The long snows that swept upon Hyperborea were turned to mild rains in the vicinity of the volcanoes; and there a rich and sultry-colored flora, formerly native to the whole region, but now exotic, flourished throughout the seasons.\n\nQuanga could not find the little shaggy horses that he and his companions had left tethered to the dwarf willows in the valley-meadow. Perhaps, after all, it was not the same valley. At any rate, he did not stay his flight to search for them. Without delay or lingering, after one fearful backward look at the menacing mass of the glaciation, he started off in a direct line for the smoke-plumed mountains.\n\nThe sun sank lower, skirting endlessly the southwestern horizon, and flooding the battlemented ice and the rolling landscape with a light of pale amethyst. Quanga, with iron thews inured to protracted marches, pressed on in his unremitting terror, and was overtaken gradually by a long, ethereal-tinted twilight of northern summer.\n\nSomehow, through all the stages of his flight, he had retained the pick-ax, as well as his bow and arrows. Automatically, hours before, he had placed the heavy pouch of rubies in the bosorn of his raiment for safekeeping. He had forgotten them, and he did not even notice the trickle of water from the melting of crusted ice about the jewels, that seeped upon his flesh from the lizard-skin pouch.\n\nCrossing one of the innumerable valleys, he stumbled against a protruding willow-root, and the pick was hurled from his fingers as he fell. Rising to his feet, he ran on without stopping to retrieve it.\n\nA ruddy glow from the volcanoes was now visible on the darkening sky. It brightened as Quanga went on; and he felt that he was nearing the far-sought, inviolable sanctuary. Though still thoroughly shaken and demoralized by his preterhuman ordeals, he began to think that he might escape from the ice-demon after all.\n\nSuddenly he became aware of a consuming thirst, to which he had been oblivious heretofore. Daring to pause in one of the shallow valleys, he drank from a blossom-bordered stream. Then, beneath the crushing load of an unconsciously accumulated fatigue, he flung himself down to rest for a little while among the blood-red poppies that were purple with twilight.\n\nSleep fell like a soft and overwhelming snow upon his eyelids, but was soon broken by evil dreams in which he still fled vainly from the mocking and inexorable glacier. He awoke in a cold horror, sweating and shivering, and found himself staring at the northern sky, where a delicate flush was dying slowly. It seemed to him that a great shadow, malign and massive aod somehow solid, was moving upon the horizon and striding over the low hills toward the valley in which he lay. It came with inexpressible speed, and the last light appeared to fall from the heavens, chill as a reflection caught in ice.\n\nHe started to his feet with the stiffness of prolonged exhaustion in all his body, and the nightmare stupefaction of slumber still mingling with his half-awakened fears. In this state, with a mad, momentary defiance, he unslung his bow and discharged arrow after arrow, emptying his quiver at the huge and bleak and formless shadow that seemed to impend before him on the sky. Having done this, he resumed his headlong flight.\n\nEven as he ran, he shivered uncontrollably with the sudden and intense cold that had filled the valley. Vaguely, with an access of fear, he felt that there was something unwholesome and unnatural about the cold — something that did not belong to the place or the season. The glowing volcanoes were quite near, and soon he would reach their outlying hills. The air about him should be temperate, even if not actually warm.\n\nAll at once, the air darkened before him, with a sourceless, blue-green glimmering in its depths. For a moment, he saw the featureless Shadow that rose gigantically upon his path and obscured the very stars and the glare of the volcanoes. Then, with the swirling of a tempest-driven vapor, it closed about him, gelid and relentless. It was like phantom ice — a thing that blinded his eyes and stifled his breath, as if he were buried in some glacial tomb. It was cold with a transarctic rigor, such as he had never known, that ached unbearably in all his flesh, and was followed by a swiftly spreading numbness.\n\nDimly he heard a sound as of clashing icicles, a grinding as of heavy floes, in the blue-green gloom that tightened and thickened around him. It was as if the soul of the glacier, malign and implacable, had overtaken him in his flight. At times he struggled numbly, in half-drowsy terror. With some obscure impulse, as if to propitiate a vengeful deity, he took the pouch of rubies from his bosom with prolonged and painful effort, aod tried to hurl it away. The thongs that tied the pouch were loosened by its fall, and Quanga heard faintly, as if from a great distance, the tinkle of the rubies as they rolled and scattered on some hard surface. Then oblivion deepened about him, and he fell forward stiffly, without knowing that he had fallen.\n\nMorning found him beside a little stream, stark-frozen, and lying on his face in a circle of poppies that had been blackened as if by the footprint of some gigantic demon of frost. A nearby pool, formed by the leisurely rill, was covered with thin ice; and on the ice, like gouts of frozen blood, there lay the scattered rubies of Haalor. In its own time, the great glacier, moving slowly and irresistibly southward, would reclaim them.",
        "content_cn": "猎人匡加与伊夸城两位最富冒险精神的珠宝商霍姆·菲索斯和艾伯·赞斯，踏入了人类罕至的疆域——那片有去无回的绝境。他们自伊夸北行，闯入荒芜的姆图兰大地。极地冰川波拉里昂如冻结之海席卷而来，将繁华古城连同整片地峡埋葬于永恒冰层之下。\n\n传说瑟恩戈斯贝壳状的穹顶仍深嵌冰渊，奥贡-扎伊的尖塔与蕨棕榈、猛犸巨兽及黑色方形的札特瓜神庙皆封存其中。这场浩劫发生于数百年前，而这道璀璨冰墙至今仍在向南吞噬废弃的疆土。\n\n此刻，匡加正带领同伴沿着冰川前线展开一场豪赌。他们的目标竟是哈尔洛国王的红宝石——五十年前，这位君主与巫师奥姆-沃格率领重甲士兵远征极地冰川，最终全军覆没。仅存的残兵败将在两月后逃回伊夸，讲述了一个骇人听闻的故事：\n\n大军在奥姆-沃格选定的冰原丘陵扎营。巫师立于金烟缭绕的青铜火盆阵中，吟诵比世界更古老的咒文，召唤出比南行太阳更为巨大的赤红火球。炽烈光焰令天日黯然失色，士兵们在重甲下几近昏厥。冰川边缘在高温中融化为奔涌河流，哈尔洛一度幻想收复先祖统治的姆图兰疆域。\n\n然而融水汇成急流时，河面突然腾起苍白的窒息雾霭。奥姆-沃格的咒术太阳被雾气遮蔽，寒光渐弱终至失效。巫师徒劳施展其他法术，可雾气如幽灵蛇群般缠绕凝结，将死亡寒意渗入骨髓。冰雾笼罩营地，士兵们摸索不见彼此面容。少数幸存者逃出雾障后回首，惊见冰层已如墓碑般覆盖整座丘陵，封存着他们的君主与同伴。\n\n伊夸人对此传说将信将疑，但继任者再无人敢挑战冰川。人们开始流传新的恐怖故事：冰原会如活物般伸出魔爪吞噬孤旅，裂开的冰隙似巨口闭合，北风恶魔的吐息能将血肉瞬间凝为石像。最终这片区域成为禁地，唯有最悍勇的猎人才敢踏入冬寂荒原。\n\n匡加的兄长伊鲁阿克正是这样的猎手。他曾追逐巨型黑狐深入姆图兰，在冰原丘陵发现洞穴。绿光幽微的冰窟深处，他看见透明冰墙中封存着持矛士兵的遗体。队列最前方是身着海蓝王袍的傲慢身影，胸前排列着鲜血般艳红的三角形宝石——正是失踪的哈尔洛王与奥姆-沃格。伊鲁阿克仓皇逃离后声称冰川形态诡变，最终命丧白熊之口。\n\n匡加却毫无惧意。某个夏日，他带着北境山谷发现的红榴石来到伊夸，向珠宝商们透露了冰封宝藏的传说。贪婪驱使下，三人结盟踏上险途。此刻他们正穿越亚北极荒原，逼近永恒冰川的边界。\n\n无云的绿松石色天穹悬着低垂的太阳，未融积雪堆积在山阴处。曾经繁茂的森林已退化为稀疏灌木，唯有罂粟花在草甸上铺展猩红地毯，白睡莲点缀着滞流水潭。东方火山喷发着抗拒冰川的浓烟，西方峭壁雪峰则早被冰海吞没。\n\n他们留下矮种马，沿匡加选定的冰坡攀登。猎人手持青铜冰镐，腰悬叶形短剑；珠宝商们裹着羽绒抱怨连连，却仍紧攥装满金币的皮袋。展现在眼前的是一片凝固的异界：无垠冰原延伸至地平线，唯有几处隆起打破单调。太阳在他们身后褪色，冰风带着极渊气息扑面而来。\n\n正午时分，他们找到了伊鲁阿克描述的冰丘。洞口如獠牙巨口，内部倾斜百余尺。柱状冰凌垂挂的穹顶滤出幽绿冷光。冰壁深处，海蓝王袍的哈尔洛与黑袍巫师赫然在目，身后是无数持矛士兵的幽影。国王胸前的红宝石三角在冰层后燃烧，其他珠宝也在王袍上闪烁。\n\n三人贪婪凝视近在咫尺的财富。匡加抡起青铜冰镐猛击冰壁，水晶碎块如钻石雨纷落。当最后一层薄冰碎裂，哈尔洛凝固的傲慢目光穿透冰晶面具直视着盗宝者。猎人用叶形剑割断银线，将红宝石逐一交给身后垂涎欲滴的珠宝商。每颗宝石离开王袍时，都会撕下几缕海蓝布料，露出下方死白的冻结血肉。\n\n他们全然未觉：冰窟正随宝石的剥离发生微妙震颤，仿佛某个沉睡万古的存在被惊动了......\n\n最后一颗红宝石已然到手，昆伽正要将注意力转向国王衣袍上那些排列成奇异星象与神圣符文的次等宝石。就在他们全神贯注之际，一阵震耳欲裂的轰响突然惊破了寂静，无数玻璃碎裂般的清脆余音在冰窟中回荡。他们转身望去，只见一根巨大的冰锥从穹顶坠落——那锋利的尖端仿佛经过精确瞄准，径直劈开了艾伯·赞斯的头颅。此刻他正躺在碎冰堆中，尖锐的冰锥深深嵌进他汩汩冒血的脑浆里。死亡来得如此突然，他甚至来不及知晓自己的厄运。\n\n这场意外看似完全合乎自然规律，就像夏日里巨型冰凌轻微融化导致的坠落。但在惊骇之余，昆伽与胡姆·菲索斯不得不注意到某些绝非寻常的现象：当他们专注于摘取红宝石时，整个冰窟的宽度已悄然缩减至原先的一半，顶部也以骇人的速度下压，悬垂的冰锥几乎触到他们头顶，宛如某种庞然巨兽正在咀嚼的利齿。洞窟光线变得幽暗，仿佛极地冰层下透来的微光。地面倾斜角度愈发陡峭，如同正坠向无底深渊。在遥不可及的高处——远得令人难以置信——两人看见入口已缩成狐狸洞般的尺寸。\n\n他们呆立了片刻。冰窟的异变无法用常理解释，这些曾对迷信嗤之以鼻的极北之民，此刻正被黏腻的恐惧攫住咽喉。古老传说中冰原蕴含的邪恶意念与恶魔力量，此刻再难否认。\n\n意识到危机迫近，恐慌驱使他们开始攀爬陡坡。胡姆·菲索斯仍紧攥着鼓胀的红宝石袋与腰间沉甸甸的金币囊；昆伽尚存理智未弃长剑与冰镐。但在仓皇逃窜中，他们都忘了第二袋金子——它正躺在艾伯·赞斯身旁，掩埋在碎裂的冰锥之下。\n\n冰窟诡异的收缩与顶部险恶的下压似乎暂时停滞。至少当两人疯狂攀向出口时，未见异变继续。他们不得不弯腰躲避随时可能坠落的冰牙，即便穿着粗糙的虎皮靴，仍难在这噩梦般的斜坡站稳。有时他们需攀附滑溜的冰柱借力；开路在前的昆伽不得不频繁用冰镐凿出落脚点。\n\n胡姆·菲索斯恐惧得丧失思考能力。而昆伽攀爬时仍在思索冰窟的畸变——这远超他广博的自然认知。他试图说服自己误判了洞窟尺寸与地面倾角，却无法忽视眼前违背理性的存在：某种扭曲现实的可怖疯狂，将恶意的混沌注入有序世界。\n\n这场犹如挣脱无尽梦魇的漫长攀爬后，他们终于接近洞口。此刻尖锐的冰牙距地面仅容人匍匐爬行。昆伽感觉那些利齿随时会如巨兽般咬合，便不顾形象地猛冲向前。某物却拽住了他——刹那间他以为最坏的预感成真，随后发现是忘摘的弓箭卡在了冰锥上。当胡姆·菲索斯在后方恐惧啜泣时，他退回卸下碍事的武器，终于成功钻出狭口。\n\n刚在冰川站稳，他便听见胡姆·菲索斯的惨叫——这位体型更胖的珠宝商被死死卡在洞口，唯有攥着宝石袋的右手伸出冰窟。他断续哀嚎着冰牙正将他碾碎。尽管被超自然恐惧摧垮了勇气，昆伽仍折返试图救援。正当他举起冰镐准备击碎冰牙时，珠宝商突然发出撕心裂肺的尖叫，随后是某种难以描述的碾磨声。那些利齿明明纹丝未动——却已瞬间闭合至地面！胡姆·菲索斯被冰锥贯穿的身躯正像榨酒器般喷溅鲜血。\n\n昆伽怀疑自己的感官。眼前景象彻底违背常理——冰窟上方的冰层毫无断裂痕迹。这不可名状的可怖异变就在他眼前发生了，快得超出认知。\n\n胡姆·菲索斯已无生还可能，而彻底被恐惧支配的昆伽也无意久留。但当他瞥见死者指间滑落的宝石袋时，贪欲混着恐惧促使他一把攫取。随后他头也不回地逃离冰川，奔向低垂的落日。\n\n奔逃中的昆伽起初未察觉冰原的诡谲异变。直到眩晕袭来，他才惊觉自己正攀爬着疯狂倾斜的斜坡——远处的地平线上，太阳诡异地退缩成外行星视角般冰冷渺小。天空呈现出死寂的苍白，某种冻结万物的恶意如梦魇般压迫着他。最令人毛骨悚然的是整座高原正以违背物理法则的角度向极地倾斜。\n\n昆伽感觉造物主已然疯癫，将他抛弃给无神深渊的恶魔之力。他踉跄攀爬，时刻恐惧会坠入无底冰渊。可当他颤抖着回望时，身后竟出现与前方完全相同的斜坡——一道倾斜的冰之绝壁，延伸向第二轮遥不可及的太阳。\n\n在这颠倒错乱的迷局中，他彻底丧失了方向感。冰川如倾覆的世界般旋转，四面八方苍白的小幻日嘲弄般悬在无尽冰崖之上。他继续着绝望的攀爬，却分不清东南西北。\n\n刺骨寒风突然席卷冰原，在昆伽耳畔啸叫成无数恶魔的讥笑。它用活物般的恶意手指撕扯他的衣袍，吞噬他艰难获取的每一口空气。尽管穿着厚重毛皮，他仍感觉寒气的利齿咬进了骨髓。\n\n攀爬中他模糊看见冰面不再平滑，而是隆起成恶形恶状的冰柱与金字塔。青蓝水晶中浮现狞笑的侧脸，兽形魔鬼的畸形头颅，以及冻结在冰崖上扭动的龙形。更可怕的是，他仿佛看见冰川中封存着人形——苍白的手臂从冰层深处向他探来，那些多年前遇难者冻僵的肢体凝固成受刑的姿势。\n\n原始恐惧已吞噬昆伽的理智。他像被驱赶的野兽般机械攀爬，不敢在这嘲弄般的梦魇斜坡停留片刻。若尚能思考，他会明白逃脱本就不可能——这活物般的恶冰不过在进行一场残酷游戏。或许丧失思考能力反而是种仁慈。\n\n毫无预兆地，他突然抵达冰川尽头。这转变如梦似幻——他茫然凝视着南方熟悉的极北山谷，以及东南丘陵后冒烟的火山群。\n\n逃离冰窟耗尽了漫长的极地白昼，太阳此刻正悬在地平线上。幻日已然消失，冰原恢复了水平状态，仿佛先前的异变只是幻术。若有余力对比，他会发现始终未能目睹冰川变形的过程。\n\n他犹疑地俯视着城墙下的景色，仿佛这一切随时会如海市蜃楼般消散。眼前缓坡通向青草甸，与灾难之旅的起点别无二致。恐惧这美景是冰之恶魔的新陷阱，他纵身跃下斜坡。即便双脚踏进茂密的石松丛，他仍不敢相信自己已然脱险。\n\n无意识的恐慌仍驱使他奔向火山群。原始本能告诉他：唯有在那沸腾的硫磺泉与终年不冻的暖域，才能逃脱冰川的邪恶魔力。传说中火山脚下的温泉永不冻结，喷发的间歇泉将山沟填满滚烫瀑布。极北之地的暴雪在此化作温和细雨，孕育着四季常艳的奇花异草。\n\n昆伽找不到拴在矮柳上的鬃毛矮马。或许这本就是不同的山谷。他没有停留搜寻，在对冰川投去最后惊惧的一瞥后，径直朝烟柱缭绕的群山奔去。\n\n夕阳将冰城墙与起伏的原野染成淡紫。昆伽凭借铁铸般的体格在渐浓的暮色中狂奔。不知为何，他始终未丢弃冰镐与弓箭，红宝石袋也一直紧贴胸膛。他甚至未注意到袋中融冰正渗过蜥蜴皮，浸湿他的肌肤。\n\n穿越某道山谷时，突出的柳根将他绊倒，冰镐脱手飞出。他爬起后竟未拾取，继续狂奔。\n\n火山群的红光已映亮天际。随着距离缩短，昆伽开始相信能逃脱冰之恶魔的魔掌。这时他才惊觉喉间灼烧般的干渴，壮胆在某条浅溪边俯身饮水。随后难以抵挡的疲惫将他压倒，他瘫在暮色中泛紫的猩红罂粟丛里。\n\n睡意如雪崩般压垮他的眼帘，但噩梦很快纠缠而来——他仍在无情冰川的追逐中徒劳奔逃。他在冷汗涔涔中惊醒，发现自己正凝视着北方天际渐逝的霞光。一个庞大而恶意的黑影正以难以形容的速度掠过丘陵，向他所在的山谷压来。最后的天光仿佛被吸进冰层，寒意刺骨。\n\n他僵硬地爬起，半梦半醒间疯狂拉弓，将箭矢尽数射向空中无形的黑影。箭囊空后，他再度开始亡命奔逃。\n\n就在他奔逃之际，一阵突如其来的刺骨寒意席卷山谷，令他不可抑制地战栗起来。某种模糊而强烈的恐惧攫住了他——这寒意中透着病态与反常，与这片土地、这个季节都格格不入。发光的火山近在咫尺，他很快就能抵达外围丘陵。周遭空气本该温和宜人，即便算不上温暖。\n\n突然间，前方的空气骤然晦暗，深处泛起无源的青绿色幽光。刹那间，他看见一道无定形的阴影拔地而起，巍然耸立在逃亡之路上，连群星与火山的光芒都被其遮蔽。随后这阴影如同暴风驱策的雾气般翻涌着将他包裹，冰冷无情。那感觉犹如幽灵般的寒冰——不仅令他双目失明，更扼住他的呼吸，恍若被埋葬在冰川墓穴之中。那是超越极北之地的酷寒，他从未体验过的严寒，每一寸血肉都在难以忍受地剧痛，随即迅速蔓延成麻木。\n\n在愈缩愈紧的青绿色幽暗中，他隐约听见冰棱相撞的脆响，以及厚重浮冰相互碾磨的轰鸣。仿佛冰川那恶毒而冷酷的精魂，终究在他逃亡途中追上了他。他时而麻木地挣扎，陷入半昏半醒的恐惧。出于某种晦暗的冲动，像是要平息复仇之神的怒火，他艰难而痛苦地从怀中掏出那袋红宝石，试图将其抛远。皮袋坠地时系带松脱，宽加听见红宝石滚落在坚硬表面发出的微弱叮当声，恍若来自遥远之地。随后遗忘的黑暗彻底笼罩了他，他僵硬地向前栽倒，甚至未曾察觉自己已然倒下。\n\n晨光降临时，人们发现他僵冻如石，面朝下倒在一圈已然发黑的罂粟花丛中，仿佛被某个霜冻恶魔的巨足践踏过。附近由潺潺溪流汇成的水塘覆着薄冰，冰面上散落着哈洛尔的红宝石，犹如凝结的血滴。终有一日，那座缓慢而不可阻挡地向南推进的巨大冰川，将会把它们尽数收回。"

        "content": "\n\n(Chapter IX of the Book of Eibon)\n\nRendered from the Old French manuscript of Gaspard du Nord.\n\nEvagh the warlock, dwelling beside the boreal sea, was aware of many strange and untimely portents in mid-summer. Frorely burned the sun above Mhu Thulan from a welkin clear and wannish as ice. At eve the aurora was hung from zenith to earth, like an arras in a high chamber of gods. Wan and rare were the poppies and small the anemones in the cliff-sequestered vales lying behind the house of Evagh; and the fruits in his walled garden were pale of rind and green at the core. Also, he beheld by day the unseasonable flight of great multitudes of fowl, going southward from the hidden isles beyond Mhu Thulan; and by night he heard the distressful clamor of other passing multitudes. And always, in the loud wind and crying surf, he harkened to the weird whisper of voices from realms of perennial winter.\n\nNow Evagh was troubled by these portents, even as the rude fisher-folk on the shore of the haven below his house were troubled. Being a past-master of all sortilege, and a seer of remote and future things, he made use of his arts in an effort to divine their meaning. But a cloud was upon his eyes through the daytime; and a darkness thwarted him when he sought illumination in dreams. His most cunning horoscopes were put to naught; his familiars were silent or answered him equivocally; and confusion was amid all his geomancies and hydromancies and haruspications. And it seemed to Evagh that an unknown power worked against him, mocking and making impotent in such fashion the sorcery that none had defeated heretofore. And Evagh knew, by certain tokens perceptible to wizards, that the power was an evil power, and its boding was of bale to man.\n\nDay by day, through the middle summer, the fisher-folk went forth in their coracles of elk-hide and willow, casting their seines. But in the seines they drew dead fishes, blasted as if by fire or extreme cold; and they drew living monsters, such as their eldest captains had never beheld: things triple-headed and tailed and finned with horror; black, shapeless things that turned to a liquid foulness and ran away from the net; or headless things like bloated moons with green, frozen rays about them; or things leprous-eyed and bearded with stiffly-oozing slime.\n\nThen, out of the sea-horizoned north, where ships from Cerngoth were wont to ply among the Arctic islands, a galley came drifting with idle oars and aimlessly veering helm. The tide beached it among the boats of the fishermen, which fared no longer to sea but were drawn up on the sands below the cliff-built house of Evagh. And, thronging about the galley in awe and wonder, the fishers beheld its oarsmen still at the oars and its captain at the helm. But the faces and hands of all were stark as bone, and were white as the flesh of leprosy; and the pupils of their open eyes had faded strangely, being indistinguishable now from the whites; and a blankness of horror was within them, like ice in deep pools that are fast frozen to the bottom. And Evagh himself, descending later, also beheld the galley's crew, and pondered much concerning the import of this prodigy.\n\nLoath were the fishers to touch the dead men; and they murmured, saying that a doom was upon the sea, and a curse upon all sea-faring things and people. But Evagh, deeming that the bodies would rot in the sun and would breed pestilence, commanded them to build a pile of driftwood about the galley; and when the pile had risen above the bulwarks, hiding from view the dead rowers, he fired it with his own hands.\n\nHigh flamed the pile, and smoke ascended black as a storm-cloud, and was borne in windy volumes past the tall towers of Evagh on the cliff. But later, when the fire sank, the bodies of the oarsmen were seen sitting amid the mounded embers; and their arms were still outstretched in the attitude of rowing, and their fingers were clenched; though the oars had now dropped away from them in brands and ashes. And the captain of the galley stood upright still in his place: though the burnt helm had fallen beside him. Naught but the raiment of the marble corpses had been consumed; and they shone white as moon-washed marble above the charrings of wood; and nowhere upon them was there any blackness from the fire.\n\nDeeming this thing an ill miracle, the fishers were all aghast, and they fled swiftly to the uppermost rocks. There remained with Evagh only his two servants, the boy Ratha and the ancient crone Ahilidis, who had both witnessed many of his conjurations and were thus well inured to sights of magic. And, with these two beside him, the sorcerer awaited the cooling of the brands.\n\nQuickly the brands darkened; but smoke arose from them still throughout the noon and afternoon; and still they were over-hot for human treading when the hour drew toward sunset. So Evagh bade his servants to fetch water in urns from the sea and cast it upon the ashes and charrings. And after the smoke and the hissing had died, he went forward and approached the pale corpses. Nearing them, he was aware of a great coldness, such as would emanate from trans-Arctic ice; and the coldness began to ache in his hands and ears, and smote sharply through the mantle of fur. Going still closer, he touched one of the bodies with his forefinger-tip; and the finger, though lightly pressed and quickly withdrawn, was seared as if by flame.\n\nEvagh was much amazed: for the condition of the corpses was a thing unknown to him heretofore; and in all his science of wizardry there was naught to enlighten him. He bethought him that a spell had been laid upon the dead: an ensorcelling such as the wan polar demons might weave, or the chill witches of the moon might devise in their caverns of snow. And he deemed it well to retire for the time, lest the spell should now take effect upon others than the dead.\n\nReturning to his house ere night, he burned at each door and window the gums that are most offensive to the northern demons; and at each angle where a spirit might enter, he posted one of his own familiars to guard against all intrusion. Afterwards, while Ratha and Ahilidis slept, he perused with sedulous care the writings of Pnom, in which are collated many powerful exorcisms. But ever and anon, as he read again, for his comfort, the old rubrics, he remembered ominously the saying of the prophet Lith, which no man had understood: \"There is One that inhabits the place of utter cold, and One that respireth where none other may draw breath. In the days to come He shall issue forth among the isles and cities of men, and shall bring with Him as a white doom the wind that slumbereth in his dwelling.\"\n\nThough a fire burned in the chamber, piled with fat pine and terebinth, it seemed that a deadly chill began to invade the air toward midnight. Then, as Evagh turned uneasily from the parchments of Pnom, and saw that the fires blazed high as if in no need of replenishment, he heard the sudden turmoil of a great wind full of sea-birds eerily shrieking, and the cries of land-fowl driven on helpless wings, and over all a high laughter of diabolic voices. Madly from the north the wind beat upon his square-based towers; and birds were cast like blown leaves of autumn against the stout-paned windows; and devils seemed to tear and strain at the granite walls. Though the room's door was shut and the windows were tight-closed, an icy gust went round and round, circling the table where Evagh sat, snatching the broad parchments of Pnom from beneath his fingers, and plucking at the lamp-flame.\n\nVainly, with numbing thoughts, he strove to recall that counter-charm which is most effective against the spirits of the boreal quarter. Then, strangely, it seemed that the wind fell, leaving a mighty stillness about the house. The chill gust was gone from the room, the lamp and the fire burned steadily, and something of warmth returned slowly into the half-frozen marrow of Evagh.\n\nSoon he was made aware of a light shining beyond his chamber windows, as if a belated moon had now risen above the rocks. But Evagh knew that the moon was at that time a thin crescent, declining with eventide. It seemed that the light shone from the north, pale and frigid as fire of ice; and going to the window he beheld a great beam that traversed all the sea, coming as if from the hidden pole. In that light the rocks were paler than marble, and the sands were whiter than sea-salt, and the huts of the fishermen were as white tombs. The walled garden of Evagh was full of the beam, and all the green had departed from its foliage and its blossoms were like flowers of snow. And the beam fell bleakly on the lower walls of his house, but left still in shadow the wall of that upper chamber from which he looked.\n\nHe thought that the beam poured from a pale cloud that had mounted above the sea-line, or else from a white peak that had lifted skyward in the night; but of this he was uncertain. Watching, he saw that it rose higher in the heavens but climbed not upon his walls. Pondering in vain the significance of the mystery, he seemed to hear in the air about him a sweet and wizard voice. And, speaking in a tongue that he knew not, the voice uttered a rune of slumber. And Evagh could not resist the rune, and upon him fell such a numbness of sleep as overcomes the outworn watcher in a place of snow.\n\nWalking stiffly at dawn, he rose up from the floor where he had lain, and witnessed a strange marvel. For, lo, in the harbour there towered an iceberg such as no vessel had yet sighted in all its sea-faring to the north, and no legend had told of among the dim Hyperborean isles. It filled the broad haven from shore to shore, and sheered up to a height immeasurable with piled escarpments and tiered precipices; and its pinnacles hung like towers in the zenith above the house of Evagh. It was higher than the dread mountain Achoravomas, which belches rivers of flame and liquid stone that pour unquenched through Tscho Vulpanomi to the austral main. It was steeper than the mountain Yarak, which marks the site of the boreal pole; and from it there fell a wan glittering on sea and land. Deathly and terrible was the glittering, and Evagh knew that this was the light he had beheld in the darkness.\n\nScarce could he draw breath in the cold that was on the air; and the light of the huge iceberg seared his eyeballs with an exceeding froreness. Yet he perceived an odd thing, that the rays of the glittering fell indirectly and to either side of his house; and the lower chambers, where Ratha and Ahilidis slept, were no longer touched by the beam as in the night; and upon all his house there was naught but the early sun and the morning shadows.\n\nOn the shore below he saw the charrings of the beached galley, and amid them the white corpses incombustible by fire. And along the sands and rocks, the fisher-folk were lying or standing upright in still, rigid postures, as if they had come forth from their hiding-places to behold the pale beam and had been smitten by a magic sleep. And the whole harbour-shore, and the garden of Evagh, even to the front threshold of his house, was like a place where frost has fallen thickly over all.\n\nAgain he remembered the saying of Lith; and with much foreboding he descended to the ground story. There, at the northern windows, the boy Ratha and the hag Ahilidis were leaning with faces turned to the light. Stiffly they stood, with wide-open eyes, and a pale terror was in their regard, and upon them was the white death of the galley's crew. And, nearing them, the sorcerer was stayed by the terrible chillness that smote upon him from their bodies.\n\nHe would have fled from the house, knowing his magic wholly ineffectual against this thing. But it came to him that death was in the direct falling of the rays from the iceberg, and, leaving the house, he must perforce enter that fatal light. And it came to him also that he alone, of all who dwelt on that shore, had been exempted from the death. He could not surmise the reason of his exemption; but in the end he deemed it best to remain patiently and without fear, waiting whatever should befall.\n\nReturning to his chamber he busied himself with various conjurations. But his familiars had gone away in the night, forsaking the angles at which he had posted them; and no spirit either human or demoniacal made reply to his questions. And not in any way known to wizards could he learn aught of the iceberg or divine the least inkling of its secret.\n\nPresently, as he laboured with his useless cantrips, he felt on his face the breathing of a wind that was not air but a subtler and rarer element cold as the moon's ether. His own breath forsook him with agonies unspeakable, and he fell down on the floor in a sort of swoon that was near to death. In the swoon he was doubtfully aware of voices uttering unfamiliar spells. Invisible fingers touched him with icy pangs; and about him came and went a bleak radiance, like a tide that flows and ebbs and flows again . Intolerable was the radiance to all his senses; but it brightened slowly, with briefer ebbings; and in time his eyes and his flesh were tempered to endure it. Full upon him now was the light of the iceberg through his northern windows; and it seemed that a great Eye regarded him in the light. He would have risen to confront the Eye; but his swoon held him like a palsy.\n\nAfter that, he slept again for a period. Waking, he found in all his limbs their wonted strength and quickness. The strange light was still upon him, filling all his chamber; and peering out he witnessed a new marvel. For, lo, his garden and the rocks and sea-sands below it were visible no longer. In their stead were level spaces of ice about his house, and tall ice-pinnacles that rose like towers from the broad battlements of a fortress. Beyond the verges of the ice he beheld a sea that lay remotely and far beneath; and beyond the sea the low looming of a dim shore.\n\nTerror came to Evagh now, for he recognized in all this the workings of a sorcery plenipotent and beyond the power of all mortal wizards. For plain it was that his high house of granite stood no longer on the coast of Mhu Thulan, but was based now on some upper crag of the iceberg. Trembling, he knelt then and prayed to the Old Ones, who dwell secretly in subterrene caverns, or abide under the sea or in the supermundane spaces. And even as he prayed, he heard a loud knocking at the door of his house.\n\nIn much fear and wonder he descended and flung wide the portals. Before him were two men, or creatures who had the likeness of men. Both were strange of visage and bright-skinned, and they wore for mantles such rune-woven stuffs as wizards wear. The runes were uncouth and alien; but when the man bespoke him he understood something of their speech, which was in a dialect of the Hyperborean isles.\n\n\"We serve the One whose coming was foretold by the prophet Lith,\" they said. \"From spaces beyond the limits of the north he hath come in his floating citadel, the ice-mountain Yikilth, to voyage the mundane oceans and to blast with a chill spendour the puny peoples of humankind. He hath spared us alone amid the inhabitants of the broad isle Thulask, and hath taken us to go with him in his sea-faring upon Yikilth. He hath tempered our flesh to the rigour of his abode, and hath made respirable for us the air in which no mortal man may draw breath. Thee also he hath spared and hath acclimated by his spells to the coldness and the thin ether that go everywhere with Yikilth. Hail, O Evagh, whom we know for a great wizard by this token: since only the mightiest of warlocks are thus chosen and exempted.\"\n\nSorely astonished was Evagh; but seeing that he had now to deal with men who were as himself, he questioned closely the two magicians of Thulask. They were named Dooni and Ux Loddhan, and were wise in the lore of the elder gods. The name of the One that they served was Rlim Shaikorth, and he dwelt in the highest summit of the ice-mountain. They told Evagh nothing of the nature or properties of Rlim Shaikorth; and concerning their own service to this being they avowed only that it consisted of such worship as is given to a god, together with the repudiation of all bonds that had linked them heretofore to mankind. And they told Evagh that he was to go with them before Rlim Shaikorth, and perform the due rite of obeisance, and accept the bond of final alienage.\n\nSo Evagh went with Dooni and Ux Loddhan and was led by them to a great pinnacle of ice that rose unmeltable into the wan sun, beetling above all its fellows on the flat top of the berg. The pinnacle was hollow, and climbing therein by stairs of ice, they came at last to the chamber of Rlim Shaikorth, which was a circular dome with a round block at the center, forming a dais. And on the dais was that being whose advent prophet Lith had foretold obscurely.\n\nAt sight of this entity, the pulses of Evagh were stilled for an instant by terror; and, following quickly upon the terror, his gorge rose within him through excess of loathing. In all the world there was naught that could be likened for its foulness to Rlim Shaikorth. Something he had of the semblance of a fat white worm; but his bulk was beyond that of the sea-elephant. His half-coiled tail was thick as the middle folds of his body; and his front reared upward from the dais in the form of a white round disk, and upon it were imprinted vaguely the lineaments of a visage belonging neither to beast of the earth nor ocean-creature. And amid the visage a mouth curved uncleanly from side to side of the disk, opening and shutting incessantly on a pale and tongueless and toothless maw. The eye-sockets of Rlim Shaikorth were close together between his shallow nostrils; and the sockets were eyeless, but in them appeared from moment to moment globules of a blood-coloured matter having the form of eyeballs; and ever the globules broke and dripped down before the dais. And from the ice-floor of the dome there ascended two masses like stalagmites, purple and dark as frozen gore, which had been made by the ceaseless dripping of the globules.\n\nDooni and Ux Loddhan prostrated themselves before the being, and Evagh deemed it well to follow their example. Lying prone on the ice, he heard the red drops falling with a splash as of heavy tears; and then, in the dome above him, it seemed that a voice spoke; and the voice was like the sound of some hidden cataract in a glacier hollow with caverns.\n\n\"Behold, O Evagh,\" said the voice. \"I have preserved thee from the doom of thy fellow-men, and have made thee as they that inhabit the bourn of coldness, and they that inhale the airless void. Wisdom ineffable shall be thine, and mastery beyond the conquest of mortals, if thou wilt but worship me and become my thrall. With me thou shalt voyage amid the kingdoms of the north, and shalt pass among the green southern islands, and see the white falling of death upon them in the light from Yikilth. Our coming shall bring eternal frost on their gardens, and shall set upon their people's flesh the seal of that gulf whose rigor paleth one by one the most ardent stars, and putteth rime at the core of suns. All this thou shalt witness, being as one of the lords of death, supernal and immortal; and in the end thou shalt return with me to that world beyond the uttermost pole, in which is mine abiding empire. For I am he whose coming even the gods may not oppose.\"\n\nNow, seeing that he was without choice in the matter, Evagh professed himself willing to yield worship and service to the pale worm. Beneath the instruction of Dooni and Ux Loddhan, he performed the sevenfold rite that is scarce suitable for narration here, and swore the threefold vow of unspeakable alienation.\n\nThereafter, for many days and nights, he sailed with Rlim Shaikorth adown the coast of Mhu Thulan. Strange was the manner of that voyaging, for it seemed that the great iceberg was guided by the sorcery of the worm, prevailing ever against wind and tide. And always, by night or day, like the beams of a deathly beacon, the chill splendour smote afar from Yikilth. Proud galleys were overtaken as they fled southward, and their crews were blasted at the oars; and often ships were caught and embedded in the new bastions of ice that formed daily around the base of that ever-growing mountain.\n\nThe fair Hyperborean ports, busy with maritime traffic, were stilled by the passing of Rlim Shaikorth. Idle were their streets and wharves, idle was the shipping in their harbours, when the pale light had come and gone. Far inland fell the rays, bringing to the fields and gardens a blight of trans-Arctic winter; and forests were frozen and the beasts that roamed them were turned as if into marble, so that men who came long afterward to that region found the elk and bear and mammoth still standing in all the postures of life. But, dwelling upon Yikilth, the sorcerer Evagh was immune to the icy death; and, sitting in his house or walking abroad on the berg, he was aware of no sharper cold than that which abides in summer shadows.\n\nNow, beside Dooni and Ux Loddhan, the sorcerers of Thulask, there were five other wizards that went with Evagh on that voyage, having been chosen by Rlim Shaikorth. They too had been tempered to the coldness by Yikilth, and their houses had been transported to the berg by unknown enchantment. They were outlandish and uncouth men, called Polarians, from islands nearer the pole than broad Thulask; and Evagh could understand little of their ways; and their sorcery was foreign to him, and their speech was unintelligible; nor was it known to the Thulaskians.\n\nDaily the eight wizards found on their tables all the provender necessary for human sustenance; though they knew not the agency by which it was supplied. All were united in the worship of the white worm; and all, it seemed, were content in a measure with their lot, and were fain of that unearthly lore and dominion which the worm had promised them. But Evagh was uneasy at heart, and rebelled in secret against his thralldom to Rlim Shaikorth; and he beheld with revulsion the doom that went forth eternally from Yikilth upon lovely cities and fruitful ocean-shores. Ruthfully he saw the blasting of flower-girdled Cerngoth, and the boreal stillness that descended on the thronged streets of Leqquan, and the frost that seared with sudden whiteness the garths and orchards of the sea-fronting valley of Aguil. And sorrow was in his heart for the fishing-coracles and the biremes of trade and warfare that floated manless after they had met Yikilth.\n\nEver southward sailed the great iceberg, bearing its lethal winter to lands where the summer sun rode high. And Evagh kept his own counsel, and followed in all ways the custom of Dooni and Ux Loddhan and the others. At intervals that were regulated by the motions of the circumpolar stars, the eight wizards climbed to that lofty chamber in which Rlim Shaikorth abode perpetually, half-coiled on his dais of ice. There, in a ritual whose cadences corresponded to the falling of those eye-like tears that were wept by the worm, and with genuflections timed to the yawning and shutting of his mouth, they yielded to Rlim Shaikorth the required adoration. Sometimes the worm was silent, and sometimes he bespoke them, renewing vaguely the promises he had made. And Evagh learned from the others that the worm slept for a period at each darkening of the moon; and only at that time did the sanguine tears suspend their falling, and the mouth forbear its alternate closing and gaping.\n\nAt the third repetition of the rites of worship, it came to pass that only seven wizards climbed to the tower. Evagh, counting their number, perceived that the missing man was one of the five outlanders. Afterwards, he questioned Dooni and Ux Loddhan regarding this matter, and made signs of inquiry to the four northrons; but it seemed that the fate of the absent warlock was a thing mysterious to them all. Nothing was seen or heard of him from that time; and Evagh, pondering long and deeply, was somewhat disquieted. For, during the ceremony in the tower chamber, it had seemed to him that the worm was grosser of bulk and girth than on any prior occasion.\n\nCovertly he asked what manner of nutriment was required by Rlim Shaikorth. Concerning this, there was much dubiety and dispute: for Ux Loddhan maintained that the worm fed on nothing less unique than the hearts of white Arctic bears; while Dooni swore that his rightful nourishment was the liver of whales. But, to their knowledge, the worm had not eaten during their sojourn upon Yikilth; and both averred that the intervals between his times of feeding were longer than those of any terrestrial creature, being computable not in hours or days but in whole years.\n\nStill the iceberg followed its course, ever vaster and more prodigious beneath the heightening sun; and again, at the star-appointed time, which was the forenoon of every third day, the sorcerers convened in the presence of Rlim Shaikorth. To the perturbation of all, their number was now but six; and the lost warlock was another of the outlanders. And the worm had greatened still more in size; and the increase was visible as a thickening of his whole body from head to tail.\n\nDeeming these circumstances an ill augury, the six made fearful supplication to the worm in their various tongues, and implored him to tell them the fate of their absent fellows. And the worm answered; and his speech was intelligible to Evagh and Ux Loddhan and Dooni and the three northrons, each thinking that he had been addressed in his native language.\n\n\"This matter is a mystery concerning which ye shall all receive enlightenment in turn. Know this: the two that have vanished are still present; and they and ye also shall share even as I have promised in the ultramundane lore and empery of Rlim Shaikorth.\"\n\nAfterwards, when they had descended from the tower, Evagh and the two Thulaskians debated the interpretation of this answer. Evagh maintained that the import was sinister, for truly their missing companions were present only in the worm's belly; but the others argued that these men had undergone a more mystical translation and were now elevated beyond human sight and hearing. Forthwith they began to make ready with prayer and austerity, in expectation of some sublime apotheosis which would come to them in due turn. But Evagh was still fearful; and he could not trust the equivocal pledges of the worm; and doubt remained with him.\n\nSeeking to assuage his doubt and peradventure to find some trace of the lost Polarians, he made search of the mighty berg, on whose battlements his own house and the houses of the other warlocks were perched like the tiny huts of fishers on ocean-cliffs. In this quest the others would not accompany him, fearing to incur the worm's displeasure. From verge to verge of Yikilth he roamed unhindered, as if on some broad plateau with peaks and horns; and he climbed perilously on the upper scarps, and went down into deep crevasses and caverns where the sun failed and there was no other light than the strange luster of that unearthly ice. Embedded here in the walls, as if in the stone of nether strata, he saw dwellings such as men had never built, and vessels that might belong to other ages or worlds; but nowhere could he detect the presence of any living creature; and no spirit or shadow gave response to the necromatic evocations which he uttered oftentimes as he went along the chasms and chambers.\n\nSo Evagh was still apprehensive of the worm's treachery; and he resolved to remain awake on the night preceding the next celebration of the rites of worship; and at eve of that night he assured himself that the other wizards were all housed in their separate mansions, to the number of five. And, having ascertained this, he set himself to watch without remission the entrance of Rlim Shaikorth's tower, which was plainly visible from his own windows.\n\nWeird and chill was the shining of the berg in the darkness; for a light as of frozen stars was effulgent at all times from the ice. A moon that was little past the full arose early on the orient seas. But Evagh, holding vigil at his window till midnight, saw that no visible form emerged from the tall tower, and none entered it. At midnight there came upon him a sudden drowsiness, such as would be felt by one who had drunk some opiate wine; and he could not sustain his vigil any longer but slept deeply and unbrokenly throughout the remainder of the night.\n\nOn the following day there were but four sorcerers who gathered in the ice-dome and gave hommage to Rlim Shaikorth. And Evagh saw that two more of the outlanders, men of bulk and stature dwarfish beyond their fellows, were now missing.\n\nOne by one thereafter, on nights preceding the ceremony of worship, the companions of Evagh vanished. The last Polarian was next to go; and it came to pass that only Evagh and Ux Loddhan and Dooni went to the tower; and then Evagh and Ux Loddhan went alone. And terror mounted daily in Evagh, for he felt that his own time drew near; and he would have hurled himself into the sea from the high ramparts of Yikilth, if Ux Loddhan, who perceived his intention, had not warned him that no man could depart therefrom and live again in solar warmth and terrene air, having been habituated to the coldness and thin ether. And Ux Loddhan, it seemed, was wholly oblivious to his doom, and was fain to impute an esoteric significance to the ever-growing bulk of the white worm and the vanishing of the wizards.\n\nSo, at that time when the moon had waned and darkened wholly, it occurred that Evagh climbed before Rlim Shaikorth with infinite trepidation and loath, laggard steps. And, entering the dome with downcast eyes, he found himself to be the sole worshipper.\n\nA palsy of fear was upon him as he made obeisance; and scarcely he dared to lift his eyes and regard the worm. But even as he began to perform the customary genuflections, he became aware that the red tears of Rlim Shaikorth no longer fell on the purple stalagmites; nor was there any sound such as the worm was wont to make by the perpetual opening and shutting of his mouth. And venturing at last to look upward, Evagh beheld the abhorrently swollen mass of the monster, whose thickness was such as to overhang the dais' rim; and he saw that the mouth and eye-holes of Rlim Shaikorth were closed as if in slumber; and thereupon he recalled how the wizards of Thulask had told him that the worm slept for an interval at the darkening of each moon; which was a thing he had forgotten temporarily in his extreme dread and apprehension.\n\nNow was Evagh sorely bewildered, for the rites he had learned from his fellows could be fittingly performed only while the tears of Rlim Shaikorth fell down and his mouth gaped and closed and gaped again in measured alternation. And none had instructed him as to what rites were proper and suitable during the slumber of the worm. And, being in much doubt, he said softly:\n\n\"Wakest thou, O Rlim Shaikorth?\"\n\nIn reply, he seemed to hear a multitude of voices that issued obscurely from out the pale, tumid mass before him. The sound of the voices was weirdly muffled, but among them he distinguished the accents of Dooni and Ux Loddhan; and there was a thick muttering of outlandish words which Evagh knew for the speech of the five Polarians; and beneath this he caught, or seemed to catch, innumerable undertones that were not the voices of men or beasts, nor such sounds as would be emitted by earthly demons. And the voices rose and clamoured, like those of a throng of prisoners in some profound oubliette.\n\nAnon, as he listened in horror ineffable, the voice of Dooni became articulate above the others; and the manifold clamour and muttering ceased, as if a multitude were hushed to hear its own spokesman. And Evagh heard the tones of Dooni, saying:\n\n\"The worm sleepeth, but we whom the worm hath devoured are awake. Direly has he deceived us, for he came to our houses in the night, devouring us bodily one by one as we slept under the enchantment he had wrought. He has eaten our souls even as our bodies, and verily we are part of Rlim Shaikorth, but exist only as in a dark and noisome dungeon; and while the worm wakes we have no separate or conscious being, but are merged wholly in the ultraterrestrial being of Rlim Shaikorth.\n\n\"Hear then, O Evagh, the truth we have learned from our oneness with the worm. He has saved us from the white doom and has taken us upon Yikilth for this reason, because we alone of all mankind, who are sorcerers of high attainment and mastery, may endure the lethal ice-change and become breathers of the airless void, and thus, in the end, be made suitable for the provender of such as Rlim Shaikorth.\n\n\"Great and terrible is the worm, and the place wherefrom he cometh and whereto he returneth is not to be dreamt of by living men. And the worm is omniscient, save that he knows not the waking of them he has devoured, and their awareness during his slumber. But the worm, though ancient beyond the antiquity of worlds, is not immortal and is vulnerable in one particular. Whosoever learneth the time and means of his vulnerability and hath heart for this undertaking, may slay him easily. And the time for the deed is during his term of sleep. Therefore we adjure thee now by the faith of the Old Ones to draw the sword thou wearest beneath thy mantle and plunge it in the side of Rlim Shaikorth: for such is the means of his slaying.\n\n\"Thus alone, O Evagh, shall the going forth of the pale death be ended; and only thus shall we, thy fellow-sorcerers, obtain release from our blind thralldom and incarceration; and with us many that the worm hath betrayed and eaten in former ages and upon distant worlds. And only by the doing of this thing shalt thou escape the wan and loathly mouth of the worm, nor abide henceforward as a doubtful ghost among other ghosts in the evil blackness of his belly. But know, however, that he who slayeth Rlim Shaikorth must necessarily perish in the slaying.\"\n\nEvagh, being wholly astounded, made question of Dooni and was answered readily concerning all that he asked. A nd often-times the voice of Ux Loddhan replied to him; and sometimes there were unintelligible murmurs as outcries from certain others of those foully enmewed phantoms. Much did Evagh learn of the worm's origin and essence; and he was told the secret of Yikilth, and the manner wherein Yikilth had floated down from trans-Arctic gulfs to voyage the seas of Earth. Ever, as he listened, his abhorrence greatened: though deeds of dark sorcery and conjured devils had long indurated his flesh and soul, making him callous to more than common horrors. But of that which he learned it were ill to speak now.\n\nAt length there was silence in the dome; for the worm slept soundly, and Evagh had no longer any will to question the ghost of Dooni; and they that were imprisoned with Dooni seemed to wait and watch in a stillness of death.\n\nThen, being a man of much hardihood and resolution, Evagh delayed no more but drew from its ivory sheath the short but well-tempered sword of bronze which he carried always at his baldric. Approaching the dais closely, he plunged the blade in the over-swelling mass of Rlim Shaikorth. The blade entered easily with a slicing and tearing motion, as if he had stabbed a monstrous bladder, and was not stayed even by the broad pommel; and the whole right hand of Evagh was drawn after it into the wound.\n\nHe perceived no quiver or stirring of the worm, but out of the wound there gushed a sudden torrent of black liquescent matter, swiftening and deepening irresistibly till the sword was caught from Evagh's grasp as if in a mill-race. Hotter far than blood, and smoking with strange steam-like vapors, the liquid poured over his arms and splashed his raiment as it fell. Quickly the ice was a-wash about his feet; but still the fluid welled as if from some inexhaustible spring of foulness; and it spread everywhere in pools and runlets that came together.\n\nEvagh would have fled then; but the sable liquid, mounting and flowing, was above his ankles when he neared the stair-head; and it rushed adown the stairway before him like a cataract in some steeply pitching cavern. Hotter and hotter it grew, boiling, bubbling; while the current strengthened, and clutched at him and drew him like malignant hands. He feared to essay the downward stairs; nor was there any place now in all the dome where he could climb for refuge. He turned, striving against the tide for bare foothold, and saw dimly through the reeking vapours the throned mass of Rlim Shaikorth. The gash had widened prodigiously, and a stream surged from it like the waters of a broken weir, billowing outward around the dais; and yet, as if in further proof of the worm's unearthly nature, his bulk was in no wise diminished thereby. And still the black liquid came in an evil flood; and it rose swirling about the knees of Evagh; and the vapours seemed to take the forms of a myriad press of phantoms, wreathing obscurely together and dividing once more as they went past him. Then, as he tottered and grew giddy on the stair-head, he was swept away and was hurled to his death on the ice-steps far below.\n\nThat day, on the sea to eastward of middle Hyperborea, the crews of certain merchant galleys beheld an unheard-of thing. For, lo, as they sped north, returning from far ocean-isles with a wind that aided their oars, they sighted in the late forenoon a monstrous iceberg whose pinnacles and crags loomed high as mountains. The berg shone in part with a weird light; and from its loftiest pinnacle poured an ink-black torrent; and all the ice-cliffs and buttresses beneath were a-stream with rapids and cascades and sheeted falls of the same blackness, that fumed like boiling water as they plunged oceanward; and the sea around the iceberg was clouded and streaked for a wide interval as if with the dark fluid of the cuttlefish.\n\nThe mariners feared to sail closer; but, full of awe and marvelling, they stayed their oars and lay watching the berg; and the wind dropped, so that their galleys drifted within view of it all that day. They saw that the berg dwindled swiftly, melting as though some unknown fire consumed it; and the air took on a strange warmth, and the water about their ships grew tepid. Crag by crag the ice was runneled and eaten away; and huge portions fell off with a mighty splashing; and the highest pinnacle collapsed; but still the blackness poured out as from an unfathomable fountain. The mariners thought, at whiles, that they beheld houses running seaward amid the loosened fragments; but of this they were uncertain because of those ever-mounting vapours. By sunset-time the berg had dimished to a mass no larger than a common floe; yet still the welling blackness overstreamed it; and it sank low in the wave; and the weird light was quenched altogether. Thereafter, the night being moonless, it was lost to vision; and a gale rose, blowing strongly from the south; and at dawn the sea was void of any remnant.\n\nConcerning the matters related above, many and various legends have gone forth throughout Mhu Thulan and all the extreme Hyperboreal kingdoms and archipelagoes, even to the southmost isle of Oszhtror. The truth is not in such tales: for no man has known the truth heretofore. But I, the sorcerer Eibon, calling up through my necromancy the wave-wandering spectre of Evagh, have learned from him the veritable history of the worm's advent. And I have written it down in my volume with such omissions as are needful for the sparing of mortal weakness and sanity. And men will read this record, together with much more of the elder lore, in days long after the coming and melting of the great glacier."

        "content": "\n\nThe Lord Ralibar Vooz, high magistrate of Commoriom and third cousin to King Homquat, had gone forth with six-and-twenty of his most valorous retainers in quest of such game as was afforded by the black Eiglophian Mountains. Leaving to lesser sportsmen the great sloths and vampire-bats of the intermediate jungle, as well as the small but noxious dinosauria, Ralibar Vooz and his followers had pushed rapidly ahead and had covered the distance between the Hyperborean capital and their objective in a day's march. The glassy scaurs and grim ramparts of Mount Voormithadreth, highest and most formidable of the Eiglophians, had beetled above them, wedging the sun with dark scoriac peaks at mid-afternoon, and walling the blazonries of sunset wholly from view. They had spent the night beneath its lowermost crags, keeping a ceaseless watch, piling dead branches on their fires, and hearing on the grisly heights above them the wild and dog-like ululations of those subhuman savages, the Voormis for which the mountain was named. Also, they heard the bellowing of an alpine catoblepas pursued by the Voormis, and the mad snarling of a saber-tooth tiger assailed and dragged down; and Ralibar Vooz had deemed that these noises boded well for the morrow's hunting.\n\nHe and his men rose betimes; and having breakfasted on their provisions of dried bear-meat and a dark sour wine that was noted far its invigorative qualities, they began immediately the ascent of the mountain, whose upper precipices were hollow with caves occupied by the Voormis. Ralibar Vooz had hunted these creatures before; and a certain room of his house in Commoriom was arrased with their thick and shaggy pelts. They were usually deemed the most dangerous of the Hyperborean fauna; and the mere climbing of Voormithadreth, even without the facing of its inhabitants, would have been a feat attended by more than sufficient peril: but Ralibar Vooz, having tasted of such sport, could now satisfy himself with nothing tamer.\n\nHe and his followers were well armed and accoutered. Some of the men bore coils of rope and grapplinghooks to be employed in the escalade of the steeper crags. Some carried heavy crossbows; and many were equipped with long-handled and saber-bladed bills which, from experience, had proved the most effective weapons in close-range fighting with the Voormis. The whole party was variously studded with auxiliary knives, throwing-darts, two-handed simitars, maces, bodkins and saw-toothed axes. The men were all clad in jerkins and hose of dinosaur-leather, and were shod with brazen-spiked buskins. Ralibar Vooz himself wore a light suiting of copper chain-mail, which, flexible as cloth, in no wise impeded his movements. In addition he carried a buckler of mammoth-hide with a long bronze spike in its center that could be used as a thrusting-sword; and, being a man of huge stature and strength, his shoulders and baldric were hung with a whole arsenal of weaponries.\n\nThe mountain was of volcanic origin, though its four craters were supposedly all extinct. For hours the climbers toiled upward on the fearsome scarps of black lava and obsidian, seeing the sheerer heights above them recede interminably into a cloudless zenith, as if not to be approached by man. Far faster than they the sun climbed, blazing torridly uyon them and heating the rocks till their hands were scorched as if by the walls of a furnace. But Ralibar Vooz, eager to flesh his weapons, would permit no halting in the shady chasms nor under the scant umbrage of rare junipers.\n\nThat day, however, it seemed that the Voormis were not abroad upon Mount Voormithadreth. No doubt they had feasted too well during the night, when their hunting cries had been heard by the Commorians. Perhaps it would be necessary to invade the warren of caves in the loftier crags: a procedure none too palatable even for a sportsman of such hardihood as Ralibar Vooz. Few of these caverns could be reached by men without the use of ropes; and the Voormis, who were possessed of quasi-hunan cunning, would hurl blocks and rubble upon the heads of the assailants. Most of the caves were narrow and darksome, thus putting at a grave disadvantage the hunters who entered them; and the Voormis would fight redoubtably in defense of their young and their females, who dwelt in the inner recesses; and the females were fiercer and more pernicious, if possible, than the males.\n\nSuch matters as these were debated by RaHbar Vooz and his henchmen as the escalade became more arduous and hazardous, and they saw far above them the pitted mouths of the lower dens. Tales were told of brave hunters who had gone into those dens and had not returned; and much was said of the vile feeding-habits of the Voormis and the uses to which their csptives were put before death and after it. Also, much was said regarding the genesis of the Voormis, who were popularly believed to be the offspring of women and certain atrocious creatures that had come forth in primal days from a tenebrous cavern-world in the bowels of Voormithadreth. Somewhere beneath that four-coned mountain, the sluggish and baleful god Tsathoggua, who had come down from Saturn in years immediately foIlowing the Earth's creation, was fabled to reside; and during the rite of worship at his black altars, the devotees were always careful to orient thernselves toward Voormithadreth. Other and more doubtful beings than Tsathoggua slept below the extinct volcanoes, or ranged and ravened throughout that hidden underworld; but of these beings few men other than the more adept or abandoned wizards, professed to know anything at all.\n\nRalibar Vooz, who had a thoroughly modern disdain of the supernatural, avowed his skepticism in no equivocal terms when he heard his henchmen regaling each other with these antique legendries. He swore with many ribald blasphemies that there were no gods anywhere, above or under Voormithadreth. As for the Voormis themselves, they were indeed a misbegotten species; but it was hardly necessary, in explaining their generation, to go beyond the familiar laws of nature. They were merely the remnant of a low and degraded tribe of aborigines, who, sinking further into brutehood, had sought refuge in those volcanic fastnesses after the coming of the true Hyperboreans.\n\nCertain grizzled veterans of the party shook their heads and muttered at these heresies; but because of their respect for the high rank and prowess of Ralibar Vooz, they did oot venture to gainsay him openly.\n\nAfter several hoors of heroic climbing, the hunters came within measurable distance of those nether caves. Below them now, in a vast and dizzying prospect, were the wooded hills and fair, fertile plains of Hyperborea They were alone in a world of black, raven rock, with innumerable precipices and chasms above, beneath and on all sides. Directly overhead, in the face of an almost perpendicular cliff, were three of the cavern-mouths, which had the aspect of volcanic fumaroles. Much of the cliff was glazed with obsidian, and there were few ledges or hand-grips. It seemed that even the Voormis, agile as apes, could scarcely climb that wall; and Ralibar Vooz, after studying it with a strategic eye, decided that the only feasible approach to the dens was from above. A diagonal crack, running from a shelf just below them to the summit, no doubt afforded ingress and egress to their occupants.\n\nFirst, however, it was necessary to gain the precipice above: a difficult and precarious feat in itself. At one side of the long talus on which the hunters were standing, there was a chimney that wound upward in the wall, ceasing thirty feet from the top and leaving a sheer, smooth surface. Working along the chimney to its upper end, a good alpinist could hurl his rope and grappling-hook to the summit-edge.\n\nThe advisability af bettering their present vantage was now emphasized by a shower of stones and offal from the caverns. They noted certain human relics, wellgnawed and decayed, amid the offal. Ralibar Vooz, animated by wrath against these miscreants, as well as by the fervor of the huntsman, led his six-and-twenty followers in the escalade. He soon reached the chimney's termination, where a slanting ledge offered bare foothold at one side. After the third cast, his rope held; and he went up hand over hand to the precipice.\n\nHe found himself on a broad and comparatively leveltopped buttress of the lowest cone of Voormithadreth, which still rose for two thousand feet above him like a steep pyramid. Before him on the buttress, the black lava-stone was gnarled into numberless low ridges and strange masses like the pedestals of gigantic columns. Dry, scanty grasses and withered alpine flowers grew here and there in shallow basins of darkish soil; and a few cedars, levin-struck or stunted, had taken root in the fissured rock. Amid the black ridges, and seemingly close at hand, a thread of pale smoke ascended, serpentining oddly in the still air of noon and reaching an unbelievable height ere it vanished. Ralibar Vooz inferred that the buttress was inhabited by some person nearer to civilized humanity than the Voormis, who were quite ignorant of the use of fire. Surprised by this discovery, he did not wait for his men to join him, but started off at once to investigate the source of the curling smoke-thread.\n\nHe had deemed it merely a few steps away, behind the first of those grotesque furrows of lava. But evidently he had been deceived in this: for he climbed ridge after ridge and rounded many broad and curious dolmens and great dolomites which rose inexplicably before him where, an instant previous, he had thought there were only ordinary boulders; and still the pale, sinuous wisp went skyward at the same seeming interval.\n\nRalibar Vooz, high magistrate and redoubtable hunter, was both puzzled and irritated by this behavior of the smoke. Likewise, the aspect of the rocks around him was disconcertingly and unpleasantly deceitful. He was wasting too much time in an exploration idle and quite foreign to the real business of the day; but it was not his nature to abandon any enterprise no matter how trivial, without reaching the set goal. Halloing loudly to his men, who must have climbed the cliff by now, he went on toward the elusive smoke.\n\nIt seemed to him, once or twice, that he heard the answering shouts of his followers, very faint and indistinct, as if across some mile-wide chasm. Again he called lustily, but this time there was no audible reply. Going a little farther, he began to detect among the rocks beside him a peculiar conversational droning and muttering in which four or five different voices appeared to take part. Seemingly they were much nearer at hand than the smoke, which had now receded like a mirage. One of the voices was clearly that of a Hyperborean; but the others possessed a timbre and accent which Ralibar Vooz, in spite of his varied ethnic knowledge, could not associate with any branch or subdivision of mankind. They affected his ears in a most unpleasant fashion, suggesting by turns the hum of great insects, the murmurs of fire and water, and the rasping of metal.\n\nRalibar Vooz emitted a hearty and somewhat ireful bellow to announce his coming to whatever persons were convened amid the rocks. His weapons and accouterments clattering loudly, he scrambled over a sharp lava-ridge toward the voices.\n\nTopping the ridge, he looked down on a scene that was both mysterious and unexpected. Below him, in a circular hollow, there stood a rude hut of boulders and stone fragments roofed with cedar boughs. In front of this hovel, on a large flat block of obsidian, a fire burned with flanes alternately blue, green and white; and from it rose the pale, thin spiral of smoke whose situation had illuded him so strangely.\n\nAn old man, withered and disreputable-looking, in a robe that appeared no less antique and unsavory than himself, was standing near to the fire. He was not engaged in any visible culinary operations; and, in view of the torrid sun, it hardly seemed that he required the warmth given by the queer-colored blaze. Aside from this individual, Ralibar Vooz laoked in vain for the participants of the muttered conversation he had just overheard. He thought there was an evanescent fluttering of dim, grotesque, shadows around the obsidian block; but the shadows faded and vanished in an instant; and, since there were no objects or beings that could have cast them, Ralibar Vooz deemed that he had been victimized by another of those highly disagreeable optic illusions in which that part of the mountain Vormithadreth seemed to abound.\n\nThe old man eyed the hunter with a fiery gaze and began to curse him in fluent but somewhat archaic diction as he descended into the hollow. At the same time, a lizard-tailed and sooty-feathered bird, which seemed to belong to some night-flying species of archaeopteryx, began to snap its toothed beak and flap its digited wings on the objectionably shapen stela that served it for a perch. This stela, standing on the lee side of the fire and very close to it, had not been perceived by Ralibar Vooz at first glance.\n\n\"May the ordure of demons bemire you from heel to crown!\" cried the venomous ancient. \"O lumbering, bawling idiot! you have ruined a most promising and important evocation. How you came here I cannot imagine. I have surrounded this place with twelve circles of illusion, whose effect is multiplied by their myriad intersections; and the chance that any intruder would ever find his way to my abode was mathematically small and insignificant. Ill was that chance which brought you here: for They that you have frightened away will not return until the high stars repeat a certain rare and quickly passing conjunction; and much wisdom is lost to me in the interim.\"\n\n\"How now, varlet!\" said Ralibar Vooz, astonished and angered by this greeting, of which he understood little save that his presence was unwelcome to the old man. \"Who are you that speak so churlishly to a magistrate of Commoriom and a cousin to King Homquat? I advise you to curb such insolence: for, if so I wish, it lies in my power to serve you even as I serve the Voormis. Though methinks,\" he added, \"your pelt is far too filthy and verminous to merit room amid my trophies of the chase.\"\n\n\"Know that I am the sorcerer Ezdagor,\" proclaimed the ancient, his voice echoing among the rocks with dreadful sonority. \"By choice I have lived remote from cities and men; nor have the Voormis of the mountain troubled me in my magical seclusion. I care not if you are the magistrate of all swinedom or a cousin to the king of dogs. In retribution for the charm you have shattered, the business you have undone by this oafish trespass, I shall put upon you a most dire and calamitous and bitter geas.\"\n\n\"You speak in terms of outmoded superstition,\" said Ralibar Vooz, who was impressed against his will by the weighty oratorical style in which Ezdagor had delivered these periods.\n\nThe old man seemed not to hear him.\n\n\"Harken then to your geas, O Ralibar Vooz,\" he fulminated. \"For this is the geas, that you must cast aside all your weapons and go unarmed into the dens of the Voormis; and fighting bare-handed against the Voormis and against their females and their young, you must win to that secret cave in the bowels of Voormithadreth, beyond the dens, wherein abides from eldermost eons the god Tsathoggua. You shall know Tsathoggua by his great girth and his batlike furriness and the look of a sleepy black toad which he has eternally. He will rise not from his place, even in the ravening of hunger, but will wait in divine slothfulness for the sacrifice. And, going close to Lord Tsathoggua, you must say to him: \"I am the blood-offering sent by the sorcerer Ezdagor.' Then, if it be his pleasure, Tsathoggua will avail himself of the offering.\n\n\"In order that you may not go astray, the bird Raphtontis, who is my familiar. will guide you in your wanderings on the mountain-side and through the caverns.\" He indicated with a peculiar gesture the night-flying archaeopteryx on the foully symbolic stela, and added as if in afterthought: \"Raphtontis will remain with you till the accomplishnent of the geas and the end of your journey below Voormithadreth. He knows the secrets of the underworld and the lairing-places of the Old ones. If our Lord Tsathoggoa should disdain the blood-offering, or, in his generosity, should send you on to his brethern, Raphtontis will be fully competent to lead the way whithersoever is ordained by the god.\"\n\nRalibar Vooz found himself unable to answer this more than outrageous peroration in the style which it manifestly deserved. In fact, he could say nothing at all: for it seemed that a sort of lockjaw had afflicted him. Moreover, to his exceeding terror and bewilderment, this vocal paralysis was accompanied by certain involuntary movements of a most alarming type. With a sense of nightmare compulsion, together with the horror of one who feels that he is going mad, he began to divest himself of the various weapons which he carried. His bladed buckler, his mace, broadsword, hunting-knife, ax and needle-tipped anlace jingled on the ground before the obsidian block.\n\n\"I shall permit you to retain your helmet and bodyarmor,\" said Ezdagor at this juncture. \"Otherwise, I fear that you will not reach Tsathoggua in the state of corporeal intactness proper for a sacrifice. The teeth and nails of the Voormis are sharp, even as their appetites.\"\n\nMuttering certain half-inaudible and doubtful-sounding words, the wizard turned from Ralibar Vooz and began to quench the tri-colored fire with a mixture of dust and blood from a shallow brass basin. Deigning to vouchsafe no farewell or sign of dismissal, he kept his back toward the hunter, but waved his left hand obliquely to the bird Raphtontis. This creature, stretching his murky wings and clacking his saw-like beak, abandoned his perch and hung poised in air with one ember-colored eye malignly fixed on Ralibar Vooz. Then, floating slowly, his long snakish neck reverted and his eye maintaining its vigilance, the bird flew among the lava-ridges toward the pyramidal cone of Voormithadreth; and Ralibar Vooz followed, driven by a compulsion that he could neither understand nor resist.\n\nEvidently the demon fowl knew all the turnings of that maze of delusion with which Ezdagor had environed his abode; for the hunter was led with comparatively little indirection across the enchanted buttress. He heard the far-off shouting of his men as he went; but his own voice was faint and thin as that of a flittermouse when he sought to reply. Soon he found himself at the bottom of a great scrap of the upper mountain, pitted with cavern-mouths. It was a part of Voormithadreth that he had never visited before.\n\nRaphtontis rose toward the lowest cave, and hovered at its entrance while Ralibar Vooz climbed precariously behind him amid a heavy barrage of bones and glassedged flints and other oddments of less mentionable nature hurled by the Voormis. These low, brutal savages, fringing the dark mouths of the dens with their repulsive faces and members, greeted the hunter's progress with ferocious howlings and an inexhaustible supply of garbage. However, they did not molest Raphtontis, and it seemed that they were anxious to avoid hitting him with their missiles; though the presence of this hovering, wide-winged fowl interfered noticeably with their aim as Ralibar Vooz began to near the nethermost den.\n\nOwing to this partial protection, the hunter was able to reach the cavern without serious injury. The entrance was rather strait; and Raphtontis flew upon the Voormis with open beak and flapping wings, compelling them to withdraw into the interior while Ralibar Vooz made firm his position on the threshold-ledge. Some, however, threw themselves on their faces to allow the passage of Raphtontis; and, rising when the bird had gone by, they assailed the Commorian as he followed his guide into the fetid gloom. They stood only half erect, and their shaggy heads were about his thighs and hips, snarling and snapping like dogs; and they clawed him with hook-shaped nails that caught and held in the links of his armor.\n\nWeaponless he fought them in obedience to his geas, striking down their hideous faces with his mailed fist in a veritable madness that was not akin to the ardor of a huntsman. He felt their nails and teeth break on the close-woven links as he hurled them loose; but others took their places when he won onward a little into the murky cavern; and their females struck at his legs like darting serpents; and their young beslavered his ankles with mouths wherein the fangs were as yet ungrown.\n\nBefore him, for his guidance, he heard the clanking of the wings of Raphtontis, and the harsh cries, half hiss and half caw, that were emitted by this bird at intervals. The darkness stifled him with a thousand stenches; and his feet slipped in blood and filth at every step. But anon he knew that the Voormis had ceased to assail him. The cave sloped downward; and he breathed an air that was edged with sharp, acrid mineral odors. Groping for a while through sightless night, and descending a steep incline, he came to a sort of underground hall in which neither day or darkness prevailed. Here the archings of rock were visible by an obscure glow such as hidden moons might yield. Thence, through declivitous grottoes and along perilously skirted gulfs, he was conducted ever downward by Raphtontis into the world beneath the mountain Voormithadreth. Everywhere was that dim, unnatural light whose source he could not ascertain. Wings that were too broad for those of the bat flew vaguely overhead; and at whiles, in the shadowy caverns, he beheld great, fearsome bulks having a likeness to those behemoths and giant reptiles which burdened the Earth in earlier times, but because of the dimness he could not tell if these were living shapes or forms that the stone had taken.\n\nStrong was the compulsion of his geas on Ralibar Vooz; and a numbness had seized his mind; and he felt only a dulled fear and a dazed wonder. It seemed that his will and his thoughts were no longer his own, but were become those of some alien person. He was going down to some obscure but predestined end, by a route that was darksome but foreknown.\n\nAt last the bird Raphtontis paused and hovered significantly in a cave distinguished from the others by a most evil potpourri of smells. Ralibar Vooz deemed at first that the cave was empty. Going forward to join Raphtontis, he stumbled over certain attenuated remnants on the Boor, which appeared to be the skin-clad skeletons of men and various animals. Then, following the coal-bright gaze of the demon bird, he discerned in a dark recess the formless bulking of a couchant mass. And the mass stirred a little at his approach, and put forth with infinite slothfulness a huge and toad-shaped head. And the head opened its eyes very slightly, as if half awakened from slumber, so that they were visible as two slits of oozing phosphor in the black, browless face.\n\nRalibar Vooz perceived an odor of fresh blood amid the many fetors that rose to besiege bis nostrils. A horror came upon him therewith; for, looking down, he beheld lying before the shadowy monster the lean husk of a thing that was neither man, beast nor Voormi. He stood hesitant, fearinig to go closer yet powerless to retreat. But, admonished by an angry hissing from the archaeopteryx, together with a slashing stroke of its beak between his shoulder-blades, he went forward till he could see the fine dark fur on the dormant body and sleepily porrected head.\n\nWith new horror, and a sense of hideous doom, he heard his own voice speaking without volition: \"O Lord Tsathaggua, I am the blood-offering sent by the sorcerer Ezdagor.\"\n\nThere was a sluggish inclination of the toad-like head; and the eyes opened a little wider, and light flowed from them in viscous tricklings on the creased underlids. Then Ralibar Vooz seemed to hear a deep, rumbling sound; bat he knew not whether it reverberated in the dusky air or in his own mind. And the sound shaped itself, albeit uncouthly, into syllables and words:\n\n\"Thanks are due to Ezdagor for this offering. But, since I have fed lately on a well-blooded sacrifice, my hunger is appeased for the present, and I require not the offering. However, it may be that others of the Old Ones are athirst or famished. And, since you came here with a geas upon you, it is not fitting that you should go hence without another. So I place you under this geas, to betake yourself downward through the caverns till you reach, after long descent, that bottomless gulf over which the spider-god Atlach-Nacha weaves his eternal webs. And there, calling to AtlachNacha, you must say: 'I am the gift sent by Tsathoggua.'\"\n\nSo, with Raphtontis leading him, Ralibar Vooz departed from the presence of Tsathoggua by another route than that which had brought him there. The way steepened more and more; and it ran through chambers that were too vast for the searching of sight; and along precipices that fell sheer for an unknown distance to the black, sluggish form and somnolent murmur of underworld seas.\n\nAt last, on the verge of a chasm whose farther shore was lost in darkness, the night-flying bird hung motionless with level wings and down-dropping tail. Ralibar Vooz went close to the verge and saw that great webs were attached to it at intervals, seeming to span the gulf with their multiple crossing and reticulations of gray, rope thick strands. Apart from these, the chasm was bridgeless. Far out on one of the webs he discerned a darksome form, big as a crouching man but with long spider-like members. Then, like a dreamer who hears some nightmare sound, he heard his own voice crying loudly: \"O Atlach-Nacha, I am the gift sent by Tsathoggua.\"\n\nThe dark form ran toward him with incredible swiftness. When it came near he saw that there was a kind of face on the squat ebon body, low down amid the several-jointed legs. The face peered up with a weird expression of doubt and inquiry; and terror crawled through the veins of the bold huntsman as he met the small, crafty eyes that were circled about with hair. Thin, shrill, piercing as a sting, there spoke to him the voice of the spider-god Atlach-Nacha: \"I am duly gratefui for the gift. But, since there is no one else to bridge this chasm, and since eternity is required for the task, I can not spend my time in extracting you from those curious shards of metal. However, it may be that the antehuman sorcerer Haon-Dor, who abides beyond the gulf in his palace of primal enchantments, can somehow find a use for you. The bridge I have just now completed runs to the threshold of his abode; and your weight will serve to test the strength of my weaving. Go then, with this geas upon yeu, to cross the bridge and present yourself before Haon-Dor, saying: 'Atlach-Nacha has sent me.'\"\n\nWith these words, the spider-god withdrew his bulk from the web and ran quickly from sight along the chasm-edge, doubtless to begin the construction of a new bridge at some remoter point.\n\nThough the third geas was heavy and compulsive upon him, Ralibar Vooz followed Raphtontis none too willingly over the night-bound depths. The weaving of Atlach-Nacha was strong beneath his feet, giving and swaying only a little; but between the strands, in unfathomable space below, he seemed to descry the dim flitting of dragons with claw-tipped wings; and, like a seething of the darkness, fearful hulks without name appeared to heave and sink from moment to noment.\n\nHowever, he and his guide came presently to the gulf's opposite shore, where the web of Atlach-Nacha was joined to the lowest step of a mighty stairway. The stairs were guarded by a coiled snake whose mottlings were broad as buckles.and whose middle volumes exceeded in girth the body of a stout warrior. The horny tail of this serpent rattled like a sistrum, and he thrust forth an evil head with fangs that were long as billhooks. But, seeing Raphtontis, he drew his coils aside and permitted Ralibar Vaoz to ascend the steps.\n\nThus, in fulfilment of the third geas, the hunter entered the thousand-columned palace of Haon-Dor. Strange and silent were those halls hewn from the gray, fundamental rock of Earth. In them were faceless forms of smoke and mist that went uneasily to and fro, and statues representing monsters with myriad heads. In the vaults above, as if hung aloof in night, lamps burned with inverse flames that were like the combustion of ice and stone. A chill spirit of evil, ancient beyond all conception of man, was abroad in those halls; and horror and fear crept throughout them like invisible serpents, unknotted from sleep.\n\nThreading the mazy chambers with the surety of one accustomed to all their windings, Raphtontis conducted Ralibar Vooz to a high room whose walls described a circle. broken only by the one portal, through which he entered. The room was empty of furnishment, save for a five-pillared seat rising so far aloft without stairs or other means of approach, that it seemed only a winged being covld ever attain thereto. But on the seat was a figure shrouded with thick, sable darkness, and having over its head and features a caul of grisly shadow.\n\nThe bird Raphtontis hovered ominously before the columned chair. And Ralibar Vooz, in astonishment, heard a voice saying: \"O Haon-Dor, Atlach-Nacha has sent me.\" And not till the voice ceased speaking did he know it for his own.\n\nFor a long time the silence seemed infrangible. There was no stirring of the high-seated figure. But Ralibar Vooz, peering trepidantly at the walls about him, beheld their former smoothness embossed with a thousand faces, twisted and awry like those of mad devils. The faces were thrust forward on necks that lengthened; and behind the necks malshapen shoulders and bodies emerged inch by inch from the stone, craning toward the huntsman. And beneath his feet the very floor was now cobbled with other faces, turning and tossing restlessly, and opening ever wider their demoniacal mouths and eyes.\n\nAt last the shrouded figure spoke; and though the words were of no mortal tongue, it seemed to the listener that he comprehended them darkly:\n\n\"My thanks are due to Atlach-Nacha for this sending. If I appear to hesitate, it is only because I am doubtful regarding what disposition I can make of you. My familiars, who crowd the walls and floors of this chamber, would devour you all too readily: but you would serve only as a morsel amid so many. On the whole, I believe that the best thing I can do is to send you on to my allies, the serpent-people. They are scientists of no ordinary attainment; and perhaps you might provide some special ingredient required in their chemistries. Consider, then, that a geas has been put upon you, and take yourself off to the caverns in which the serpent-people reside.\"\n\nObeying this injunction, Ralibar Vooz went down through the darkest strata of that primeval underworld, beneath the palace of Haon-Dor, The guidance of Raphtontis never failed him; and he came anon to the spacious caverns in which the serpent-men were busying themselves with a multitude of tasks. They walked lithely and sinuously erect on pre-mammalian members, their pied and hairless bodies bending with great suppleness. There was a loud and constant hissing of formulae as they went to and fro. Some were smelting the black nether ores; some were blowing molten obsidian into forms of flask and urn; some were measuring chemicals; others were decanting strange liquids and curious colloids. In their intense preoccupation, none of them seemed to notice the arrival of Ralibar Vooz and his guide.\n\nAfter the hunter had repeated many times the message given him by Haon-Dor, one of the walking reptiles at last perceived his presence. This being eyed him with cold but highly disconcerting curiosity, and then emitted a sonorous hiss that was audible above all the noises of labor and converse. The other serpentmen ceased their toil imnediately and began to crowd around Ralibar Vooz. From the tone of their sibilations, it seemed that there was much argument among them. Certain of their number sidled close to the Commorian, touching his face and hands with their chill, scaly digits, and prying beaeath his armor. He felt that they were anatomizing him with methodical minuteness. At the same time, he perceived that they paid no attention to Raphtontis, who had perched himself on a large alembic.\n\nAfter a while, some of the chemists went away and returned quickly, bearing among them two great jars of glass filled with a clear liquid. In one of the jars there floated upright a well-developed and mature male Voormi; in the other, a large and equally perfect specimen of Hyperborean manhood, not without a sort of general likeness to Ralibar Vooz himself. The bearers of these specimens deposited their burdens beside the hunter and then each of them delivered what was doubtless a learned dissertation on comparative biology.\n\nThis series of lectures, unlike many such, was quite brief. At the end the reptilian chemists returned to their various labors, and the jars were removed. One of the scientists then addressed himself to Ralibar Vooz with a fair though somewhat sibilant approximation of human speech:\n\n\"It was thoughtful of Haon-Dor to send you here. However, as you have seen, we are already supplied with an exemplar of your species; and, in the past, we have thorougbly dissected others and have learned all that there is to learn regarding this very uncouth and aberrant life-form.\n\n\"Also, since our chemistry is devoted almost wholly to the production of powerful toxic agents, we can find no use in our tests and manufactures for the extremely ordinary matters of which your body is composed. They are without pharmaceutic value. Moreover, we have long abandoned the eating of impure natural foods, and now confine ourselves to synthetic types of aliment. There is, as you must realize, no place for you in our economy.\n\n\"However, it may be that the Archetypes can somehow dispose of you. At least you wiH be a novelty to them, since no example of contenporary human evolution has so far descended to their stratum. Therefore we shall put you under that highly urgent and imperative kind of hypnosis which, in the parlance of warlockry, is known as a geas. And, obeying the hypnosis, you wiE go down to the Cavern of the Archetypes...\"\n\nThe region to which the magistrate of Commoriom was now conducted lay at some distance below the ophidian laboratories. The air of the gulfs and grottoes along his way began to increase markedly in warmth, and was moist and steamy as that of some equatorial fen. A primordial luminosity, such as might have dawned befare the creation of any sun, seemed to surround and pervade everything.\n\nAll about him, in this thick and semi-aqueous light, the hunter discerned the rocks and fauna and vegetable forms of a crassly primitive world. These shapes were dim, uncertain, wavering, and were all composed of loosely organized elements. Even in this bizarre and more than doubtful terrain of the under-Earth, Raphtontis seemed wholly at home, and he flew on amid the sketchy plants and cloudy-looking boulders as if at no loss whatever in orienting himself. But Ralibar Vooz, in spite of the spell that stimulated and compelled him onward, had begun to feel a fatigue by no means unnatural in view of his prolonged and heroic itinerary. Also, he was much troubled by the elasticity of the ground, which sank beaeath him at every step like an oversodded marsh, and seemed insubstantial to a quite alarming degree.\n\nTo his further disconcertion, he soon found that he had attracted the attention of a huge foggy monster with the rough outlines of a tyrannosaurus. This creature chased him amid the archetypal ferns and clubmosses; and overtaking him after five or six bounds, it proceeded to ingest him with the celerity of any latter-day saurian of the same species. Luckily, the ingestment was not permanent for the tyrannosaurus' body-plasm, though fairly opaque, was more astral than material; and Ralibar Vooz, protesting stoutly against his confinement in its maw, felt the dark walls give way before him and tumbled out on the ground. After its third attempt to devour him, the monster must have decided that he was inedible. It turned and went away with immense leapings in search of comestibles on its own plane of matter. Ralibar Vooz concontinued his progress through the Cavern of the Archetypes: a progress often delayed by the alimentary designs of crude, misty-stomached allosaurs, pterodactyls, pterandons, stegosaurs, and other carnivora of the prime. At last, following his experience with a most persistent megalosaur, he beheld before him two entities of vaguely human outline. They were gigantic, with bodies almost globular in form, and they seemed to float rather than walk. Their features, though shadowy to the point of inchoateness, appeared to express aversion and hostility. They drew near to the Commorian, and he became aware that one of them was addressing him. The language used was wholly a matter of primitive vowel-sounds; but a meaning was forcibly, though indistinctly, conveyed:\n\n\"We, the originals of mankind, are dismayed by the sight of a copy so coarse and egregiously perverted from the true model. We disown you with sorrow and indignation. Your presence here is an unwarrantable intrusion; and it is obvious that you are not to be assimilated even by our most esurient dinosaurs. Therefore we put you under a geas: depart without delay fmm the Cavern of the Archetypes, and seek out the slimy gulf in which Abhoth, father and mother of all cosmic uncleanness, eternally carries on Its repugnant fission. We consider that you are fit only for Abhoth, which will perhaps mistake you for one of Its own progeny and devour you in accordance with the custom which It follows.\"\n\nThe weary hunter was led by the untirable Raphtontis to a deep cavern on the same level as that of the Archetypes. Possibly it was a kind of annex to the latter. At any rate, the ground was much firmer there, even though the air was murkier; and Ralibar Vooz might have recovered a little of his custonary aplomb, if it had not been for the ungodly and disgusting creatures which he soon began to meet. There were things which he could liken only to monstrous one-legged toads, and immense myriad-tailed worms, and miscreated lizards. They came flopping or crawling through the gloom in a ceaseless procession; and there was no end to the loathsome morphologic variations which they displayed. Unlike the Archetypes, they were formed of all too solid matter, and Ralibar Vooz was both fatigued and nauseated by the constant necessity of kicking them away from his shins. He was somewhat relieved to find, however, that these wretched abortions became steadily smaller as he continued his advance.\n\nThe dusk about him thickened with hot, evil steam that left an oozy deposit on his armor and bare face and hands. With every breath he inhaled an odor noisome beyond imagining. He stumbled and slipped on the crawling foulnesses underfoot. Then, in that reeky twilight, he saw the pausing of Raphtontis; and below the demoniac bird he descried a sort of pool with a margin of mud that was marled with obscene offal; and in the pool a grayish, horrid mass that nearly choked it from rim to rim.\n\nHere, it seemed, was the ultimate source of all miscreation and abomination. For the gray mass quobbed and quivered, and swelled perpetually; and from it, in manifold fission, were spawned the anatomies that crept away on every side through the grotto. There were things like bodiless legs or arms that flailed in the slime, or heads that rolled, or floundering bellies with fishes' fins; and all manner of things malformed and monstrous, that grew in size as they departed from the neigbborhood of Abhoth. And those that swam not swiftly ashore when they fell into the pool from Abhoth, were devoured by mouths that gaped in the parent bulk.\n\nRalibar Vooz was beyond thought, beyond horror, in his weariness: else he would have known intolerable shame, seeing that he had come to the bourn ordained for him by the Archetypes as most fit and proper. A deadness near to death was upon his faculties; and he heard as if remote and high above him a voice that proclaimed to Abhoth the reason of his coming; and he did not know that the voice was his own.\n\nThere was no sound in answer; but out of the lumpy mass there grew a member that stretched and lengthened tovrard Ralibar Vopz where he stood waiting on the pool's margin. The nember divided to a flat, webby hand, soft and slimy, which touched the hunter and went over his person slowly from foot to head. Having done this, it seemed that the thing had served its use: for it dropped quickly away from Abhoth and wriggled into the gloom like a serpent together with the other progeny.\n\nStill waiting, RaHbar Vooz felt in his brain a sensation as of speech heard without words or sound. And the import, rendered in human language, was somewhat as follows:\n\n\"I, who am Abhoth, the coeval of the oldest gods, consider that the Archetypes have shown a questionable taste in recommending you to me. After careful inspection, I fail to recognize you as one of my relatives or progeny; though I must admit that I was nearly deceived at first by certain biologic similarities. You are quite alien to my experience; and I do not care to endanger my digestion with untried articles of diet. \"\n\n\"Who you are, or whence you have corne, I can not surmise; nor can I thank the Archetypes for troubling the profound and placid fertility of my existence with a problem so vexatious as the one that you offer. Get hence, I adjure you. There is a bleak and drear and dreadful limbo, known as the Outer World, of which I have heard dimly; and I think that it might prove a suitable objective for your journeying. I settle an urgent geas upon you: go seek this Outer World with all possible expedition.\"\n\nApparently Raphtontis realized that it was beyond the physical powers of his charge to fulfill the seventh geas without an interim of repose. He led the hunter to one of the numerous exits of the grotto inhabited by Abhoth: an exit giving on regions altogether unknown, opposite to the Cavern of the Archetypes. There, with significant gestures of his wings and beak, the bird indicated a sort of narrow alcove in the rock, The recess was dry and by no means uncomfortable as a sleeping-place. Ralibar Vooz was glad to lay himself down; and a black tide of slumber rolled upon him with the closing of his eyelids. Raphtontis remained on guard before the alcove, discouraging with strokes of his bill the wandering progeny of Abhoth that tried to assail the sleeper.\n\nSince there was neither night nor day in that subterrene world, the term of oblivion enjoyed by Ralibar Vooz was hardly to be measured by the usual method of time-telling. He was aroused by the noise of vigorously flapping wings, and saw beside him the fowl Raphtontis, holding in his beak an unsavory object whose anatomy was that of a fish rather than anything else. Where or how he had caught this creature during his constant vigil was a more than dubious matter; but Ralibar Vooz had fasted too long to be squeamish. He accepted and devoured the proffered breakfast without ceremony.\n\nAfter that, in conformity with the geas laid upon him by Abhoth, he resumed his journey back to the outer Earth. The route chosen by Raphtontis was presumably a short-cut. Anyhow, it was remote from the cloudy cave of the Archetypes, and the laboratories in which the serpent-men pursued their arduous toils and toxicological researches. Also, the enchanted palace of Haon-Dor was omitted from the itinerary. But, after long, tedious climbing through a region of desolate crags and over a sort of underground plateau, the traveller came once more to the verge of that farstretching, bottomless chasm which was bridged only by the webs of the spider-god Atlach-Nacha.\n\nFor some time past he had hurried his pace because of certain of the progeny of Abhoth, who had followed him from the start and had grown steadily bigger after the fashion of their kind, till they were now large as young tigers or bears. However, when he approached the nearest bridge, he saw that a ponderous and slothlike entity, preceding him, had already begun to cross it. The posteriors of this being was studded with unamiable eyes, and Ralibar Vooz was unsure for a little regarding its exact orientation. Not wishing to tread too closely upon the reverted talons of its heels, he waited till the monster had disappeared in the darkness; and by that time the spawn of Abhoth were hard upon him.\n\nRaphtontis, with sharp admonitory cawings, floated before him above the giant web; and he was impelled to a rash haste by the imminently slavering snouts of the dark abnormalities behind. Owing to such precipitancy, he failed to notice that the web had been weakened and some of its strands torn or stretched by the weight of the sloth-like monster. Coming in view of the chasm's opposite verge, he thought only of reaching it, and redoubled his pace. But at this point the web gave way beneath him. He caught wildly at the broken, dangling strands, but could not arrest his fall. With several pieces of Atlach-Nacha's weaving clutched in his fingers, he was precipitated into that gulf which no one had ever voluntarily tried to plumb.\n\nThis, unfortunately, was a contingency that had not been provided against by the terms of the seventh geas.",

"拉利巴尔·沃兹大人，科摩里奥姆的最高法官，国王霍姆夸特的第三代表亲，率领二十六名最勇猛的随从出发，前往黑色艾格洛菲安山脉狩猎。他将丛林中的巨型树懒、吸血蝙蝠以及虽小却凶险的恐龙留给那些次等猎手，自己则带着队伍迅速推进，仅用一日行程便跨越了极北之都与目标间的距离。沃米萨德雷斯山——艾格洛菲安山脉中最高峻可怖的峰峦——那玻璃般光滑的峭壁与阴森的壁垒在他们头顶森然耸立，午后三时将太阳楔入幽暗的火山岩尖峰之间，彻底遮蔽了晚霞的绚烂天幕。他们在最底层的巉岩下过夜，保持着不间断的警戒，向篝火堆叠枯枝，同时聆听着上方可怖高处传来的非人蛮族——那些令此山得名的沃米斯人——如野犬般凄厉的嚎叫。他们还听见高山猫蜥被沃米斯人追猎时的怒吼，以及剑齿虎遭袭倒地时的疯狂嘶鸣；拉利巴尔·沃兹认为这些声响预示着次日狩猎的吉兆。\n\n他与部下黎明即起，以干熊肉和以提神功效著称的酸黑葡萄酒果腹后，立即开始攀登这座上层悬崖布满沃米斯巢穴的火山。拉利巴尔·沃兹曾猎杀过这些生物；他在科摩里奥姆宅邸的某间厅堂里挂满了它们粗厚蓬乱的毛皮。它们通常被视为极北之地最危险的兽群；即便不考虑其住民，仅攀登沃米萨德雷斯山本身就已是危机四伏的壮举：但尝过这种狩猎滋味的拉利巴尔·沃兹，如今已对更温驯的猎物提不起兴致。\n\n他与随从们全副武装。有人携带绳钩用于攀越陡崖，有人扛着沉重弩机，更多人配备长柄钩镰——经验证明这是与沃米斯近身搏斗最有效的武器。整支队伍还佩有各式副武器：飞镖、双手弯刀、钉头锤、锥刺与锯齿战斧。众人皆着恐龙皮短衣绑腿，足蹬铜钉高筒靴。拉利巴尔·沃兹本人则穿着柔若布帛的铜链甲，丝毫不妨碍行动。他另持一面猛犸皮圆盾，中央嵌有可作刺剑的长铜钉；这位魁梧巨汉的肩带还挂满整套兵器库。\n\n这座火山虽四座喷口皆已沉寂，攀登者仍在可怖的黑色熔岩与黑曜石断崖上艰苦攀援数小时。上方峭壁无止境地延伸至无云的天顶，仿佛拒人千里。烈日飞速爬升，灼烤着他们，将岩石炙热如熔炉壁。但急于让兵器见血的拉利巴尔·沃兹，不许队伍在阴凉裂隙或稀疏刺柏的微荫下停歇。\n\n然而当日沃米斯人似乎未在沃米萨德雷斯山活动。显然这些蛮族前夜饱餐后正在休憩。或许必须攻入高层洞穴群——即便对拉利巴尔·沃兹这般悍勇的猎手而言也非乐事。多数洞穴需绳索方能抵达；而具备类人狡诈的沃米斯人，会向入侵者投掷碎石。幽暗狭窄的洞穴令猎手处于极端劣势；沃米斯人则会死守巢穴深处更凶残的雌性与幼崽。\n\n随着攀登愈发艰险，猎手们开始争论这些风险。他们讲述着有去无回的勇者传说，谈论沃米斯令人作呕的食性，以及俘虏生前死后遭受的折磨。更有人提及沃米斯起源的秘闻——据传是远古时期人类女性与某类来自沃米萨德雷斯山腹黑暗洞窟的可怖生物杂交所生。传说自创世之初从土星降临的怠惰邪神撒托古亚，就蛰伏在这四锥山某处；信徒朝拜其黑祭坛时总面向此山。除撒托古亚外，还有更多可疑存在沉睡于死火山下，或游荡在那幽暗地底世界——唯有最堕落或最精研的巫师才略知一二。\n\n拉利巴尔·沃兹以现代人的傲慢嗤笑这些传说。他用下流亵语发誓沃米萨德雷斯山上下绝无神明。至于沃米斯人，他坚称不过是退化的土著残余。\n\n队伍中某些灰须老兵对此异端邪说摇头低语，但碍于拉利巴尔·沃兹的权势与威名，未敢公开反驳。\n\n历经数小时英勇攀登，猎手们逼近下层洞穴群。此刻他们置身于黑色玄武岩的孤绝世界，上下四周皆是令人眩晕的悬崖深壑。正上方近乎垂直的崖面有三个火山喷气孔状的洞口。即便猿猴般敏捷的沃米斯人也难攀此壁；拉利巴尔·沃兹判断唯一通路是自上方经一道斜向裂隙进入。\n\n然而首先需攀上悬崖本身——这已是危险壮举。猎队所在岩屑堆侧方有处烟囱状裂隙，止于距顶三十尺的光滑断面。优秀登山者可在此抛掷绳钩。\n\n此时洞中倾泻而下的碎石与腐渣突显了转移的必要。秽物中可见被啃噬的人类残骸。怒火中烧的拉利巴尔·沃兹率众攀援，很快抵达裂隙尽头，在第三次抛掷后固定绳索，徒手攀上崖顶。\n\n他发现自己站在沃米萨德雷斯山最低锥体宽阔平坦的基岩上，上方两千尺锥峰仍如陡峭金字塔耸立。面前黑色熔岩扭曲成无数矮脊与巨柱基座般的奇形岩体。干枯的稀薄草丛与高山花卉点缀着暗色土洼，几株遭雷击或发育不良的雪松扎根岩缝。近处黑色山脊间，一缕苍白烟丝诡谲地蜿蜒入静止的正午空气，升至难以置信的高度后消散。拉利巴尔·沃兹推断此地基居者比不懂用火的沃米斯人更接近文明。他未等部下会合便独自前去探查。\n\n烟源看似仅隔数步，实则每翻越一道熔岩垄脊，就有更多诡奇岩碑莫名浮现。苍白烟缕始终保持着看似不变的距离。这位以果决著称的猎手被这戏弄激怒，不顾徒劳探索已耽误正事，仍固执追寻。他几次隐约听见部下回应，却如隔万丈深渊。再呼唤时已无回音。\n\n前行不久，他察觉身侧岩石传来奇特低语，似有四五个声音参与。这些声响比已退如蜃景的烟缕更近。其一声确系极北之民，余者音色却令见多识广的拉利巴尔·沃兹无法归类——时而似巨虫嗡鸣，时而若水火私语，间杂金属刮擦之声。\n\n他喝令现身，兵器铿锵地翻越熔岩脊。展现在眼前的一幕既诡谲又出人意料：下方圆形洼地中，矗立着以雪松枝为顶的粗陋石屋。屋前黑曜石台上燃烧着蓝绿白三色火焰，苍白烟丝正是源于此。\n\n一位形容枯槁、衣袍比本人更古旧腌臜的老者立于火旁。酷暑中燃此异色火焰显然非为取暖。拉利巴尔·沃兹遍寻不着方才低语的参与者，只瞥见黑曜石台周围有模糊怪影倏忽消逝——这无源之影令他怀疑又是沃米萨德雷斯山常见的视觉骗局。\n\n老者以燃烧般的目光瞪视猎人，用流利但古旧的辞藻咒骂这位闯入者。同时，一只尾似蜥蜴、羽呈烟色的始祖鸟形生物，在火堆旁畸形石柱上磨喙振翅——拉利巴尔·沃兹初未注意此柱。\n\n\"愿恶魔秽物从头到脚玷污汝！\"恶毒老者厉声道，\"蠢笨喧哗的白痴！汝毁了一场至关重要的召唤仪式。此地布有十二重幻象结界，万道交错增幅，闯入几率微乎其微。汝之到来实属不幸：被汝惊走的彼等，需待星象重现稀有组合时方会归来，期间吾将损失大量智慧。\"\n\n\"放肆！\"拉利巴尔·沃兹又惊又怒，虽不解其意却知不受欢迎，\"吾乃科摩里奥姆大法官、霍姆夸特王表亲！汝这污秽老朽的毛皮连当我战利品的资格都没有！\"\n\n\"吾乃巫师埃兹达格。\"老者声音在岩壁间激起骇人回响，\"自愿远离尘世隐居于此，沃米斯人亦不敢扰吾清修。为惩戒汝破坏仪式之罪，吾将降下最严酷的诅咒。\"\n\n拉利巴尔·沃兹虽不情愿，仍被其威严辞令所慑。老者继续道：\"听好了，拉利巴尔·沃兹。汝须弃械赤手深入沃米斯巢穴，穿越其雌性与幼崽的防线，抵达沃米萨德雷斯山腹中撒托古亚神栖息的秘洞。那形如瞌睡黑蟾蜍的毛茸茸胖神祇，纵使饥肠辘辘亦懒于起身。汝需近前言：'吾乃埃兹达格献祭之血食。'若合其意，撒托古亚自会享用。\"\n\n\"吾之使魔拉弗托尼斯将引汝穿越山腹迷宫。\"他指向石柱上那始祖鸟，\"它知晓古神巢穴奥秘。若撒托古亚不屑此祭或转赠同族，它亦能带汝前往命定之地。\"\n\n拉利巴尔·沃兹突觉口不能言，更恐怖的是身体开始不受控制地卸下武装。随着噩梦般的强制感，他陆续抛落圆盾、钉锤、阔剑、猎刀、战斧与锥刺。\n\n\"准汝保留头盔铠甲。\"埃兹达格补充，\"否则恐难保祭品完整。沃米斯人的爪牙与食欲同样锋利。\"\n\n巫师转身用铜盆中的血灰混合物熄灭三色火焰，左手向使魔示意。那丑恶怪鸟展开烟色羽翼，以余烬般的独眼盯视猎人，缓缓飞向主峰。拉利巴尔·沃兹在无法理解也无法抗拒的力量驱使下，跟随而去。\n\n怪鸟似乎深谙幻象迷阵的每处转折，很快带他穿越被施法的基岩区。远方部下的呼喊渐弱如蝙蝠吱喳。最终他们来到一处陌生崖底，洞口密布如蜂窝。这是拉利巴尔·沃兹从未涉足的区域。\n\n拉夫托尼斯振翅飞向最底层的洞穴，在洞口盘旋等候。此时拉利巴尔·沃兹正艰难地攀爬其后，沃米斯人投掷的碎骨、燧石片及其他难以名状的秽物如暴雨般倾泻而下。这些低等野蛮生物用他们可憎的面孔与肢体挤满幽暗洞口，以凶残嚎叫与无穷无尽的污秽之物\"欢迎\"猎人的到来。奇怪的是，他们对拉夫托尼斯秋毫无犯，甚至刻意避开这只巨鸟投掷——尽管这双不断扑扇的宽翼确实严重干扰了他们的准头，尤其当拉利巴尔·沃兹即将抵达最底层洞穴时。\n\n得益于这微妙的庇护，猎人最终带着轻伤抵达洞口。狭窄的入口处，拉夫托尼斯突然张喙扑向沃米斯人，迫使这些生物退入洞穴深处，让拉利巴尔·沃兹得以在岩架站稳脚跟。几个俯身避让巨鸟的沃米斯人旋即跃起，在猎人跟随向导踏入腐臭黑暗时发起突袭。这些半直立的生物蓬乱头颅仅及猎人腰胯，犬吠般撕咬着，钩状趾甲死死扣住他铠甲的铁环。\n\n受制于誓约的猎人徒手搏斗，覆甲的铁拳疯狂击碎那些丑恶面孔——这癫狂与猎人的勇武截然不同。他能感觉到利齿与趾甲在密集锁甲上崩断的震颤，但每击退一波攻击，就有更多怪物从幽暗洞穴涌出。雌性沃米斯像毒蛇般噬咬他的双腿，幼崽们用未生獠牙的嘴濡湿他的脚踝。\n\n前方传来拉夫托尼斯翅膀的铿锵声与间歇发出的嘶哑鸣叫，半似蛇嘶半似鸦啼。千种恶臭窒息的黑暗里，他每一步都踩在血污中打滑。当沃米斯人停止攻击时，洞穴开始向下倾斜。尖锐的矿物气息刺入鼻腔，在伸手不见五指的陡坡摸索许久后，他来到一处昼夜不分的洞厅。岩穹笼罩在隐秘月光般的幽光中，拉夫托尼斯引领他穿过倾斜的洞窟，沿着险峻的深渊边缘，不断深入沃米萨德雷斯山脉下的世界。无处不在的诡谲光源里，蝙蝠翼膜过宽的生物在头顶盘旋，阴影中隐约浮现的巨兽轮廓仿若上古巨兽，但昏暗光线使人无法分辨那是活物还是石像。\n\n誓约的强制力使拉利巴尔·沃兹神智麻木，仅存钝化的恐惧与恍惚。他的意志仿佛被某个异质存在占据，正沿着既定的黑暗路径，迈向某个晦暗而命定的终点。\n\n最终拉夫托尼斯在一处恶臭扑鼻的洞窟悬停。猎人起初以为洞穴空无一物，直到被地表的干瘪残骸绊倒——那些披着人皮与兽皮的枯骨。顺着魔鸟炽炭般的视线，他在黑暗壁龛里看到一团无定形的匍匐阴影。那团阴影微微蠕动，以极致的迟缓探出蟾蜍状的巨大头颅。头颅半睁睡眼，无眉的漆黑面孔上，两道渗着磷光的细缝缓缓显现。\n\n在围攻鼻腔的恶臭中，拉利巴尔·沃兹嗅到了新鲜血气。低头看见阴影巨怪前那具非人非兽的干瘪皮囊时，恐惧攫住了他。魔鸟在肩胛骨间的啄击迫使他向前，直至看清休眠躯体上细密的黑毛与昏睡伸出的头颅。\n\n伴随着难以言喻的恐怖与毁灭预感，他听见自己的声音不受控制地响起：\"伟大的撒托古亚，我是巫师艾兹达戈尔献上的血祭。\"\n\n蟾首慵懒地点动，眼缝渗出粘稠流光。低沉轰鸣不知来自幽暗空气还是他脑海，最终扭曲成可辨的词句：\"且代我谢过艾兹达戈尔。不过刚享用过血祭，眼下倒无进食欲望。但其他古神或许饥渴——既然你带着誓约而来，也该带着新的誓约离开。\"声音为猎人烙下新的诅咒：穿越无尽洞窟，直至蜘蛛之神阿特拉克·纳克亚编织永恒蛛网的深渊，并宣告：\"我是撒托古亚的赠礼。\"\n\n拉夫托尼斯引领他另寻出路。愈发陡峭的路径穿过视野难及的巨室，沿着未知深度的悬崖，下方传来黑色潜流与地底海的昏沉呢喃。\n\n最终夜行鸟在无底深渊边缘悬停。灰色绳粗蛛网纵横交错构成唯一桥梁。远处蛛网上蹲伏着人形黑影，却生着蜘蛛的长肢。猎人听见自己不受控制地高喊：\"阿特拉克·纳克亚，我是撒托古亚的赠礼！\"\n\n黑影以不可思议的速度逼近。当它靠近时，猎人看见乌黑躯干的多关节长腿间嵌着一张脸。狡黠的环毛小眼带着诡异的疑虑仰视，令勇猛猎人的血管冻结。蜘蛛之神尖细刺耳的声音响起：\"我领受这份馈赠。但永恒织网工程紧迫，无暇剥开你这金属外壳。或许原始魔宫中的先人类巫师哈恩·多尔能用得上你。新建的蛛网直通他的居所——你的重量正好测试编织强度。带着这个誓约过去吧，告诉哈恩·多尔：'阿特拉克·纳克亚遣我前来。'\"\n\n蜘蛛之神说完便沿深渊边缘消失，显然要去更远处架设新桥。尽管第三重誓约沉重如枷，拉利巴尔·沃兹仍跟随拉利巴尔·沃兹踏上蛛网。脚下编织物仅微微晃动，但在无底虚空间的绳隙里，他瞥见爪翼巨龙的幽影，以及黑暗中无名巨物沉浮的轮廓。\n\n抵达彼岸时，蛛网连接着宏伟阶梯的底端。盘踞的巨蛇鳞片宽如带扣，腰身胜过壮硕武士。角质尾发出叉铃般的声响，它探出长如钩镰的毒牙，但看见拉夫托尼斯后便退开让路。\n\n于是猎人履行第三誓约，踏入哈恩·多尔千柱之宫。灰色原生岩凿成的厅堂寂静诡谲，无面雾影徘徊其间，多头怪兽的雕像林立。穹顶悬挂的冰焰石灯散发着超越人类理解的古老恶意，恐惧如解缚的隐蛇爬满每个角落。\n\n拉夫托尼斯熟稔地带他来到圆形高厅。无阶梯的五柱王座高不可攀，唯有翼族方能抵达。王座上笼罩着浓黑阴影的身影头戴恐怖影膜。当猎人听见自己说出\"哈恩·多尔，阿特拉克·纳克亚遣我前来\"时，惊觉声音竟出自自己之口。\n\n漫长寂静后，光滑墙壁突然凸现千张扭曲魔脸。石中伸出蜿蜒脖颈与畸形躯体，地板上翻涌着张牙瞪眼的恶魔面孔。最终阴影中的存在用非人语言说道：\"我领受这份馈赠。犹豫只因不知如何处置你。我的眷族会迫不及待分食你，但这不过杯水车薪。不如将你送给蛇人盟友——他们的炼金术或需特殊素材。\"\n\n于是猎人深入蛇人巢穴。这些史前生物灵活摆动着无毛身躯，嘶鸣着公式穿梭于熔铸黑矿、吹制黑曜石器皿的工坊间。多次重复哈恩·多尔的口信后，终于有蛇人注意到他。它们用鳞爪探查他的铠甲，随后取来两罐液体标本：一罐悬浮着发育成熟的沃米斯雄性，另一罐是与他形貌相近的极北人。短暂\"学术讨论\"后，蛇人用带着嘶声的人语宣布：\"哈恩·多尔多此一举。我们早已解剖过你这类生物。况且现代人类的肉体既无药用价值，也不符合我们合成食物的标准。或许原型族能处置你——毕竟尚无当代人类抵达过他们的地层。\"\n\n在通往原型族洞穴的湿热隧道里，原始微光笼罩一切，仿佛创世前的曙光。蛇人为他烙下最后的誓约，猎人即将面对那些自太初以来便潜伏在地心深处的、不可名状的存在。\n\n在这浓稠如半液态的光线中，猎人辨认出周围粗粝原始的岩石与动植物形态。这些轮廓模糊不定、摇曳扭曲，全由松散聚合的元素构成。即便在这诡异得令人难以置信的地下国度，拉夫托提斯也如鱼得水，在潦草勾勒的植物与云雾状巨岩间穿行，方向感丝毫不乱。但拉利巴尔·沃兹虽受咒语驱使前行，却因漫长艰险的旅程而疲惫不堪——这疲惫来得再自然不过。更令他不安的是脚下富有弹性的地面，每踏一步都如浸水沼泽般下陷，那触感虚无得令人心惊。\n\n更令他惶恐的是，他很快发现自己引起了某种形似霸王龙的雾状巨兽注意。这生物在原始蕨类与石松间追逐他，五六次腾跃后便将他吞入腹中——与后世同类捕食时如出一辙的迅捷。所幸这吞噬并非永久，那霸王龙虽身躯凝实，构造却更接近星质体。当拉利巴尔·沃兹在它喉间奋力挣扎时，黑暗的腔壁竟在他面前瓦解，使他跌回地面。第三次尝试失败后，巨兽认定他不可食用，转身以惊人的跳跃离去，寻找更合胃口的猎物。拉利巴尔·沃兹继续穿越原型洞穴的旅程，却屡屡被雾胃暴龙、翼手龙、翼龙、剑龙等原始掠食者当作美餐耽搁。最终，当摆脱某只执着至极的巨齿龙后，他眼前浮现两道模糊人形。\n\n这两个存在身形巨硕如球体，飘行而非行走。它们朦胧得近乎混沌的面容上，分明透着憎恶与敌意。当它们逼近科摩里安人时，其中一位开始发声——那语言仅由原始元音构成，却强行传递出晦涩的讯息：\n\n\"作为人类原型，我们惊骇于眼前这粗劣扭曲的复制品。我们以悲愤与你划清界限。你的存在是对此地的亵渎，连最贪婪的恐龙都不愿消化你。现对你施加禁制：立即离开原型洞穴，前往万秽之源阿布霍斯栖息的粘腻深渊。你只配被阿布霍斯错认为子嗣吞食——这本就是它的习性。\"\n\n精疲力竭的猎人在不知疲倦的拉夫托提斯引领下，来到与原型洞穴同层的深窟。此处地面坚实许多，但空气中游荡着令人作呕的生物：独腿蟾蜍、千尾巨虫、畸形蜥蜴。它们以令人窒息的形态变异从黑暗中涌出，与原型生物不同，这些污秽造物有着过于实在的肉体。拉利巴尔·沃兹不得不持续踢开爬过胫骨的怪物，直到发现它们随深入而逐渐缩小。\n\n湿热毒雾在盔甲与裸露皮肤上凝结成黏液，每次呼吸都吸入难以想象的恶臭。当他在黏滑地面上踉跄时，看见拉夫托提斯停在某处——下方是漂浮着秽物的泥潭，潭中灰白肿胀的肉块几乎塞满整个池子。\n\n这便是万般畸变的源头。那团灰色肉块永恒颤动着膨胀，通过裂殖产出爬向四面八方的畸形生物：无躯四肢在粘液中拍打、头颅滚动、鱼鳍腹肚挣扎......所有造物都在远离阿布霍斯时逐渐巨大化。而那些未能及时游走的，则被母体上突然裂开的巨口吞噬。\n\n疲惫已使拉利巴尔·沃兹超越恐惧与思考，否则他该为自己被原型生物判定\"最适宜归宿\"而感到羞耻。当近乎死亡的麻木笼罩他时，一个声音向阿布霍斯宣告来意——他并未意识到那是自己的声音。\n\n回应他的是一根从肉块延伸出的肢端，分裂成湿滑蹼掌抚过他全身。完成检视后，这肢体如蛇般扭入黑暗。接着他脑中响起无声之语：\n\n\"我，阿布霍斯，与古神同寿，认为原型生物的推荐品味可疑。你虽具某些生物相似性，却非我血裔。鉴于消化未知食物的风险，我命令你前往传闻中名为'地表世界'的荒寂边境——这便是我施加的禁制。\"\n\n拉夫托提斯似乎意识到猎人需要休整，便将他引至岩壁凹室。当拉利巴尔·沃兹沉入黑潮般的睡眠时，怪鸟以喙击退企图袭击的秽物子嗣。\n\n在这无昼夜的地下世界，猎人被振翅声惊醒，看见拉夫托提斯衔着条怪鱼——尽管难以想象它如何捕得。饥肠辘辘的拉利巴尔·沃兹毫不犹豫地吞下这顿早餐。\n\n遵循阿布霍斯的禁制，他们踏上归途。这条捷径避开了原型洞穴与蛇人实验室，也未经过豪恩多尔魔宫。但当他们穿越荒芜岩区，再次来到蛛神阿特拉克·纳克亚的巨网深渊时，尾随的秽物子嗣已壮大如虎熊。\n\n先行踏上蛛网的迟缓巨怪使网丝松动断裂。急于摆脱追兵的拉利巴尔·沃兹未察觉危险，在临近对岸时坠入无人敢探的深渊——第七道禁制终究未能护他周全。"

        "title": "The End of the Story",
        "content": "\n\nThe following narrative was found among the papers of Christophe Morand, a young law-student of Tours, after his unaccountable disappearance during a visit at his father's home near Moulins, in November, 1798:\n\nA sinister brownish-purple autumn twilight, made premature by the imminence of a sudden thunderstorm, had filled the forest of Averoigne. The trees along my road were already blurred to ebon masses, and the road itself, pale and spectral before me in the thickening gloom, seemed to waver and quiver slightly, as with the tremor of some mysterious earthquake. I spurred my horse, who was woefully tired with a journey begun at dawn, and had fallen hours ago to a protesting and reluctant trot, and we galloped adown the darkening road between enormous oaks that seemed to lean toward us with boughs like clutching fingers as we passed.\n\nWith dreadful rapidity, the night was upon us, the blackness became a tangible clinging veil; a nightrnare confusion and desperation drove me to spur my mount again with a more cruel rigor; and now, as we went, the first far-off mutter of the storm mingled with the clatter of my horse's hoofs, and the first lightning flashes illumed our way, which, to my amazement (since I believed myself on the main highway through Averoigne), had inexplicably narrowed to a well-trodden footpath. Feeling sure that I had gone astray, but not caring to retrace my steps in the teeth of darkness and the towering clouds of the tempest, I hurried on, hoping, as seemed reasonable, that a path so plainly worn would lead eventually to some house or chateau. where I could find refuge for the night. My hope was wellfounded, for within a few minutes I descried a glimmering light through the forest-boughs, and came suddenly to an open glade, where, on a gentle eminence, a large building loomed, with several litten windows in the lower story, and a top that was well-nigh indistinguishable against the bulks of driven cloud.\n\n'Doubtless a monastery,' I thought, as I drew rein, and descending from my exhausted mount, lifted the heavy brazen knocker in the form of a dog's head and let it fall on the oaken door. The sound was unexpectedly loud and sonorous, with a reverberation almost sepulchral, and I shivered involuntarily, with a sense of startlement, of unwonted dismay. This, a moment later, was wholly dissipated when the door was thrown open and a tall, ruddyfeatured monk stood before me in the cheerful glow of the cressets that illumed a capacious hallway.\n\n'I bid you welcome to the abbey of Perigon,' he said, in a suave rumble, and even as he spoke, another robed and hooded figure appeared and took my horse in charge. As I murmured my thanks and acknowledgments, the storm broke and tremendous gusts of rain, accompanied by evernearing peals of thunder, drove with demoniac fury on the door that had closed behind me.\n\n\"It is fortunate that you found us when you did,\" observed my host. \"Twere ill for man and beast to be abroad in such a hell-brew.\"\n\nDivining without question that I was hungry as well as tired, he led me to the refectory and set before me a bountiful meal of mutton, brown bread, lentils and a strong excellent red wine.\n\nHe sat opposite me at the refectory table while I ate, and, with my hunger a little mollifed, I took occasion to scan him more attentively. He was both tall and stoutly built, and his features, where the brow was no less broad than the powerful jaw, betokened intellect as well as a love for good living. A certain delicacy and refinement, an air of scholarship, of good taste and good breeding, emanated from him, and I thought to myself: 'This monk is probably a connoisseur of books as well as of wines.' Doubtless my expression betrayed the quickening of my curiosity, for he said, as if in answer:\n\n'I am Hilaire, the abbot of Perigon. We are a Benedictine order, who live in amity with God and with all men, and we do not hold that the spirit is to be enriched by the mortification or impoverishment of the body. We have in our butteries an abundance of wholesome fare, in our cellars the best and oldest vintages of the district of Averoigne. And, if such thiags interest you, as mayhap they do, we have a library that is stocked with rare tomes, with precious manuscripts, with the finest works of heathendom and Christendom, even to certain unique writings that survived the holocaust of Alexandria.'\n\n'I appreciate your hospitality,' I said, bowing. 'I am Christophe Morand, a law-student, on my way home from Tours to my father's estate near Moulins. I, too, am a lover of books, and nothing would delight me more than the privilege of inspecting a library so rich and curious as the one whereof you speak.'\n\nForthwith, while I finished my meal, we fell to discussing the classics, and to quoting and capping passages from Latin, Greek or Christian authors. My host, I soon discovered, was a scholar of uncommon attainments, with an erudition, a ready familiarity with both ancient and modern literature that made my own seem as that of the merest beginner by comparison. He, on his part, was so good as to commend my far from perfect Latin, and by the time I had emptied my bottle of red wine we were chatting familiarly like old friends.\n\nAll my fatigue had now flown, to be succeeded by a rare sense of well-being, of physical comfort combined with mental alertness and keenness. So, when the abbot suggested that we pay a visit to the library, I assented with alacrity.\n\nHe led me down a long corridor, on each side of which were cells belonging to the brothers of the order, and unlocked, with a huge brazen key that depended from his girdle, the door of a great room with lofty ceiling and several deep-set windows. Truly, he had not exaggerated the resources of the library; for the long shelves were overcrowded with books, and many volumes were piled high on the tables or stacked in corners. There were rolls of papyrus, of parchment, of vellum; there were strange Byzantine or Coptic bibles; there were old Arabic and Persian manuscripts with floriated or jewel-studded covers; there were scores of incunabula from the first printing-presses; there were innumerable monkish copies of antique authors, bound in wood or ivory, with rich illuminations and lettering that was often in itself a work of art.\n\nWith a care that was both loving and meticulous, the abbot Hilaire brought out volume after volume for my inspection. Many of them I had never seen before; some were unknown to me even by fame or rumor. My excited interest, my unfeigned enthusiasm, evidently pleased him, for at length he pressed a hidden spring in one of the library tables and drew out a long drawer, in which, he told me, were certain treasures that he did not care to bring forth for the edification or delectation of many, and whose very existence was undreamed of by the monks.\n\n'Here,' he continued, 'are three odes by Catullus which you will not find in any published edition of his works. Here, also, is an original manuscript of Sappho — a complete copy of a poem otherwise extant only in brief fragments; here are two of the lost tales of Miletus, a letter of Perides to Aspasia, an unknown dialogue of Plato and an old Arabian work on astronomy, by some anonymous author, in which the theories of Copernicus are anticipated. And, lastly, here is the somewhat infamous Histoire d'Amour, by Bernard de Vaillantcoeur, which was destroyed immediately upon publication, and of which only one other copy is known to exist.'\n\nAs I gazed with mingled awe and curiosity on the unique, unheard-of treasures he displayed, I saw in one corner of the drawer what appeared to be a thin volume with plain untitled binding of dark leather. I ventured to pick it up, and found that it contained a few sheets of ciosely written manuscript in old French.\n\n'And this?' I queried, turning to look at Hilaire, whose face, to my amazement, had suddenly assumed a melancholy and troubled expression.\n\n'It were better not to ask, my son.' He crossed himself as he spoke, and his voice was no longer mellow, but harsh, agitated, full of a sorrowful perturbation. 'There is a curse on the pages that you hold in your hand: an evil spell, a malign power is attached to them, and he who would venture to peruse them is henceforward in dire peril both of body and soul.' He took the little volume from me as he spoke, and returned it to the drawer, again crossing himself carefully as he did so.\n\n'But, father,' I dared to expostulate, 'how can such things be? How can there be danger in a few written sheets of parchment?'\n\n'Christophe, there are things beyond your understanding, things that it were not well for you to know. The might of Satan is manifestable in devious modes, in diverse manners; there are other temptations than those of the world and the flesh, there are evils no less subtle than irresistible, there are hidden heresies, and necromancies other than those which sorcerers practise.'\n\n'With what, then, are these pages concerned, that such occult peril, such unholy power lurks within them?'\n\n'I forbid you to ask.' His tone was one of great rigor, with a finality that dissuaded me from further questioning.\n\n'For you, my son,' he went on, 'the danger would be doubly great, because you are young, ardent, full of desires and curiosities. Believe me, it is better to forget that you have ever seen this manuscript.' He closed the hidden drawer, and as he did so, the melancholy troubled look was replaced by his former benignity.\n\n'Now,' he said, as he turned to one of the book-shelves, 'I will show you the copy of Ovid that was owned by the poet Petrarch.' He was again the mellow scholar, the kindly, jovial host, and it was evident that the mysterious manuscript was not to be referred to again. But his odd perturbation, the dark and awful hints he had let fall, the vague terrific terms of his proscription, had all served to awaken my wildest curiosity, and, though I felt the obsession to be unreasonable, I was quite unable to think of anything else for the rest of the evening. All manner of speculations, fantastic, absurd, outrageous, ludicrous, terrible, defiled through my brain as I duly admired the incunabula which Hilaire took down so tenderly from the shelves for my delectation.\n\nAt last, toward midnight, he led me to my room — a room especially reserved for visitors, and with more of comfort, of actual luxury in its hangings, carpets and deeply quilted bed than was allowable in the cells of the monks or of the abbot himself. Even when Hilaire had withdrawn, and I had proved for my satisfaction the softness of the bed allotted me, my brain still whirled with questions concerning the forbidden manuscript. Though the storm had now ceased, it was long before I fell asleep; but slumber, when it finally came, was dreamless and profound.\n\nWhen I awoke, a river of sunshine clear as molten gold was pouring through my wmdow. The storm had wholly vanished, and no lightest tatter of cloud was visible anywhere in the pale-blue October heavens. I ran to the window and peered out on a world of autumnal forest and fields all a-sparkle with the diamonds of rain. All was beautiful, all was idyllic to a degree that could be fully appreciated only by one who had lived for a long time, as I had, within the walls of a city, with towered buildings in lieu of trees and cobbled pavements where grass should be. But, charming as it was, the foreground held my gaze only for a few moments; then, beyond the tops of the trees, I saw a hill, not more than a mile distant, on whose summit there stood the ruins of some old chateau, the crumbling, brokendown condition of whose walls and towers was plainly visible. It drew my gaze irresistibly, with an overpowering sense of romantic attraction, which somehow seemed so natural, so inevitable, that I did not pause to analyze or wonder; and once having seen it, I could not take my eyes away, but lingering at the window for how long I knew not, scrutinizing as closely as I could the details of each timeshaken turret and bastion. Some undefinable fascination was inherent in the very form, the extent, the disposition of the pile — some fascination not dissimilar to that exerted by a strain of music, by a magical combination of words in poetry, by the features of a beloved face. Gazing, I lost myself in reveries that I could not recall afterward, but which left behind them the same tantalizing sense of innominable delight which forgotten nocturnal dreams may sometimes leave.\n\nI was recalled to the actualities of life by a gentle knock at my door, and realized that I had forgotten to dress myself. It was the abbot, who came to inquire how I had passed the night, and to tell me that breakfast was ready whenever I should care to arise. For some reason, I felt a little embarrassed, even shamefaced, to have been caught day-dreaming; and though this was doubtless unnecessary, I apologized for my dilatoriness. Hilaire, I thought, gave me a keen, inquiring look, which was quickly withdrawn, as, with the suave courtesy of a good host, he assured me that there was nothing whatever for which I need apologize.\n\nWhen I had breakfast, I told Hilaire, with many expressions of gratitude for his hospitality, that it was time for me to resume my journey. But his regret at the announcement of my departure was so unfeigned, his invitation to tarry for at least another night was so genuinely hearty, so sincerely urgent, that I consented to remain. In truth, I required no great amount of solicitation, for, apart from the real liking I had taken to Hilaire, the mystery of the forbidden manuscript had entirely enslaved my imagination, and I was loth to leave without having learned more concerning it. Also, for a youth with scholastic leanings, the freedom of the abbot's library was a rare privilege, a precious opportunity not to be passed over.\n\n'I should like,' I said, 'to pursue certain studies while I am here, with the aid of your incomparable collection.'\n\n'My son, you are more than welcome to remain for any length of time, and you can have access to my books whenever it suits your need or inclination.' So saying, Hilaire detached the key of the library from his girdle and gave it to me. 'There are duties,' he went on, 'which will call me away from the monastery for a few hours today, and doubtless you will desire to study in my absence.'\n\nA little later, he excused himself and departed. With inward felicitations on the longed-for opportunity that had fallen so readily into my hands, I hastened to the library, with no thought save to read the proscribed manuscript. Giving scarcely a glance at the laden shelves, I sought the table with the secret drawer, and fumbled for the spring. After a little anxious delay, I pressed the proper spot and drew forth the drawer. An impulsion that had become a veritable obsession, a fever of curiosity that bordered upon actual madness, drove me, and if the safety of my soul had really depended upon it, I could not have denied the desire which forced me to take from the drawer the thin volume with plain unlettered binding.\n\nSeating myself in a chair near one of the windows, I began to peruse the pages, which were only six in number. The writing was peculiar, with letter-forms of a fantasticality I had never met before, and the French was not only old but well-night barbarous in its quaint singularity. Notwithstanding the difficulty I found in deciphering them, a mad, unaccountable thrill ran through me at the first words, and I read on with all the sensations of a man who had been bewitched or who had drunken a philtre of bewildering potency.\n\nThere was no title, no date, and the writing was a narrative which began almost as abruptly as it ended. It concerned one Gerard, Comte de Venteillon, who, on the eve of his marriage to the renowned and beautiful demoiselle, Eleanor des Lys, had met in the forest near his chateau a strange, half-human creature with hoofs and horns. Now Gerard, as the narrative explained, was a knightly youth of indisputably proven valor, as wdl as a true Christian; so, in the name of our Savior, Jesus Christ, he bade the creature stand and give an account of itself.\n\nLaughing wildly in the twilight, the bizarre being capered before him, and cried:\n\n'I am a satyr, and your Christ is less to me than the weeds that grow on your kitchen-middens.'\n\nAppalled by such blasphemy, Gerard would have drawn his sword to slay the creature, but again it cried, saying:\n\n'Stay, Gerard de Venteillon, and I will tell you a secret, knowing which, you will forget the worship of Christ, and forget your beautiful bride of tomorrow, and turn your back on the world and on the very sun itself with no reluctance and no regret.'\n\nNow, albeit half uawillingly, Gerard lent the satyr an ear and it came closer and whispered to him. And that which it whispered is not known; but before it vanished amid the blackening shadows of the forest, the satyr spoke aloud once more, and said:\n\n'The power of Christ has prevailed like a black frost on all the woods, the fields, the rivers, the mountains, where abode in their felicity the glad, immortal goddesses and nymphs of yore. But still, in the cryptic caverns of earth, in places far underground, like the hell your priests have fabled, there dwells the pagan loveliness, there cry the pagan ecstasies.' And with the last words, the creature laughed again its wild unhuman laugh, and disappeared among the darkening boles of the twilight trees.\n\nFrom that moment, a change was upon Gerard de Venteillon. He returned to his chateau with downcast mien, speaking no cheery or kindly word to his retainers, as was his wont, but sitting or pacing always in silence, and scarcely heeding the food that was set before him. Nor did he go that evening to visit his betrothed, as he had promised; but, toward midnight, when a waning moon had arisen red as from a bath of blood, he went forth clandestinely by the postern door of the chateau, and followed an old, halfobliterated trail through the woods, found his way to the ruins of the Chateau des Faussesflammes, which stands on a hill opposite the Benedictine abbey of Perigon.\n\nNow these ruins (said the manuscript) are very old, and have long been avoided by the people of the district; for a legendry of immemorial evil clings about them, and it is said that they are the dwelling-place of foul spirits, the rendezvous of sorcerers and succubi. But Gerard, as if oblivious or fearless of their ill renown, plunged like one who is devil-driven into the shadow of the crumbling walls, and went, with the careful-groping of a man who follows some given direction, to the northern end of the courtyard. There, directly between and below the two centermost windows, which, it may be, looked forth from the chamber of forgotten chatelaines, he pressed with his right foot on a flagstone differing from those about it in being of a triangular form. And the flagstone moved and tilted beneath his foot, revealing a flight of granite steps that went down into the earth. Then, lighting a taper he had brought with him, Gerard descended the steps, and the flagstone swung into place behind him.\n\nOn the morrow, his betrothed, Eleanor des Lys, and all her bridal train, waited vainly for him at the cathedral of Vyones, the principal town of Averoigne, where the wedding had been set. And from that time his face was beheld by no man, and no vaguest rumor of Gerard de Venteillon or of the fate that befell him has ever passed among the living...\n\nSuch was the substance of the forbidden manuscript, and thus it ended. As I have said before, there was no date, nor was there anything to indicate by whom it had been written or how the knowledge of the happenings related had come into the writer's possession. But, oddly enough, it did not occur to me to doubt their veridity for a moment; and the curiosity I had felt concerning the contents of the manuscript was now replaced by a burning desire, a thousandfold more powerful, more obsessive, to know the ending of the story and to learn what Gerard de Venteillon had found when he descended the hidden steps.\n\nIn reading the tale, it had of course occurred to me that the ruins of the Chateau des Faussesflammes, described therein, were the very same ruins I had seen that morning from my chamber window; and pondering this, I became more and more possessed by an insane fever, by a frenetic, unholy excitement. Returning the manuscript to the secret drawer, I left the library and wandered for awhile in an aimless fashion about the corridors of the monastery. Chancing to meet there the same monk who had taken my horse in charge the previous evening, I ventured to question him, as discreetly and casually as I could, regarding the ruins which were visible from the abbey windows.\n\nHe crossed himself, and a frightened look came over his broad, placid face at my query.\n\n'The ruins are those of the Chateau des Faussesflammes,' he replied. 'For untold years, men say, they have been the haunt of unholy spirits, of witches and demons; and festivals not to be described or even named are held within their walls. No weapon known to man, no exorcism or holy water, has ever prevailed against these demons; many brave cavaliers and monks have disappeared amid the shadows of Faussesflammes, never to return; and once, it is told, an abbot of Perigon went thither to make war on the powers of evil; but what befell him at the hands of the succubi is not known or conjectured. Some say that the demons are abominable hags whose bodies terminate in serpentine coils; others that they are women of more than mortal beauty, whose kisses are a diabolic delight that consumes the flesh of men with the fierceness of hell-fire... As for me, I know not whether such tales are true; but I should not care to venture within the walls of Faussesflammes.'\n\nBefore he had finished speaking, a resolve had sprung to life full-born in my mind: I felt that I must go to the Chateau des Faussesflammes and learn for myself, if possible, all that could be learned. The impulse was immediate, overwhehning, ineluctable; and even if I had so desired, I could no more have fought against it than if I had been the victim of some sorcerer's invultuation. The proscription of the abbot Hilaire, the strange unfinished tale in the old manuscript, the evil legendry at which the monk had now hinted — all these, it would seem, should have served to frighten and deter me from such a resolve; but, on the contrary, by some bizarre inversion of thought, they seemed to conceal some delectable mystery, to denote a hidden world of ineffable things, of vague undreamable pleasures that set my brain on fire and made my pulses throb deliriously. I did not know, I could not conceive, of what these pleasures would consist; but in some mystical manner I was as sure of their ultimate reality as the abbot Hilaire was sure of heaven.\n\nI determined to go that very afternoon, in the absence of Hilaire, who, I felt instinctively, might be suspicious of any such intention on my part and would surely be inimical toward its fulfillment.\n\nMy preparations were very simple: I put in my pockets a small taper from my room and the heel of a loaf of bread from the refectory; and making sure that a little dagger which I always carried was in its sheath, I left the monastery forthwith. Meeting two of the brothers in the courtyard, I told them I was going for a short walk in the neighboring woods. They gave me a jovial 'pax vobiscum' and went upon their way in the spirit of the words.\n\nHeading directly as I could for Faussesflammes, whose turrets were often lost behind the high and interlacing boughs, I entered the forest. There were no paths, and often I was conpelled to brief detours and divagations by the thickness of the underbrush. In my feverous hurry to reach the ruins, it seemed hours before I came to the top of the hill which Faussesflammes surmounted, but probably it was little more than thirty minutes. Climbing the last declivity of the boulder-strewn slope, I came suddenly within view of the chateau, standing close at hand in the center of the level table which formed the summit. Trees had taken root in its broken-down walls, and the ruinous gateway that gave on the courtyard was half-choked by bushes, brambles and nettle-plants. Forcing my way through, not without difficulty, and with clothing that had suffered from the bramblethorns, I went, like Gerard de Venteillon in the old manuscript, to the northern end of the court. Enormous evil-looking weeds were rooted between the flagstones, rearing their thick and fleshy leaves that had turned to dull sinister maroons and purples with the onset of autumn. But I soon found the triangular flagstone indicated in the tale, and without the slightest delay or hesitation I pressed upon it with my right foot.\n\nA mad shiver, a thrill of adventurous triumph that was mingled with something of trepidation, leaped through me when the great flagstone tilted easily beneath my foot, disclosing dark steps of granite, even as in the story. Now, for a moment, the vaguely hinted horrors of the monkish legends became imminently real in my imagination, and I paused before the black opening that was to engulf me, eondering if some satanic spell had not drawn me thither to perils of unknown terror and inconceivable gravity.\n\nOnly for a few instants, however, did I hesitate. Then the sense of peril faded, the monkish horrors became a fantastic dream, and the charm of things unformulable, but ever closer at hand, always more readily attainable, tightened about me like the embrace of amorous arms. I lit my taper, I descended the stair; and even as behind Gerard de Venteillon, the triangular block of stone silently resumed its place in the paving of the court above me. Doubtless it was moved by some mechanism operable by a man's weight on one of the steps; but I did not pause to consider its modus operandi, or to wonder if there were any way by which it could be worked from beneath to permit my return.\n\nThere were perhaps a dozen steps, terminating in a low, narrow, musty vault that was void of anything more substantial than ancient, dust-encumbered cobwebs. At the end, a small doorway admitted me to a second vault that differed from the first only in being larger and dustier. I passed through several such vaults, and then found myself in a long passage or tunnel, half blocked in places by boulders or heaps of rubble that had fallen from the crumbling sides. It was very damp, and full of the noisome odor of stagnant waters and subterranean mold. My feet splashed more than once in little pools, and drops fell upon me from above, fetid and foul as if they had oozed from a charnel.\n\nBeyond the wavering circle of light that my taper maintained, it seemed to me that the coils of dim and shadowy serpents slithered away in the darkness at my approach; but I could not be sure whether they really were serpents, or only the troubled and retreating shadows, seen by an eye that was still unaccustomed to the gloom of the vaults.\n\nRounding a sudden turn in the passage, I saw the last thing I had dreamt of seeing — the gleam of sunlight at what was apparently the tunnel's end. I scarcely know what I had expected to find, but such an eventuation was somehow altogether unanticipated. I hurried on, in some confusion of thought, and stumbled through the opening, to find myself blinking in the full rays of the sun.\n\nEven before I had sufficiently recovered my wits and my eyesight to take note of the landscape before me, I was struck by a strange circumstance: Though it had been early afternoon when I entered the vaults, and though my passage through them could have been a matter of no more than a few minutes, the sun was now nearing the horizon. There was also a difference in its light, which was both brighter and mellower than the sun I had seen above Averoigne; and the sky itself was intensely blue, with no hint of autumnal pallor.\n\nNow, with ever-increasing stupefaction, I stared about me, and could find nothing familiar or even credible in the scene upon which I had emerged. Contrary to all reasonable expectation, there was no semblance of the hill upon which Faussesflammes stood, or of the adjoining country; but around me was a placid land of rolling meadows, through which a golden-gleaming river meandered toward a sea of deepest azure that was visible beyond the tops of laureltrees... But there are no laurel-trees in Averoigne, and the sea is hundreds of miles away: judge, then, my complete confusion and dumbfoundment.\n\nIt was a scene of such loveliness as I have never before beheld. The meadow-grass at my feet was softer and more lustrous than emerald velvet, and was full of violets and many-colored asphodels. The dark green of ilex-trees was mirrored in the golden river, and far away I saw the pale gleam of a marble acropolis on a low summit above the plain. All things bore the aspect of a mild and clement spring that was verging upon an opulent summer. I felt as if I had stepped into a land of classic myth, of Grecian legend; and moment by moment, all surprise, all wonder as to how I could have come there, was drowned in a sense of ever-growing ecstasy before the utter, ineffable beauty of the landscape.\n\nNear by, in a laurel-grove, a white roof shone in the late rays of the sun. I was drawn toward it by the same allurement, only far more potent and urgent, which I had felt on seeing the forbidden manuscript and the ruins of Faussesflammes. Here, I knew with an esoteric certainty, was the culmination of my quest, the reward of all my mad and perhaps impious curiosity.\n\nAs I entered the grove, I heard laughter among the trees, blending harmoniously with the low murmur of their leaves in a soft, balmy wind. I thought I saw vague forms that melted among the boles at my approach; and once a shaggy, goat-like creature with human head and body ran across my path, as if in pursuit of a flying nymph.\n\nIn the heart of the grove, I found a marble place with a portico of Doric columns. As I neared it, I was greeted by two women in the costume of ancient slaves; and though my Greek is of the meagerest, I found no difficulty in comprehending their speech, which was of Attic purity.\n\n'Our mistress, Nycea, awaits you,' they told me. I could no longer marvel at anything, but accepted my situation without question or surmise, like one who resigns himself to the progress of some delightful dream. Probably, I thought, it was a dream, and I was still lying in my bed at the monastery; but never before had I been favored by nocturnal visions of such clarity and surpassing loveliness. The interior of the palace was full of a luxury that verged upon the barbaric, and which evidently belonged to the period of Greek decadence, with its intermingling of Oriental influences. I was led through a hallway gIeaming with onyx and polished porphyry, into an opulently furnished room, where, on a couch of gorgeous fabrics, there reclined a woman of goddess-like beauty.\n\nAt sight of her, I trembled from head to foot with the violence of a strange emotion. I had heard of the sudden mad loves by which men are seized on beholding for the first time a certain face and form; but never before had I experienced a passion of such intensity, such all-consuming ardor, as the one I conceived immediately for this woman. Indeed, it seemed as if I had loved her for a long time, without knowing that it was she whom I loved, and without being able to identify the nature of my enotion or to orient the feeling in any manner.\n\nShe was not tall, but was formed with exquisite voluptuous purity of line and contour. Her eyes were of a dark sapphire blue, with molten depths into which the soul was fain to plunge as into the soft abysses of a summer ocean. The curve of her lips was enigmatic, a little mournful, and gravely tender as the lips of an antique Venus. Her hair, brownish rather than blond, fell over her neck and ears and forehead in delicious ripples confined by a plain fillet of silver. In her expression, there was a mixture of pride and voluptuousness, of regal imperiousness and feminine yielding. Her moverneats were all as efFortless and graceful as those of a serpent.\n\n'I knew you would come,' she murmured in the same softvoweled Greek I had heard from the lips of her servants. 'I have waited for you long; but when you sought refuge from the storm in the abbey of Perigon, and saw the manuscript in the secret drawer, I knew that the hour of your arrival was at hand. Ah! you did not dream that the spell which drew you so irresistibly, with such unaccountable potency, was the spell of my beauty, the magical allurement of my love!'\n\n'Who are you?' I queried. I spoke readily in Greek, which would have surprised me greatly an hour before. But now, I was prepared to accept anything whatever, no matter how fantastic or preposterous, as part of the miraculous fortune, the unbelievable adventure which had befallen me.\n\n'I am Nycea,' she replied to my question. 'I love you, and the hospitality of my palace and of my arms is at your disposal. Need you know anything nore?'\n\nThe slaves had disappeared. I flung myself beside the couch and kissed the hand she ofered me, pouring out protestations that were no doubt incoherent, but were nevertheless full of an ardor that made her smile tenderly. Her hand was cool to my lips, but the touch of it fired my passion. I ventured to seat myself beside her on the couch, and she did not deny my familiarity. While a soft purple twilight began to fill the corners of the chamber, we conversed happily, saying over and over again all the sweet absurd litanies, all the felicitous nothings that come instinctively to the lips of lovers. She was incredibly soft in my arms, and it seemed almost as if the completeness of her yielding was unhindered by the presence of bones in her lovely body.\n\nThe servants entered noiselessly, lighting rich lamps of intricately carven gold, and setting before us a meal of spicy meats, of unknown savorous fruits and potent wines. But I could eat little, and while I drank, I thirsted for the sweeter wine of Nycea's mouth.\n\nI do not know when we fell asleep; but the evening had flown like an enchanted moment. Heavy with felicity, I drifted off on a silken tide of drowsiness, and the golden lamps and the face of Nycea blurred in a blissful mist and were seen no more.\n\nSuddenly, from the depths of a slumber beyond all dreams, I found myself compelled into full wakefulness. For an instant, I did not even realize where I was, still less what had aroused me. Then I heard a footfall in the open doorway of the room, and peering across the sleeping head of Nycea, saw in the lamplight the abbot Hilaire, who had paused on the threshold, A look of absolute horror was imprinted upon his face, and as he caught sight of me, he began to gibber in Latin, in tones where something of fear was blended with fanatical abhorrence and hatred. I saw that he carried in his hands a large bottle and an aspergillus. I felt sure that the bottle was full of holy water, and of course divined the use for which it was intended.\n\nLooking at Nycea, I saw that she too was awake, and knew that she was aware of the abbot's presence. She gave me a strange smile, in which I read an affectionate pity, mingled with the reassurance that a woman offers a frightened child.\n\n'Do not fear for me,' she whispered.\n\n'Foul vampire! accursed lamia! she-serpent of hell!' thundered the abbot suddenly, as he crossed the threshold of the room, raising the aspergillus aloft. At the same moment, Nycea glided from the couch, with an unbelievable swiftness of motion, and vanished through an outer door that gave upon the forest of laurels. Her voice hovered in my ear, seeming to come from an immense distance:\n\n'Farewell for awhile, Christophe. But have no fear. You shall find me again if you are brave and patient.'\n\nAs the words ended, the holy water from the aspergillus fell on the floor of the chamber and on the couch where Nycea had lain beside me. There was a crash as of many thunders, and the golden lamps went out in a darkness that seemed full of falling dust, of raining fragments. I lost all consciousness, and when I recovered, I found myself lying on a heap of rubble in one of the vaults I had traversed earlier in the day. With a taper in his hand, and an expression of great solicitude, of infinite pity upon his face, Hilaire was stooping over me. Beside him lay the bottle and the dripping aspergillus.\n\n'I thank God, my son, that I found you in good time,' he said. 'When I returned to the abbey this evening and learned that you were gone, I surmised all that had happened. I knew you had read the accursed manuscript in my absence, and had fallen under its baleful spell, as have so many others, even to a certain reverend abbot, one of my predecessors. All of them, alas! beginning hundreds of years ago with Gerard de Venteillon, have fallen victims to the lamia who dwells in these vaults.'\n\n'The lamia?' I questioned, hardly comprehending his words.\n\n'Yes, my son, the beautiful Nycea who lay in your arms this night is a lamia, an ancient vampire, who maintains in these noisome vaults her palace of beatific illusions. How she came to take up her abode at Faussesflammes is not known, for her coming antedates the memory of men. She is old as paganism; the Greeks knew her; she was exorcised by Apollonius of Tyana; and if you could behold her as she really is, you would see, in lieu of her voluptuous body, the folds of a foul and monstrous serpent. All those whom she loves and admits to her hospitality, she devours in the end, after she has drained them of life and vigor with the diabolic delight of her kisses. The laurel-wooded plain you saw, the ilex-bordered river, the marble palace and all the luxury therein, were no more than a satanic delusion, a lovely bubble that rose from the dust and mold of immemorial death, of ancient corruption. They crumbled at the kiss of the holy water I brought with me when I followed you. But Nycea, alas! has escaped, and I fear she will still survive, to build again her palace of demoniacal enchantments, to commit again and again the unspeakable abomination of her sins.'\n\nStill in a sort of stupor at the ruin of my new-found happiness, at the singular revelations made by the abbot, I followed him obediently as he led the way through the vaults of Faussesflammes. He mounted the stairway by which I had descended, and as he neared the top and was forced to stoop a little, the great flagstone swung upward, letting in a stream of chill moonlight. We emerged; and I permitted him to take me back to the monastery.\n\nAs my brain began to clear, and the confusion into which I had been thrown resolved itself, a feeling of resentment grew apace — a keen anger at the interference of Hilaire. Unheedful whether or not he had rescued me from dire physical and spiritual perils, I lamented the beautiful dream of which he had deprived me. The kisses of Nycea burned softly in my memory, and I knew that whatever she was, woman or demon or serpent, there was no one in all the world who could ever arouse in me the same love and the same delight. I took care, however, to conceal my feellings fron Hilaire, realizing that a betrayal of such emotions would merely lead him to look upon me as a soul that was lost beyond redemption.\n\nOn the morrow, pleading the urgency of my return home, I departed from Perigon. Now, in the library of my father's house near Moulins, I write this account of my adventures. The memory of Nycea is magically clear, ineffably dear as if she were still beside me, and still I see the rich draperies of a midnight chamber illumined by lamps of curiously carven gold, and still I hear the words of her farewell:\n\n'Have no fear. You shall find me again if you are brave and patient.'\n\nSoon I shall return, to visit again the ruins of the Chateau des Faussesflammes, and redescend into the vaults below the triangular flagstone. But, in spite of the nearness of Perigon to Faussesflammes, in spite of my esteem for the abbot, my gratitude for his hospitality and my admiration for his incomparable library, I shall not care to revisit my friend Hilaire.",

"以下叙述发现于图尔市年轻法学生克里斯托弗·莫兰德的文稿中。1798年11月，他在穆兰附近父亲家中离奇失踪：\n\n一片不祥的褐紫色暮色因即将来临的雷暴而提前笼罩了阿弗罗尼森林。道旁的树木已化作模糊的暗影，而眼前在愈发浓重的幽暗中显得苍白如幽灵的道路，仿佛随着某种神秘地震的颤动而微微摇晃。我催策着那匹黎明启程后早已疲惫不堪的马匹——它数小时前就已不情不愿地慢跑起来——我们沿着昏暗的道路疾驰，途经那些仿佛伸出枝干如攫取之手的巨大橡树。\n\n黑夜以骇人的速度降临，黑暗化作黏稠可触的帷幕；梦魇般的混乱与绝望驱使我更残忍地鞭策坐骑。此刻，远处第一声闷雷与马蹄声交织，最初的闪电照亮了道路——令我惊愕的是（我原以为正行驶在穿越阿弗罗尼的主干道上），它竟莫名缩窄成一条人迹斑驳的小径。确信自己已然迷路，却不愿在黑暗与翻腾的暴风云前折返，我继续前行，理性地期盼这条明显常有人迹的小径终将通向某座可供夜宿的宅邸。这希望很快应验：几分钟后，我透过枝桠望见微光，突然来到一片林间空地。缓坡上矗立着一座巨宅，下层亮着几扇灯火通明的窗户，而顶部几乎与奔涌的云团融为一体。\n\n\"想必是座修道院，\"我勒马思忖，翻身下马后抓住那个犬首形状的沉重铜门环叩向橡木门扉。声响出奇地洪亮庄严，带着近乎墓穴般的回音，我不由自主地战栗，感到一种异常的惊惶。这情绪在门扉洞开时瞬间消散——一位面色红润的高大修士站在火炬照亮的宽敞门厅里。\n\n\"欢迎来到佩里冈修道院，\"他醇厚的声音隆隆作响。话音未落，另一位罩着兜帽的僧侣已牵走我的马匹。正当我低声道谢时，暴雨骤至，裹挟着逼近的雷鸣，恶魔般鞭笞着身后刚合拢的门板。\n\n\"您来得正是时候，\"主人说道，\"此等炼狱般的天气实在不宜出行。\"他洞悉我的饥乏，引我至餐厅，摆上羊肉、黑面包、扁豆和醇厚的红葡萄酒盛宴。\n\n用餐时，我得以细察这位对坐的修士。魁梧身躯上宽阔的前额与有力的下颌同样醒目，昭示着智慧与享乐的天性。他身上散发着某种优雅的学者气质，令我不禁暗想：\"这位修士定是典籍与美酒的鉴赏家。\"仿佛回应我的心思，他开口道：\n\n\"我是佩里冈修道院院长希莱尔。我们本笃会修士与神人皆和睦共处，不认为肉体苦修能滋养灵魂。地窖里储藏着阿弗罗尼地区最陈年的佳酿。若您感兴趣，我们的图书馆还收藏着异教与基督世界的珍本，甚至包括某些从亚历山大城大火中幸存的孤本。\"\n\n\"感激您的盛情，\"我鞠躬道，\"我是克里斯托弗·莫兰德，法学学生，正从图尔返回穆兰附近的家族庄园。同为爱书之人，能鉴赏如此丰富的藏书实乃幸事。\"\n\n用餐期间，我们纵论古典著作，竞相援引拉丁、希腊与基督教作家的篇章。很快我发现院长是位学识惊人的学者，其博闻强识令我的知识相形见绌。他善意称赞我尚欠纯熟的拉丁文，待饮尽红酒时，我们已如老友般畅谈。\n\n疲惫尽消后，院长提议参观图书馆，我欣然应允。穿过两侧皆是修士居所的长廊，他用腰间黄铜大钥匙打开高顶藏书室的门扉。此处珍藏确非虚言：长架挤满典籍，桌上堆叠着卷轴——有拜占庭与科普特圣经，镶花嵌宝的阿拉伯波斯抄本，早期印刷术的摇篮本，以及装帧着象牙木板的修士手抄本。\n\n希莱尔院长如数家珍地展示藏品，最后触动机关，拉出暗格：\"这里有些不便示众的珍宝，\"他指着卡图卢斯失传的三首颂歌，萨福完整诗篇的手稿，米利都失传故事，伯里克利致阿斯帕西娅的信函，柏拉图佚失的对话录，以及预见哥白尼学说的匿名阿拉伯天文学著作。最后是臭名昭著、出版即遭销毁的《爱情史》，\"世间仅存两册\"。\n\n当我敬畏地凝视这些瑰宝时，暗格角落一本无题黑皮薄册吸引了注意。我拾起发现是数页古法语写就的密文手稿。\n\n\"这个呢？\"我转向院长，惊见他突然面色阴郁。\"孩子，莫问为好。\"他画着十字，声音不再圆润，\"您手中的书页附着诅咒。翻阅者将陷于灵肉俱危之境。\"他夺回小册放回暗格，又画了个十字。\n\n\"但神父，\"我争辩道，\"几张羊皮纸能有何危险？\"\"克里斯托弗，有些事物超出您的理解。撒旦的威能显现于万千形式，有些诱惑比俗世欲望更诡谲，有些邪恶既隐秘又无可抗拒。\"当我追问内容时，他厉声禁止：\"对您这样充满好奇的年轻人尤为危险。忘了它吧。\"\n\n他转而展示彼特拉克珍藏的奥维德诗集，恢复了慈祥学者形象。但那禁忌手稿的阴影已烙在我心头。整晚我心神不宁，各种荒诞可怖的猜测在脑海翻腾。\n\n子夜时分，他领我前往专为访客准备的奢华客房。尽管暴雨已歇，我仍辗转反侧，直至坠入无梦的深眠。\n\n晨光如熔金泻入窗棂时，我望见雨钻缀饰的秋野美景。但目光很快被一英里外山丘上的古堡废墟攫住。那些倾颓的塔楼墙垣散发着难以言喻的魔力，令我长久凝望，沉入无法追忆却令人战栗的遐想。\n\n敲门声惊醒了我——是前来问候的院长。不知为何，我为被撞见白日梦而赧然。早餐后我本欲辞行，但院长真挚的挽留让我决定再宿一夜。事实上，那部禁书的谜团已俘获我的想象，何况对学者而言，这座图书馆实乃珍宝。\n\n\"我想借阅您无与伦比的收藏进行研究。\"\"孩子，您愿留多久都行。\"希莱尔解下藏书室钥匙递给我，\"今日我需离院数小时，您可随时研读。\"\n\n稍后，他借故告退。我暗自庆幸这梦寐以求的机会竟如此轻易落入掌中，便匆匆赶往图书馆，心中唯有一个念头——阅读那部禁书。我几乎没瞥一眼那些摆满典籍的书架，径直走向藏有暗格的桌子，摸索着机关。在焦灼的短暂等待后，我按下正确位置，抽屉应声而开。一种已然化作执念的冲动，近乎癫狂的好奇热病驱使我——即便灵魂的救赎真系于此——我也无法抗拒那股迫使我取出那本素面无字薄册的欲望。\n\n我在靠窗的椅子上坐下，开始翻阅仅有六页的手稿。字迹诡谲离奇，字母形态之怪诞前所未见，所用法语不仅古老，更因奇特的独特性而近乎野蛮。尽管破译艰难，开篇第一句便令我浑身战栗，带着中蛊者或饮下迷药之人特有的恍惚，我继续读了下去。\n\n文稿无题无日期，叙事起讫皆突兀。它讲述文特拉永伯爵杰拉德的故事：这位骑士在迎娶名媛埃莉诺·德·利前夕，于城堡附近的森林遇见半人半兽的怪物。正如文稿所述，杰拉德是位骁勇虔诚的基督徒，遂以救主耶稣基督之名喝令怪物止步自陈。\n\n暮色中，那畸形生物狂笑着在他面前蹦跳，喊道：\"我是萨梯，你们基督于我不过厨房垃圾堆上的杂草！\"杰拉德正欲拔剑诛杀这亵渎者，怪物又叫道：\"且慢！文特拉永的杰拉德，我要告诉你个秘密。知晓之后，你将忘却基督崇拜，遗忘明日的新娘，头也不回地背弃人世与阳光。\"杰拉德虽不情愿，仍侧耳倾听。萨梯凑近低语的内容无人知晓，但在消失于渐暗林影前，它最后高声说道：\"基督之力如黑霜摧残了众神欢居的森林原野，但在地下幽穴——如你们教士杜撰的地狱般深邃之处，仍存异教之美，仍响异教狂喜。\"伴着非人的笑声，它隐入暮色树影。\n\n自那一刻，杰拉德判若两人。他垂首归堡，一反常态地对仆从不发一言，只是沉默踱步，对食物也漠不关心。当晚他失约未访未婚妻，却在血月升起时潜出城堡，循着荒径来到与本笃会修道院相对的假焰堡废墟。\n\n（手稿称）这废墟因自古相传的邪恶传说而被当地人回避，据称是恶灵与巫觋聚集之所。但杰拉德如受魔驱般踏入倾颓墙影，摸索至庭院北端，在两扇正中窗棂下的三角地砖上踏足。地砖翻转，露出通向地底的花岗岩阶梯。他点燃随身蜡烛拾级而下，身后地砖无声复位。\n\n次日，新娘埃莉诺与仪仗在维永大教堂空等。从此再无人见过杰拉德，他的命运成为永世之谜......\n\n禁书内容至此戛然而止。尽管无日期无作者，我却对其真实性深信不疑。原先对手稿内容的好奇，此刻已化作千万倍强烈的渴望——我要知道杰拉德在阶梯之下发现了什么。\n\n阅读时我已意识到，文中描述的假焰堡废墟正是今晨从我窗口所见。思及此，一种癫狂的燥热逐渐占据全身。将手稿放回暗格后，我在修道院走廊漫无目的地游荡，恰遇昨夜照料马匹的修士，便佯作随意地问起窗外废墟之事。\n\n他在胸前画十字，宽厚面容浮现惧色：\"那是假焰堡废墟。相传几个世纪以来，那里盘踞着渎神恶灵，举行不可名状的邪秽仪式。凡间武器与圣水对其无效，许多勇士修士入内便杳无音讯。据说曾有佩里冈院长前往征讨，却遭魅魔毒手......有人说那些恶魔是蛇身老妪，也有人说是艳绝人寰的妖女，其吻如地狱烈火蚀骨......\"\n\n他话音未落，一个决心已在我心中完整浮现：我必须亲赴假焰堡一探究竟。这冲动如此强烈，恍若中了巫术般无法抗拒。希莱尔院长的禁令、残缺的手稿、修士暗示的恐怖传说——非但未能阻我，反似在昭示某个隐秘而甜美的谜团，某种令血脉贲张的无名欢愉。\n\n我决定趁希莱尔外出时即刻动身。准备极其简单：揣上房中蜡烛与食堂面包，确认随身匕首无恙后便离开修道院。在庭院遇见两位修士时，我只说要去附近树林散步。他们愉快地祝我\"平安\"后离去。\n\n我径直朝时隐时现于密林间的城堡尖顶走去。无路可循的森林里，灌木常迫我绕行。焦灼中仿佛耗费数小时，实则不过三十分钟，我便登上了假焰堡所在的山顶。攀过乱石坡的最后陡面，城堡废墟赫然矗立在平顶山中央。断墙生根着树木，庭院入口被荆棘荨麻半掩。我艰难穿行，衣物被扯破，如手稿中的杰拉德般来到北院。秋意已使石板间蔓生的肥厚野草转为暗紫。我很快找到三角地砖，毫不犹豫地踏了上去。\n\n当地砖在脚下倾斜，露出花岗岩阶梯时，一阵混杂战栗的狂喜席卷全身。此刻修士传说中的恐怖在想象中变得真切，我在黑洞洞的入口前迟疑，怀疑是否某种邪术诱我踏入未知险境。但这犹豫仅持续片刻。危险感消退后，修士的警告化作幻梦，而某种难以言喻却近在咫尺的诱惑，如情人之臂将我环抱。我点燃蜡烛拾级而下，头顶地砖悄然复位。\n\n约十二级台阶后，我来到低矮霉味的地窖，穿过数个类似空间后进入一条隧道。塌方的碎石不时阻塞通道，腐水与地霉的恶臭弥漫。水洼溅湿我的脚，上方滴落的液体散发着尸窖般的恶臭。摇曳烛光外，似有朦胧蛇影在黑暗中游移，但难辨真假。\n\n隧道拐弯处，我竟看见了最意想不到的景象——阳光在尽头闪烁。困惑中我踉跄冲出洞口，眨眼站在灿烂阳光下。\n\n最先震撼我的是时间异常：进入地窖分明是午后，穿越耗时不过数分钟，此刻太阳却已西沉。而且这阳光比奥弗涅的更明亮柔和，天空蓝得深邃，毫无秋日苍白。\n\n当我环顾四周，愈发震惊地发现所处之地全然陌生。假焰堡所在的山丘与毗邻乡野皆无踪影，眼前只有绵延起伏的宁静草场，金色河流蜿蜒流向月桂树梢后方的蔚蓝海洋......可奥弗涅既无月桂树，海洋更在百里之外——请想象我当时的错愕。\n\n这美景超乎平生所见。脚下草茵比翡翠天鹅绒更柔亮，紫罗兰与各色水仙点缀其间。冬青树的墨绿倒映金河，远处平原低丘上大理石卫城泛着微光。万物都呈现春夏之交的温润丰饶，恍若踏入希腊神话之境。最初的惊诧很快被愈演愈烈的狂喜淹没。\n\n附近月桂林中，白屋顶在夕阳下闪耀。那种曾驱使我去读禁书、访废墟的诱惑——此刻强烈千万倍——牵引着我向前。我玄妙地确信：此处便是追寻的终点，所有疯狂或许渎神的好奇心终将得报。\n\n步入树林时，我听见笑声与叶鸣在香风中交织。朦胧人影似乎在我靠近时隐入树干，还有个羊腿人身的毛茸生物追逐着飞逃的宁芙掠过小径。\n\n在小树林的深处，我找到了一座多立克柱式门廊的大理石建筑。当我走近时，两名身着古代奴隶服饰的女子向我致意；尽管我的希腊语极为贫乏，却毫不费力地听懂了她们纯正的阿提卡方言。\n\n\"我们的女主人妮西亚正等候着您。\"她们说道。此刻我已对任何奇事都失去了惊诧的能力，如同沉浸在美妙梦境中的人一般，毫无疑虑地接受了眼前的一切。或许，我想，这不过是一场梦，我仍躺在修道院的床榻上；但从未有哪次夜梦能赐予我如此清晰绝伦的景象。宫殿内部充斥着近乎野蛮的奢华，明显带着希腊衰败时期混杂东方风情的特征。我被引领着穿过铺满缟玛瑙与磨光斑岩的走廊，进入一间陈设华丽的房间，那里有位女神般的美人斜倚在锦绣软榻上。\n\n一见到她，某种强烈而陌生的情愫使我浑身战栗。我曾听闻人们初见某些容颜时会突发癫狂爱恋，但从未体验过如此炽烈、如此吞噬一切的激情——我对这位女子瞬间萌生的爱意。仿佛我早已爱慕她多年，却不知所爱为何物，亦无法名状这份情感的实质。\n\n她身量不高，但曲线玲珑得令人心醉。那双深蓝如蓝宝石的眼眸，其深处似有熔岩流动，让人甘愿如投身夏日海洋的温柔深渊般沉溺其中。她的唇线神秘莫测，略带哀愁，庄重而温柔如古代维纳斯雕像。棕褐色秀发如波浪般垂落颈项，仅以素银发带束起。她的神情交织着傲慢与纵欲，既有女王般的威严，又具女性的柔顺。每个动作都如蛇行般优雅自如。\n\n\"我知道你会来。\"她用与侍女们同样柔和的希腊语低语，\"我等待已久；当你在佩里贡修道院避雨，发现暗格中的手稿时，我便知你降临的时刻将至。啊！你岂会想到，那不可抗拒吸引你的魔力，正是我美貌的咒语，我爱情的魔法诱惑！\"\n\n\"你是谁？\"我问道。此刻我竟能流畅使用希腊语，若在一小时前定会令我惊诧不已。但现在，我已准备好接受任何荒诞离奇之事，视其为降临在我身上的神异际遇。\n\n\"我是妮西亚，\"她答道，\"我爱你，我的宫殿与怀抱皆任你享用。还需知道更多么？\"\n\n奴隶们悄然退去。我扑倒在软榻旁亲吻她伸来的手，语无伦次地倾诉着炽热情话，引得她温柔浅笑。她手指的凉意反令我欲火焚身。我斗胆坐至她身旁，她亦未拒绝我的亲近。当紫色暮色渐染房间角落时，我们幸福地交谈着，重复着恋人间那些甜蜜愚蠢的絮语。她在我怀中柔软得不可思议，仿佛那具美妙躯体里根本不存在骨骼的阻碍。\n\n仆人们无声地进来，点亮精雕金灯，摆上香料烹制的肉食、不知名的甘美果实与烈酒。但我几乎无法进食，啜饮美酒时只渴望妮西亚唇间更甜美的琼浆。\n\n不知何时我们沉入梦乡；这个夜晚如魔法时刻般飞逝。在幸福的倦意中，我随丝绸般的困意漂流，金灯与妮西亚的容颜渐渐模糊于极乐的雾霭中。\n\n突然，我从超越所有梦境的沉睡中被强行惊醒。片刻间我甚至不知身在何处，更不晓是何物惊醒了我。接着我听见房门处的脚步声，越过妮西亚的睡颜，我看见希莱尔院长手持大瓶与圣水刷站在灯影里。他脸上凝固着极度惊恐，当发现我时，他开始用拉丁语尖声咒骂，声调里混杂着恐惧与狂热的憎恶。我确信瓶中盛着圣水，也明白其用途。\n\n转头看向妮西亚，发现她也已醒来。她给我一个诡异的微笑，其中包含着爱怜的同情，如同安抚受惊孩童的女性的神情。\n\n\"别为我担心。\"她低语。\n\n\"肮脏的吸血鬼！受诅咒的拉弥亚！地狱的蛇女！\"院长怒吼着跨过门槛高举圣水刷。与此同时，妮西亚以难以置信的速度滑下软榻，穿过通往月桂树林的外门消失无踪。她的声音如从遥远之处飘入我耳中：\n\n\"暂别了，克里斯托弗。但无需恐惧。只要你勇敢耐心，必会再寻到我。\"\n\n话音未落，圣水洒落在房间地面与我们共枕的软榻上。随着雷霆般的巨响，金灯在漫天尘埃中熄灭。我彻底失去意识，醒来时发现自己躺在白天曾穿过的某个地窖瓦砾堆上。希莱尔手持蜡烛，满面忧色地俯视着我，身旁躺着空瓶与滴水的圣水刷。\n\n\"感谢上帝及时让我找到你，\"他说，\"今晚我回到修道院发现你失踪时，便猜到了一切。你趁我不在读了那受诅咒的手稿，像包括某位前任院长在内的许多人一样，中了它的邪毒。可叹啊！从数百年前的杰拉德·德·旺特隆开始，他们都成了地窖里那只拉弥亚的牺牲品。\"\n\n\"拉弥亚？\"我困惑道。\n\n\"是的，今夜在你怀中的美丽妮西亚，正是栖息在这恶臭地窖里编织极乐幻象的古老吸血鬼。无人知晓她何时盘踞在福瑟弗拉姆，因她的存在早于人类记忆。她与异教信仰同样古老；希腊人知晓她；提亚纳的阿波罗尼乌斯曾驱赶过她；若你见到其真身，将目睹一条污秽巨蛇盘踞在那妖娆躯体之下。所有被她诱入温柔乡的人，终将在她恶魔之吻吸干精血后沦为腹中餐。你所见的月桂林、圣栎环绕的河流、大理石宫殿及其中奢华，不过是源自古老腐朽尘埃的邪恶魔幻，一个美丽的泡沫。它们在我带来的圣水触碰下土崩瓦解。但妮西亚逃走了，恐怕她还会重建恶魔宫殿，继续犯下不可言说的罪孽。\"\n\n仍沉浸在新得幸福破灭的恍惚中，我机械地跟随希莱尔穿越福瑟弗拉姆的地窖。当他俯身推开那块三角石板时，清冷月光倾泻而下。回到修道院后，随着神智逐渐清明，我对希莱尔干涉的愤恨与日俱增。无论他是否将我从肉体和灵魂的双重危机中解救出来，我只痛惜被他摧毁的美梦。妮西亚的吻仍在我记忆中灼烧，我深知无论她是女人、恶魔还是蛇妖，世间再无人能唤起我同样的爱恋与欢愉。但我小心隐藏这些情绪，深知希莱尔会视我为无可救药的灵魂。\n\n次日，我以急事为由离开佩里贡。此刻在穆兰附近父亲宅邸的书房里，我记录下这段遭遇。妮西亚的记忆如魔法般清晰珍贵，仿佛仍在我身旁。我仍能看见精雕金灯照耀下的午夜闺阁帷幔，仍能听见她临别的话语：\n\n\"无需恐惧。只要你勇敢耐心，必会再寻到我。\"\n\n不久我将重返福瑟弗拉姆城堡废墟，再次踏入三角石板下的地窖。尽管佩里贡近在咫尺，尽管我敬重院长，感激他的款待并钦佩其无与伦比的藏书——我却无意再访我的朋友希莱尔。"

        "content": "\n\nRaoul, Comte de la Frenaie, was by nature the most unsuspicious of husbands. His lack of suspicion, perhaps, was partly lack of imagination; and, for the rest, was doubtless due to the dulling of his observational faculties by the heavy wines of Averoigne. At any rate, he had never seen anything amiss in the friendship of his wife, Adele, with Olivier du Montoir, a young poet who might in time have rivalled Ronsard as one of the most brilliant luminaries of the Pleiade, if it had not been for an unforeseen but fatal circumstance. Indeed, M. le Comte had been rather proud than otherwise, because of the interest shown in Mme. la Comtesse by this erudite and comely youth, who had already moistened his lips at the fount of Helicon and was becoming known throughout other provinces than Averoigne for his melodious villanelles and graceful ballades. Nor was Raoul disturbed by the fact that many of these same villanelles and ballades were patently written in celebration of Adele's visible charms, and made liberal mention of her wine-dark tresses, her golden eyes, and sundry other details no less alluring, and equally essential to feminine perfection. M. le Comte did not pretend to understand poetry: like many others, he considered it something apart frorn all common sense or mundane relevancy; and his mental powers became totally paralysed whenever they were confronted by anything in rhyme and metre. In the meanwhile, the ballades and their author were gradually waxing in boldness.\n\nThat year, the snows of an austere winter had melted away in a week of halcyon warmth; and the land was filled with the tender green and chrysolite and chrysoprase of early spring. Olivier came oftener and oftener to the chateau de la Frenaie, and he and Adele were often alone, since they had so much to talk that was beyond the interests or the comprehension of M. le Comte. And now, sometimes, they walked abroad in the forest about the chateau the forest that rolled a sea of vernal verdure almost to the grey walls and barbican, and within whose sun-warm glades the perfume of the first wild flowers was tingeing delicately the quiet air. If people gossiped, they did so discreetly and beyond hearing of Raoul, or of Adele and Olivier.\n\nAll things being as they were, it is hard to know just why M. le Comte became suddenly troubled concerning the integrity of his marital honour. Perhaps, in some interim of the hunting and drinking between which he divided nearly all his time, he had noticed that his wife was growing younger and fairer and was blooming as a woman never blooms except to the magical sunlight of love. Perhaps he had caught some glance of ardent or affectionate understanding between Adele and Olivier; or, perhaps, it was the infuence of the premature spring, which had pierced the vinous muddlernent of his brain with an obscure stirring of forgotten thoughts and emotions, and thus had given him a flash of insight. At any rate, he was troubled when, on this afternoon of earliest April, he returned to the chateau from Vyones, where he had gone on business, and learned from his servitors that Mme. la Comtesse and Olivier du Montoir had left a few minutes previously for a promenade in the forest. His dull face, however, betrayed little. He seemed to reflect for a moment. Then:\n\n'Which way did they go? I have reason to see Mme. la Cormtesse at once.'\n\nHis servants gave him the required direction, and he went out, following slowly the footpath they had indicated, till he was beyond sight of the chateau. Then he quickened his pace, and began to finger the hilt of his rapier as he went on through the thickening woods.\n\n'I am a little afraid, Olivier. Shall we go any farther?'\n\nAdele and Olivier had wandered beyond the limits of their customary stroll, and were nearing a portion of the forest of Averoigne where the trees were older and taller than all others. Here, some of the huge oaks were said to date back to pagan days. Few people ever passed beneath them; and queer beliefs and legends concerning them had been prevalent among the local peasantry for ages. Things had been seen within these precincts, whose very existence was an affront to science and a blasphemy to religion; and evil influences were said to attend those who dared to intrude upon the sullen umbrage of the immemorial glades and thickets. The beliefs varied, and the legends were far from explicit; but all agreed that the wood was haunted by some entity inimical to man, some primordial spirit of ill that was ancienter than Christ or Satan. Panic, madness, demoniac possession, or baleful, unreasoning passions that led them to doom, were the lot of all who had trodden the demesnes of this entity. There were those who whispered what the spirit was, who told incredible tales regarding its true nature, and described its true aspect; but such tales were not meet for the ear of devout Christians.\n\n'Prithee, let us go on,' said Olivier. 'Look you, Madame, and see how the ancient trees have put on the emerald freshness of April, how innocently they rejoice in the sun's return.'\n\n'But the stories people tell, Olivier.'\n\n'They are stories to frighten children. Let us go on. There is nothing to harm us here, but much of beauty to enchant.'\n\nIndeed, as he had said, the great-limbed oaks and venerable beeches were fresh with their new-born foliage. The forest wore an aspect of blitheness and vertumnal gaiety, and it was hard to believe the old superstitions and legends. The day was one of those days when hearts that feel the urgency of an unavowed love are fain to wander indefinitely. So, after certain feminine demurs, and many reassurances, Adele allowed Olivier to persuade her, and they ment on.\n\nThe feet of anirnals, if not of men, had continued the path they were following, and had made an easy way into the wood of fabulous evil. The drooping boughs enfolded them with arms of soft verdure, and seemed to draw them in; and shafts of yellow sunshine rifted the high trees, to aureole the lovely secret lilies that bloomed about the darkly writhing coils of enormous roots. The trees were twisted and knotted, were heavy with centurial incrustations of bark, were humped and misshapen with the growth of unremembered years; but there was an air of antique wisdom about them, together with a tranquil friendliness. Adele exclaimed with delight; and neither she nor Olivier was aware of anything sinister or doubtful in the unison of exquisite beauty and gnarled quaintness which the old forest offered to them.\n\n'Was I not right?' Olivier queried. 'Is there ought to fear in harmless trees and flowers?'\n\nAdele smiled, but made no other answer. In the circle of bright sunlight where they were now standing, she and Olivier looked at each other with a new and pervasive intimacy. There was a strange perfume on the windless air, coming in slow wafts from an undiscernible source - a perfume that seemed to speak insidiously of love and langour and amorous yielding. Neither knew the flower from which it issued, for all at once there were many unfamiliar blossoms around their feet, with heavy bells of carnal white or pink, or curled and twining petals, or hearts like a rosy wound. Looking, they saw each other as in a sudden dazzle of flame; and each felt a violent quickening of the blood, as if they had drunk a sovereign philtre. The same thought was manifest in the bold fervour of Olivier's eyes, and the modest flush upon the cheeks of Mme. la Comtesse. The long-cherished love, which neither had openly declared up to this hour, was clamouring importunately in the veins of both. They resumed their onward walk; and both were now silent through the self-same feeling of embarrassment and constraint.\n\nThey dared not look at each other; and neither of them had eyes for the changing character of the wood through which they wandered; and neither saw the foul, obscene deformity of the grey boles that gathered on each hand, or the shameful and monstrous fungi that reared their spotted pallor in the shade, or the red, venerous flowers that flaunted themselves in the sun. The spell of their desire was upon the lovers; they were drugged with the mandragora of passion; and everything beyond their own bodies, their own hearts, the throbbing of their own delirious blood, was vaguer than a dream.\n\nThe wood grew thicker and the arching boughs above were a weft of manifold gloom. The eyes of ferine animals peered from their hidden burrows, with gleams of crafty crimson or chill, ferocious beryl; and the dank smell of stagnant waters, choked with the leaves of bygone autumn, arose to greet Adele and Olivier, and to break a' little the perilous charm that possessed them.\n\nThey paused on the edge of a rock-encircled pool, above which the ancient alders twined their decaying tops, as if to maintain forever the mad posture of a superannuate frenzy. And there, between the nether boughs of the alders in a frame of new leaves, they saw the face that leered upon them.\n\nThe apparition was incredible; and, for the space of a long breath, they could not believe they had really seen it. There were two horns in a matted mass of coarse, animal-like hair above the semi-human face with its obliquely slitted eyes and fang-revealing mouth and beard of wild-boar bristles. The face was old - incomputably old; and its lines and wrinkles were those of unreckoned years of lust; and its look was filled with the slow, unceasing increment of all the malignity and corruption and cruelty of elder ages. It was the face of Pan, as he glared from his, secret wood upon travellers taken unaware.\n\nAdele and Olivier were seized by a nightmare terror, as they: recalled the old legends. The charm of their passionate obsession was broken, and the drug of desire relinquished its hold on their senses. Like people awakened from a heavy sleep, they saw the face, and heard through the tumult of their blood the cachinnation of a wild and evil and panic laughter, as the apparition vanished among the boughs.\n\nShuddering, Adele flung herself for the first time into the arms of her lover.\n\n'Did you see it?' she whispered, as she clung to him.\n\nOlivier drew her close. In that delicious nearness, the horrible thing he had seen and heard became somehow improbable and unreal. There must have been a double sorcery abroad, to lull his horror thus; but he knew not whether the thing had been a momentary hallucination, a fantasy wrought by the sun amid the alder-leaves, or the demon that was fabled to dwell in Averoigne; and the startlement he had felt was somehow without meaning or reason. He could even thank the apparition, whatever it was, because it had thrown Adele into his embrace. He could think of nothing now but the proximity of that warm, delectable mouth, for which he had hungered so long. He began to reassure her, to make light of her fears, to pretend that she could have seen nothing; and his reassurances merged into ardent protestations of love. He kissed her... and they both forgot the vision of the satyr....\n\nThey were lying on a gatch of golden moss, where the sunrays fell through a single cleft in the high foliage, when Raoul found them. They did not see or hear him, as he paused and stood with drawn rapier before the vision of their unlawful happiness.\n\nHe was about to fling himself upon them and impale the two with a single thrust where they lay, when an unlooked-for and scarce conceivable thing occurred. With swiftness veritably supernatural, a brown hairy creature, a being that was not wholly man, not wholly animal, but some hellish mixture of both, sprang from amid the alder branches and snatched Adele from Olivier's embrace. Olivier and Raoul saw it only in one fleeting glimpse, and neither could have described it clearly afterwards. But the face was that which had leered upon the lovers from the foliage; and the shaggy' legs and body were those of a creature of antique legend. It disappeared as incredibly as it had come, bearing the woman in its arms; and her shrieks of terror were surmounted by the pealing of its mad, diabolical laughter.\n\nThe shrieks and laughter died away at some distant remove in the green silence of the forest, and were not followed by any other sound. Raoul and Olivier could only stare at each other in complete stupefaction.",
        "content_cn": "拉乌尔·德·拉弗雷奈伯爵天生就是个最不疑心的丈夫。他之所以不疑心，或许部分是由于缺乏想象力；而其余的原因，无疑要归咎于阿维罗涅的烈酒麻痹了他的观察力。无论如何，他从未觉得妻子阿黛尔与年轻诗人奥利维尔·杜蒙托瓦之间的友谊有何不妥——这位诗人若非遭遇不测，本可媲美龙萨，成为七星诗社最璀璨的星辰。事实上，伯爵大人非但不以为忤，反而颇感自豪，因为这位学识渊博、相貌堂堂的年轻人对伯爵夫人青眼有加。这位诗人早已啜饮过赫利孔山的灵泉，其婉转的田园诗与优雅的叙事谣曲在阿维罗涅以外的省份也渐负盛名。拉乌尔甚至对那些明显歌颂阿黛尔姿色的诗篇也毫不介怀——那些诗篇肆意描绘她葡萄酒般深暗的秀发、黄金般的眼眸，以及其他诱人的细节，这些无一不是女性完美的要素。伯爵大人从不自诩懂诗：和许多人一样，他认为诗歌与常识或世俗毫不相干；每当面对押韵合律的文字，他的心智便彻底瘫痪。与此同时，叙事诗与其作者正日渐大胆。\n\n那年，严冬的积雪在一周晴暖中消融殆尽，大地铺满早春柔嫩的绿意与黄绿宝石般的色彩。奥利维尔造访拉弗雷奈城堡愈发频繁，由于他们谈论的内容远超伯爵的兴趣与理解范围，他常与阿黛尔独处。如今，他们时而漫步于城堡周围的森林——那片涌动着春之绿海的森林几乎蔓延至灰色城墙与碉楼脚下，阳光温煦的林间空地中，初绽野花的芬芳正悄然浸染静谧的空气。即便有人闲言碎语，也谨慎地避开了拉乌尔、阿黛尔与奥利维尔的耳目。\n\n事态既已如此，很难说清伯爵大人为何突然开始怀疑自己婚姻的纯洁性。或许在他狩猎与饮酒的间隙——这两件事占据了他几乎所有时间——他注意到妻子正变得愈发年轻娇艳，容光焕发如沐浴在爱情魔幻阳光下的女子。或许他瞥见了阿黛尔与奥利维尔之间炽热或深情的默契眼神；又或许，是早春的气息刺穿了他酒意昏沉的头脑，唤起了某些被遗忘的思绪与情感的晦暗骚动，从而给了他片刻的洞察。无论如何，在这个四月初的下午，当他从维永办事归来，从仆人口中得知伯爵夫人与奥利维尔·杜蒙托瓦几分钟前刚去森林散步时，他感到不安。然而他呆滞的面容几乎未露端倪。他似乎沉思片刻，随后问道：\n\n\"他们往哪个方向去了？我有要事需立刻面见夫人。\"\n\n仆人指明了方向。他缓步沿着他们所指的小径走去，直到城堡消失在视野之外。随后他加快步伐，手指抚过佩剑剑柄，深入愈发茂密的树林。\n\n\"我有点害怕，奥利维尔。我们还要继续往前走吗？\"\n\n阿黛尔与奥利维尔已漫游至惯常散步范围的边界，正接近阿维罗涅森林中树木最为古老高大的区域。据说此处某些巨型橡树可追溯至异教时代。很少有人踏足此地；当地农民世代流传着关于这些树木的怪异信仰与传说。这片领域中出现过的事物，其存在本身既是对科学的亵渎，也是对宗教的悖逆；据说闯入这些古老林间空地阴沉树荫的人，会遭受邪恶力量的侵扰。传说纷纭，莫衷一是；但都认同这片森林中盘踞着某种对人类怀有敌意的存在，某种比基督或撒旦更古老的原始恶灵。恐慌、疯狂、恶魔附体，或是招致厄运的盲目激情，是踏入此灵领地之人的共同命运。有人低声谈论这灵体的真身，讲述关于其本质的荒诞故事，描述其真实样貌；但这些故事绝非虔诚基督徒的耳朵所能承受。\n\n\"求你了，我们继续走吧，\"奥利维尔说，\"您看，夫人，这些古树披上了四月的翠绿新装，它们在阳光下显得多么天真欢欣。\"\n\n\"可是那些传言，奥利维尔。\"\n\n\"那不过是吓唬孩子的故事。我们继续走吧。这里没有任何危险，只有无尽的美景令人陶醉。\"\n\n诚如他所言，枝干虬结的橡树与古老的榉树正焕发新叶的光彩。森林洋溢着欢愉与早春的喜悦，令人难以相信那些古老的迷信传说。在这样的日子里，心怀未言之爱的人们总渴望无尽地徜徉。于是，在几番女性特有的犹豫与多次安抚后，阿黛尔被奥利维尔说服，二人继续前行。\n\n兽径（若非人迹）延伸着他们走过的路，轻松通向这片充满邪恶传说的森林。低垂的枝条以柔软绿意环抱他们，仿佛要将他们拉入其中；阳光的金色光柱穿透高树，为盘曲巨根间盛开的隐秘百合镀上光环。这些树木扭曲多节，厚重的树皮积淀着百年沧桑，因岁月无名的生长而畸形臃肿；却透着古老的智慧与宁静的友善。阿黛尔欣喜地惊叹；她和奥利维尔都未察觉这片古老森林呈现的精致美景与盘错古怪中潜藏的任何险恶或不妥。\n\n\"我说得没错吧？\"奥利维尔问道，\"这些无害的树木花草有什么可畏惧的？\"\n\n阿黛尔微笑不答。在这片阳光明媚的空地上，她与奥利维尔以一种全新而弥漫的亲密对视。无风的空气中飘来一阵奇异的芬芳，来源难辨——这香气仿佛在隐秘地诉说着爱恋、倦怠与情欲的屈服。他们都不认得这花香，突然间，脚下涌现许多陌生的花朵：沉甸甸的铃形花透着肉欲的白或粉，卷曲缠绕的花瓣，或是如玫瑰色伤口般的花心。相视的瞬间，他们仿佛被突如其来的火焰眩目；血液剧烈加速，如同饮下了强力春药。奥利维尔眼中炽热的勇气与伯爵夫人脸颊羞涩的红晕，昭示着相同的念头。长久以来深藏心底、至今未宣之于口的爱意，此刻在两人血脉中急切地呐喊。他们继续前行；相同的尴尬与拘束令二人陷入沉默。\n\n他们不敢对视；也无人注意周遭森林渐变的气质；没人看见两侧聚集的灰白树干上污秽畸形的瘤节，阴影中昂起苍白斑点的可憎菌类，或是阳光下招摇的猩红淫艳花朵。爱欲的咒语笼罩着这对恋人；他们被情欲的曼德拉草麻醉；除了自己的身体、自己的心跳、自己狂乱奔涌的血液，一切都比梦境更模糊。\n\n林木愈发茂密，上方拱枝交织成多重幽暗。野兽的眼睛从隐蔽的洞穴中窥视，闪烁着狡黠的猩红或冰冷的凶暴绿光；淤塞着去秋落叶的死水散出阴湿气息，迎向阿黛尔与奥利维尔，稍稍打破了支配他们的危险魅惑。\n\n他们在岩石环绕的水潭边驻足，古老的赤杨在水潭上方交缠着腐朽的树冠，仿佛永远保持着癫狂老朽的疯态。就在那里，在新叶构成的赤杨低枝画框中，他们看见了那张斜睨他们的脸。\n\n这幻影令人难以置信；在漫长的屏息间，他们无法相信自己真的看见了它。在那半人半兽的脸上方，粗糙如兽毛的乱发中伸出两只角，斜裂的眼睛，獠牙外露的嘴，野猪鬃般的胡须。这张脸古老得难以估量；它的纹路与褶皱铭刻着无数荒淫岁月；它的眼神满载远古时代累积的恶意、腐朽与残忍。这是潘神的脸，当他从隐秘林间突袭毫无戒备的旅人时，正是这般模样。\n\n阿黛尔与奥利维尔被噩梦般的恐惧攫住，想起了那些古老传说。激情痴迷的咒语被打破，欲望的迷药松开了对他们感官的掌控。如同从沉睡中惊醒的人，他们看清了那张脸，在血液的轰鸣中听见一阵狂野、邪恶、令人恐慌的大笑，随着幻影消失在枝叶间。\n\n阿黛尔颤抖着，第一次投入爱人的怀抱。\n\n\"你看见了吗？\"她紧贴着他低语。\n\n奥利维尔将她搂紧。在这美妙的贴近中，他所见所闻的恐怖事物变得虚幻不实。必定有双重魔法在此作祟，如此平息他的恐惧；但他无从分辨那究竟是赤杨叶间阳光造成的短暂幻觉，还是传说中栖居阿维罗涅的恶魔；他所受的惊吓莫名失去了意义与缘由。他甚至要感谢这幻影——无论它是什么——因为它让阿黛尔投入了他的怀抱。此刻他只能想到那近在咫尺的温暖樱唇，他渴望已久。他开始安抚她，淡化她的恐惧，假装她什么都没看见；而这些安抚很快融入了炽热的爱意表白。他吻了她……两人都忘记了那萨提尔的幻影……\n\n当拉乌尔找到他们时，他们正躺在金色苔藓铺就的卧榻上，阳光透过高处叶隙的一道缝隙洒落。他们既未看见也未听见他驻足拔剑，面对着他们不伦幸福的景象。\n\n他正要扑向他们，一剑刺穿这对卧榻上的男女，这时发生了意想不到、几乎难以置信的事。一个棕毛生物——非人非兽，而是某种地狱般的混合体——以超自然的速度从赤杨枝间跃出，将阿黛尔从奥利维尔怀中夺走。奥利维尔与拉乌尔只瞥见它转瞬即逝的身影，事后谁都难以清晰描述。但那正是从叶间窥视恋人的脸；毛茸茸的腿与身体属于古老传说中的生物。它如同出现时一般不可思议地消失了，怀中抱着那女人；她惊恐的尖叫被它疯狂、恶魔般的大笑所淹没。\n\n尖叫声与大笑声在森林绿色的寂静中渐渐远去，再无声响。拉乌尔与奥利维尔只能完全呆滞地面面相觑。"

        "title_cn": "阿韦鲁瓦涅的幽会",
        "title": "A Rendezvous in Averoigne",
        "content": "\n\nGerard de l'Automne was meditating the rimes of a new ballade in honor of Fleurette, as he followed the leaf-arrased pathway toward Vyones through the woodland of Averoigne. Since he was on his way to meet Fleurette, who had promised to keep a rendezvous among the oaks and beeches like any peasant girl, Gerard himself made better progress than the ballade. His love was at that stage which, even for a professional troubadour, is more productive of distraction than inspiration; and he was recurrently absorbed in a meditation upon other than merely verbal felicities.\n\nThe grass and trees had assumed the fresh enamel of a mediaeval May; the turf was figured with little blossoms of azure and white and yellow, like an ornate broidery; and there was a pebbly stream that murmured beside the way, as if the voices of undines were parleying deliciously beneath its waters. The sun-lulled air was laden with a wafture of youth and romance; and the longing that welled from the heart of Gerard seemed to mingle mystically with the balsams of the wood.\n\nGerard was a trouvère whose scant years and many wanderings had brought him a certain renown. After the fashion of his kind he had roamed from court to court, from chateau to chateau; and he was now the guest of the Comte de la Frênaie, whose high castle held dominion over half the surrounding forest. Visiting one day that quaint cathedral town, Vyones, which lies so near to the ancient wood of Averoigne, Gerard had seen Fleurette, the daughter of a well-to-do mercer named Guillaume Cochin; and had become more sincerely enamored of her blonde piquancy than was to be expected from one who had been so frequently susceptible in such matters. He had managed to make his feelings known to her; and, after a month of billets-doux, ballades, and stolen interviews contrived by the help of a complaisant waiting-woman, she had made this woodland tryst with him in the absence of her father from Vyones. Accompanied by her maid and a man-servant, she was to leave the town early that afternoon and meet Gerard under a certain beech-tree of enormous age and size. The servants would then withdraw discreetly; and the lovers, to all intents and purposes, would be alone. It was not likely that they would be seen or interrupted; for the gnarled and immemorial wood possessed an ill repute among the peasantry. Somewhere in this wood there was the ruinous and haunted Chateau des Faussesflammes; and, also, there was a double tomb, within which the Sieur Hugh du Malinbois and his chatelaine, who were notorious for sorcery in their time, had lain unconsecrated for more than two hundred years. Of these, and their phantoms, there were grisly tales; and there were stories of loup-garous and goblins, of fays and devils and vampires that infested Averoigne. But to these tales Gerard had given little heed, considering it improbable that such creatures would fare abroad in open daylight. The madcap Fleurette had professed herself unafraid also; but it had been necessary to promise the servants a substantial pourboire, since they shared fully the local superstitions.\n\nGerard had wholly forgotten the legendry of Averoigne, as he hastened along the sun-flecked path. He was nearing the appointed beech-tree, which a turn of the path would soon reveal; and his pulses quickened and became tremulous, as he wondered if Fleurette had already reached the trysting-place. He abandoned all effort to continue his ballade, which, in the three miles he had walked from La Frenaie, had not progressed beyond the middle of a tentative first stanza.\n\nHis thoughts were such as would befit an ardent and impatient lover. They were now interrupted by a shrill scream that rose to an unendurable pitch of fear and horror, issuing from the green stillness of the pines beside the way. Startled, he peered at the thick branches; and as the scream fell back to silence, he heard the sound of dull and hurrying footfalls, and a scuffling as of several bodies. Again the scream arose. It was plainly the voice of a woman in some distressful peril. Loosening his dagger in its sheath, and clutching more firmly a long hornbeam staff which he had brought with him as a protection against the vipers which were said to lurk in Averoigne, he plunged without hesitation or premeditation among the low-hanging boughs from which the voice had seemed to emerge.\n\nIn a small open space beyond the trees, he saw a woman who was struggling with three ruffians of exceptionally brutal and evil aspect. Even in the haste and vehemence of the moment, Gerard realized that he had never before seen such men or such a woman. The woman was clad in a gown of emerald green that matched her eyes; in her face was the pallor of dead things, together with a faery beauty; and her lips were dyed as with the scarlet of newly flowing blood. The men were dark as Moors, and their eyes were red slits of flame beneath oblique brows with animal-like bristles. There was something very peculiar in the shape of their feet; but Gerard did not realize the exact nature of the peculiarity till long afterwards. Then he remembered that all of them were seemingly club-footed, though they were able to move with surpassing agility. Somehow, he could never recall what sort of clothing they had worn.\n\nThe woman turned a beseeching gaze upon Gerard as he sprang forth from amid the boughs. The men, however, did not seem to heed his coming; though one of them caught in a hairy clutch the hands which the woman sought to reach toward her rescuer.\n\nLifting his staff, Gerard rushed upon the ruffians. He struck a tremendous blow at the head of the nearest one a blow that should have levelled the fellow to earth. But the staff came down on unresisting air, and Gerard staggered and almost fell headlong in trying to recover his equilibrium. Dazed and uncomprehending, he saw that the knot of struggling figures had vanished utterly. At least, the three men had vanished; but from the middle branches of a tall pine beyond the open space, the death-white features of the woman smiled upon him for a moment with faint, inscrutable guile ere they melted among the needles.\n\nGerard understood now; and he shivered as he crossed himself. He had been deluded by phantoms or demons, doubtless for no good purpose; he had been the gull of a questionable enchantment. Plainly there was something after all in the legends he had heard, in the ill-renown of the forest of Averoigne.\n\nHe retraced his way toward the path he had been following. But when he thought to reach again the spot from which he had heard that shrill unearthly scream, he saw that there was no longer a path; nor, indeed, any feature of the forest which he could remember or recognize. The foliage about him no longer displayed a brilliant verdure; it was sad and funereal, and the trees themselves were either cypress-like, or were already sere with autumn or decay. In lieu of the purling brook there lay before him a tarn of waters that were dark and dull as clotting blood, and which gave back no reflection of the brown autumnal sedges that trailed therein like the hair of suicides, and the skeletons of rotting osiers that writhed above them.\n\nNow, beyond all question, Gerard knew that he was the victim of an evil enchantment. In answering that beguileful cry for succor, he had exposed himself to the spell, had been lured within the circle of its power. He could not know what forces of wizardry or demonry had willed to draw him thus; but he knew that his situation was fraught with supernatural menace. He gripped the hornbeam staff more tightly in his hand, and prayed to all the saints he could remember, as he peered about for some tangible bodily presence of ill.\n\nThe scene was utterly desolate and lifeless, like a place where cadavers might keep their tryst with demons. Nothing stirred, not even a dead leaf; and there was no whisper of dry grass or foliage, no song of birds nor murmuring of bees, no sigh nor chuckle of water. The corpse-grey heavens above seemed never to have held a sun; and the chill, unchanging light was without source or destination, without beams or shadows.\n\nGerard surveyed his environment with a cautious eye; and the more he looked the less he liked it: for some new and disagreeable detail was manifest at every glance. There were moving lights in the wood that vanished if he eyed them intently; there were drowned faces in the tarn that came and went like livid bubbles before he could discern their features. And, peering across the lake, he wondered why he had not seen the many-turreted castle of hoary stone whose nearer walls were based in the dead waters. It was so grey and still and vasty, that it seemed to have stood for incomputable ages between the stagnant tarn and the equally stagnant heavens. It was ancienter than the world, it was older than the light: it was coeval with fear and darkness; and a horror dwelt upon it and crept unseen but palpable along its bastions.\n\nThere was no sign of life about the castle; and no banners flew above its turrets or its donjon. But Gerard knew, as surely as if a voice had spoken aloud to warn him, that here was the fountainhead of the sorcery by which he had been beguiled. A growing panic whispered in his brain, he seemed to hear the rustle of malignant plumes, the mutter of demonian threats and plottings. He turned, and fled among the funereal trees.\n\nAmid his dismay and wilderment, even as he fled, he thought of Fleurette and wondered if she were awaiting him at their place of rendezvous, or if she and her companions had also been enticed and led astray in a realm of damnable unrealities. He renewed his prayers, and implored the saints for her safety as well as his own.\n\nThe forest through which he ran was a maze of bafflement and eeriness. There were no landmarks, there were no tracks of animals or men; and the swart cypresses and sere autumnal trees grew thicker and thicker as if some malevolent will were marshalling them against his progress. The boughs were like implacable arms that strove to retard him; he could have sworn that he felt them twine about him with the strength and suppleness of living things. He fought them, insanely, desperately, and seemed to hear a crackling of infernal laughter in their twigs as he fought. At last, with a sob of relief, he broke through into a sort of trail. Along this trail, in the mad hope of eventual escape, he ran like one whom a fiend pursues; and after a short interval he came again to the shores of the tarn, above whose motionless waters the high and hoary turrets of that time-forgotten castle were still dominant. Again he turned and fled; and once more, after similar wanderings and like struggles, he came back to the inevitable tarn.\n\nWith a leaden sinking of his heart, as into some ultimate slough of despair and terror, he resigned himself and made no further effort to escape. His very will was benumbed, was crushed down as by the incumbence of a superior volition that would no longer permit his puny recalcitrance. He was unable to resist when a strong and hateful compulsion drew his footsteps along the margent of the tarn toward the looming castle.\n\nWhen he came nearer, he saw that the edifice was surrounded by a moat whose waters were stagnant as those of the lake, and were mantled with the iridescent scum of corruption. The drawbridge was down and the gates were open, as if to receive an expected guest. But still there was no sign of human occupancy; and the walls of the great grey building were silent as those of a sepulcher. And more tomb-like even than the rest was the square and over-towering bulk of the mighty donjon.\n\nImpelled by the same power that had drawn him along the lakeshore, Gerard crossed the drawbridge and passed beneath the frowning barbican into a vacant courtyard. Barred windows looked blankly down; and at the opposite end of the court a door stood mysteriously open, revealing a dark hall. As he approached the doorway, he saw that a man was standing on the threshold; though a moment previous he could have sworn that it was untenanted by any visible form.\n\nGerard had retained his hornbeam staff; and though his reason told him that such a weapon was futile against any supernatural foe, some obscure instinct prompted him to clasp it valiantly as he neared the waiting figure on the sill.\n\nThe man was inordinately tall and cadaverous, and was dressed in black garments of a superannuate mode. His lips were strangely red, amid his bluish beard and the mortuary whiteness of his face. They were like the lips of the woman who, with her assailants, had disappeared in a manner so dubious when Gerard had approached them. His eyes were pale and luminous as marsh-lights; and Gerard shuddered at his gaze and at the cold, ironic smile of his scarlet lips, that seemed to reserve a world of secrets all too dreadful and hideous to be disclosed.\n\n\"I am the Sieur du Malinbois,\" the man announced. His tones were both unctuous and hollow, and served to increase the repugnance felt by the young troubadour. And when his lips parted, Gerard had a glimpse of teeth that were unnaturally small and were pointed like the fangs of some fierce animal.\n\n\"Fortune has willed that you should become my guest,\" the man went on. \"The hospitality which I can proffer you is rough and inadequate, and it may be that you will find my abode a trifle dismal. But at least I can assure you of a welcome no less ready than sincere.\"\n\n\"I thank you for your kind offer,\" said Gerard. \"But I have an appointment with a friend; and I seem in some unaccountable manner to have lost my way. I should be profoundly grateful if you would direct me toward Vyones. There should be a path not far from here; and I have been so stupid as to stray from it.\"\n\nThe words rang empty and hopeless in his own ears even as he uttered them; and the name that his strange host had given the Sieur du Malinbois was haunting his mind like the funereal accents of a knell; though he could not recall at that moment the macabre and spectral ideas which the name tended to evoke,\n\n\"Unfortunately, there are no paths from my chateau to Vyones,\" the stranger replied. \"As for your rendezvous, it will be kept in another manner, at another place, than the one appointed. I must therefore insist that you accept my hospitality. Enter, I pray; but leave your hornbeam staff at the door. You will have no need of it any longer.\"\n\nGerard thought that he made a moue of distaste and aversion with his over-red lips as he spoke the last sentences; and that his eyes lingered on the staff with an obscure apprehensiveness. And the strange emphasis of his words and demeanor served to awaken other phantasmal and macabre thoughts in Gerard's brain; though he could not formulate them fully till afterwards. And somehow he was prompted to retain the weapon, no matter how useless it might be against an enemy of spectral or diabolic nature. So he said:\n\n\"I must crave your indulgence if I retain the staff. I have made a vow to carry it with me, in my right hand or never beyond arm's reach, till I have slain two vipers.\"\n\n\"That is a queer vow,\" rejoined his host. \"However, bring it with you if you like. It is of no matter to me if you choose to encumber yourself with a wooden stick,\"\n\nHe turned abruptly, motioning Gerard to follow him. The troubadour obeyed unwillingly, with one rearward glance at the vacant heavens and the empty courtyard. He saw with no great surprise that a sudden and furtive darkness had closed in upon the chateau without moon or star, as if it had been merely waiting for him to enter before it descended. It was thick as the folds of a serecloth, it was airless and stifling like the gloom of a sepulcher that has been sealed for ages; and Gerard was aware of a veritable oppression, a corporeal and psychic difficulty in breathing, as he crossed the threshold.\n\nHe saw that cressets were now burning in the dim hall to which his host had admitted him; though he had not perceived the time and agency of their lighting. The illumination they afforded was singularly vague and indistinct, and the thronging shadows of the hall were unexplainably numerous, and moved with a mysterious disquiet; though the flames themselves were still as tapers that burn for the dead in a windless vault.\n\nAt the end of the passage, the Sieur du Malinbois flung open a heavy door of dark and somber wood. Beyond, in what was plainly the eating-room of the chateau, several people were seated about a long table by the light of cressets no less dreary and dismal than those in the hall. In the strange, uncertain glow, their faces were touched with a gloomy dubiety, with a lurid distortion; and it seemed to Gerard that shadows hardly distinguishable from the figures were gathered around the board. But nevertheless he recognized the woman in emerald green who had vanished in so doubtful a fashion amid the pines when Gerard answered her call for succor. At one side, looking very pale and forlorn and frightened, was Fleurette Cochin. At the lower end reserved for retainers and inferiors, there sat the maid and the man-servant who had accompanied Fleurette to her rendezvous with Gerard.\n\nThe Sieur du Malinbois turned to the troubadour with a smile of sardonic amusement.\n\n\"I believe you have already met everyone assembled,\" he observed. \"But you have not yet been formally presented to my wife, Agathe, who is presiding over the board. Agathe, I bring to you Gerard de l'Automne, a young troubadour of much note and merit.\"\n\nThe woman nodded slightly, without speaking, and pointed to a chair opposite Fleurette. Gerard seated himself, and the Sieur du Malinbois assumed according to feudal custom a place at the head of the table beside his wife.\n\nNow, for the first time, Gerard noticed that there were servitors who came and went in the room, setting upon the table various wines and viands. The servitors were preternaturally swift and noiseless, and somehow it was very difficult to be sure of their precise features or their costumes. They seemed to walk in an adumbration of sinister insoluble twilight. But the troubadour was disturbed by a feeling that they resembled the swart demoniac ruffians who had disappeared together with the woman in green when he approached them.\n\nThe meal that ensued was a weird and funereal affair. A sense of insuperable constraint, of smothering horror and hideous oppression, was upon Gerard; and though he wanted to ask Fleurette a hundred questions, and also demand an explanation of sundry matters from his host and hostess, he was totally unable to frame the words or to utter them. He could only look at Fleurette, and read in her eyes a duplication of his own helpless bewilderment and nightmare thralldom. Nothing was said by the Sieur du Malinbois and his lady, who were exchanging glances of a secret and baleful intelligence all through the meal; and Fleurette's maid and man-servant were obviously paralyzed by terror, like birds beneath the hypnotic gaze of deadly serpents.\n\nThe foods were rich and of strange savor; and the wines were fabulously old, and seemed to retain in their topaz or violet depths the unextinguished fire of buried centuries. But Gerard and Fleurette could barely touch them; and they saw that the Sieur du Malinbois and his lady did not eat or drink at all. The gloom of the chamber deepened; the servitors became more furtive and spectral in their movements; the stifling air was laden with unformulable menace, was constrained by the spell of a black and lethal necromancy. Above the aromas of the rare foods, the bouquets of the antique wines, there crept forth the choking mustiness of hidden vaults and embalmed centurial corruption, together with the ghostly spice of a strange perfume that seemed to emanate from the person of the chatelaine. And now Gerard was remembering many tales from the legendry of Averoigne, which he had heard and disregarded; was recalling the story of a Sieur du Malinbois and his lady, the last of the name and the most evil, who had been buried somewhere in this forest hundreds of years ago; and whose tomb was shunned by the peasantry, since they were said to continue their sorceries even in death. He wondered what influence had bedrugged his memory, that he had not recalled it wholly when he had first heard the name. And he was remembering other things and other stories, all of which confirmed his instinctive belief regarding the nature of the people into whose hands he had fallen. Also, he recalled a folklore superstition concerning the use to which a wooden stake can be put; and realized why the Sieur du Malinbois had shown a peculiar interest in the hornbeam staff. Gerard had laid the staff beside his chair when he sat down; and he was reassured to find that it had not vanished. Very quietly and unobtrusively, he placed his foot upon it.\n\nThe uncanny meal came to an end; and the host and his chatelaine arose.\n\n\"I shall now conduct you to your rooms,\" said the Sieur du Malinbois, including all of his guests in a dark, inscrutable glance.\n\n\"Each of you can have a separate chamber, if you so desire; or Fleurette Cochin and her maid Angelique can remain together; and the man-servant Raoul can sleep in the same room with Messire Gerard.\"\n\nA preference for the latter procedure was voiced by Fleurette and the troubadour. The thought of uncompanioned solitude in that castle of timeless midnight and nameless mystery was abhorrent to an insupportable degree.\n\nThe four were now led to their respective chambers, on opposite sides of a hall whose length was but indeterminately revealed by the dismal lights. Fleurette and Gerard bade each other a dismayed and reluctant good-night beneath the constraining eye of their host. Their rendezvous was hardly the one which they had thought to keep; and both were overwhelmed by the supernatural situation amid whose dubious horrors and ineluctable sorceries they had somehow become involved. And no sooner had Gerard left Fleurette than he began to curse himself for a poltroon because he had not refused to part from her side; and he marvelled at the spell of drug-like involition that had bedrowsed all his faculties. It seemed that his will was not his own, but had been thrust down and throttled by an alien power.\n\nThe room assigned to Gerard and Raoul was furnished with a couch, and a great bed whose curtains were of antique fashion and fabric. It was lighted with tapers that had a funereal suggestion in their form, and which burned dully in an air that was stagnant with the mustiness of dead years.\n\n\"May you sleep soundly,\" said the Sieur du Malinbois. The smile that accompanied and followed the words was no less unpleasant than the oily and sepulchral tone in which they were uttered. The troubadour and the servant were conscious of profound relief when he went out and closed the leaden-clanging door. And their relief was hardly diminished even when they heard the click of a key in the lock.\n\nGerard was now inspecting the room; and he went to the one window, through whose small and deep-set panes he could see only the pressing darkness of a night that was veritably solid, as if the whole place were buried beneath the earth and were closed in by clinging mould. Then, with an access of unsmothered rage at his separation from Fleurette, he ran to the door and hurled himself against it, he beat upon it with his clenched fists, but in vain. Realizing his folly, and desisting at last, he turned to Raoul.\n\n\"Well, Raoul,\" he said, \"what do you think of all this?\" Raoul crossed himself before he answered; and his face had assumed the vizard of a mortal fear.\n\n\"I think, Messire,\" he finally replied, \"that we have all been decoyed by a malefic sorcery; and that you, myself, the demoiselle Fleurette, and the maid Angelique, are all in deadly peril of both soul and body.\"\n\n\"That, also, is my thought,\" said Gerard. \"And I believe it would be well that you and I should sleep only by turns; and that he who keeps vigil should retain in his hands my hornbeam staff, whose end I shall now sharpen with my dagger. I am sure that you know the manner in which it should be employed if there are any intruders; for if such should come, there would be no doubt as to their character and their intentions. We are in a castle which has no legitimate existence, as the guests of people who have been dead, or supposedly dead, for more than two hundred years. And such people, when they stir abroad, are prone to habits which I need not specify.\"\n\n\"Yes, Messire,\" Raoul shuddered; but he watched the sharpening of the staff with considerable interest. Gerard whittled the hard wood to a lance-like point, and hid the shavings carefully. He even carved the outline of a little cross near the middle of the staff, thinking that this might increase its efficacy or save it from molestation. Then, with the staff in his hand, he sat down upon the bed, where he could survey the litten room from between the curtains.\n\n\"You can sleep first, Raoul.\" He indicated the couch, which was near the door.\n\nThe two conversed in a fitful manner for some minutes. After hearing Raoul's tale of how Fleurette, Angelique, and himself had been led astray by the sobbing of a woman amid the pines, and had been unable to retrace their way, the troubadour changed the theme. And henceforth he spoke idly and of matters remote from his real preoccupations, to fight down his torturing concern for the safety o f Fleurette. Suddenly he became aware that Raoul had ceased to reply; and saw that the servant had fallen asleep on the couch. At the same time an irresistible drowsiness surged upon Gerard himself in spite of all his volition, in spite of the eldritch terrors and forebodings that still murmured in his brain. He heard through his growing hebetude a whisper as of shadowy wings in the castle halls; he caught the sibilation of ominous voices, like those of familiars that respond to the summoning of wizards; and he seemed to hear, even in the vaults and towers and remote chambers, the tread of feet that were hurrying on malign and secret errands. But oblivion was around him like the meshes of a sable net; and it closed in relentlessly upon his troubled mind, and drowned the alarms of his agitated senses.\n\nWhen Gerard awoke at length, the tapers had burned to their sockets; and a sad and sunless daylight was filtering through the window. The staff was still in his hand; and though his senses were still dull with the strange slumber that had drugged them, he felt that he was unharmed. But peering between the curtains, he saw that Raoul was lying mortally pale and lifeless on the couch, with the air and look of an exhausted moribund.\n\nHe crossed the room, and stooped above the servant. There was a small red wound on Raoul's neck; and his pulses were slow and feeble, like those of one who has lost a great amount of blood. His very appearance was withered and vein-drawn. And a phantom spice arose from the couch a lingering wraith of the perfume worn by the chatelaine Agathe.\n\nGerard succeeded at last in arousing the man; but Raoul was very weak and drowsy. He could remember nothing of what had happened during the night; and his horror was pitiful to behold when he realized the truth.\n\n\"It will be your turn next, Messire,\" he cried. \"These vampires mean to hold us here amid their unhallowed necromancies till they have drained us of our last drop of blood. Their spells are like mandragora or the sleepy sirups of Cathay; and no man can keep awake in their despite.\"\n\nGerard was trying the door; and somewhat to his surprise he found it unlocked. The departing vampire had been careless, in the lethargy of her repletion. The castle was very still; and it seemed to Gerard that the animating spirit of evil was now quiescent; that the shadowy wings of horror and malignity, the feet that had sped on baleful errands, the summoning sorcerers, the responding familiars, were all lulled in a temporary slumber.\n\nHe opened the door, he tiptoed along the deserted hall, and knocked at the portal of the chamber allotted to Fleurette and her maid. Fleurette, fully dressed, answered his knock immediately; and he caught her in his arms without a word, searching her wan face with a tender anxiety. Over her shoulder he could see the maid Angelique, who was sitting listlessly on the bed with a mark on her white neck similar to the wound that had been suffered by Raoul. He knew, even before Fleurette began to speak, that the nocturnal experiences of the demoiselle and her maid had been identical with those of himself and the man-servant.\n\nWhile he tried to comfort Fleurette and reassure her, his thoughts were now busy with a rather curious problem. No one was abroad in the castle; and it was more than probable that the Sieur du Malinbois and his lady were both asleep after the nocturnal feast which they had undoubtedly enjoyed. Gerard pictured to himself the place and the fashion of their slumber; and he grew even more reflective as certain possibilities occurred to him.\n\n\"Be of good cheer, sweetheart,\" he said to Fleurette. \"It is in my mind that we may soon escape from this abominable mesh of enchantments. But I must leave you for a little and speak again with Raoul, whose help I shall require in a certain matter.\"\n\nHe went back to his own chamber. The man-servant was sitting on the couch and was crossing himself feebly and muttering prayers with a faint, hollow voice.\n\n\"Raoul,\" said the troubadour a little sternly, \"you must gather all your strength and come with me. Amid the gloomy walls that surround us, the somber ancient halls, the high towers and the heavy bastions, there is but one thing that veritably exists; and all the rest is a fabric of illusion. We must find the reality whereof I speak, and deal with it like true and valiant Christians. Come, we will now search the castle ere the lord and chatelaine shall awaken from their vampire lethargy.\"\n\nHe led the way along the devious corridors with a swiftness that betokened much forethought. He had reconstructed in his mind the hoary pile of battlements and turrets as he had seen them on the previous day; and he felt that the great donjon, being the center and stronghold of the edifice, might well be the place which he sought. With the sharpened staff in his hand, with Raoul lagging bloodlessly at his heels, he passed the doors of many secret rooms, the many windows that gave on the blindness of an inner court, and came at last to the lower story of the donjon-keep.\n\nIt was a large, bare room, entirely built of stone, and illumined only by narrow slits high up in the wall, that had been designed for the use of archers. The place was very dim; but Gerard could see the glimmering outlines of an object not ordinarily to be looked for in such a situation, that arose from the middle of the floor. It was a tomb of marble; and stepping nearer, he saw that it was strangely weather-worn and was blotched by lichens of grey and yellow, such as flourish only within access of the sun. The slab that covered it was doubly broad and massive, and would require the full strength of two men to lift.\n\nRaoul was staring stupidly at the tomb. \"What now, Messire?\" he queried.\n\n\"You and I, Raoul, are about to intrude upon the bedchamber of our host and hostess.\"\n\nAt his direction, Raoul seized one end of the slab; and he himself took the other. With a mighty effort that strained their bones and sinews to the cracking-point, they sought to remove it; but the slab hardly stirred. At length, by grasping the same end in unison, they were able to tilt the slab; and it slid away and dropped to the floor with a thunderous crash. Within, there were two open coffins, one of which contained the Sieur Hugh du Malinbois and the other his lady Agathe. Both of them appeared to be slumbering peacefully as infants; a look of tranquil evil, of pacified malignity, was imprinted upon their features; and their lips were dyed with a fresher scarlet than before.\n\nWithout hesitation or delay, Gerard plunged the lance-like end of his staff into the bosom of the Sieur du Malinbois. The body crumbled as if it were wrought of ashes kneaded and painted to human semblance; and a slight odor as of age-old corruption arose to the nostrils of Gerard. Then the troubadour pierced in like manner the bosom of the chatelaine. And simultaneously with her dissolution, the walls and floor of the donjon seemed to dissolve like a sullen vapor, they rolled away on every side with a shock as of unheard thunder. With a sense of weird vertigo and confusion Gerard and Raoul saw that the whole chateau had vanished like the towers and battlements of a bygone storm; that the dead lake and its rotting shores no longer offered their malefical illusions to the eye. They were standing in a forest glade, in the full unshadowed light of the afternoon sun; and all that remained of the dismal castle was the lichen-mantled tomb that stood open beside them. Fleurette and her maid were a little distance away; and Gerard ran to the mercer's daughter and took her in his arms. She was dazed with wonderment, like one who emerges from the night-long labyrinth of an evil dream, and finds that all is well.\n\n\"I think, sweetheart,\" said Gerard, \"that our next rendezvous will not be interrupted by the Sieur du Malinbois and his chatelaine.\"\n\nBut Fleurette was still bemused with wonder, and could only respond to his words with a kiss.",
        "content_cn": "杰拉德·德·洛托姆正酝酿着一首新歌谣的韵脚，以献给他心爱的芙洛蕾特。当他沿着落叶纷扬的小径穿越阿弗罗尼森林前往维奥讷时，这位行吟诗人满脑子都是与心上人幽会的场景。比起推敲诗句，他此刻更专注于加快脚步——毕竟芙洛蕾特已承诺像村姑般与他在橡树与山毛榉林间相会。即便是职业歌者，热恋中的心神激荡也远胜过创作灵感；他反复幻想着的，早已超越文字所能承载的欢愉。\n\n草木披着中世纪五月特有的鲜亮釉彩，缀满蓝白黄小花的草地宛如精工刺绣的挂毯。卵石溪流在道旁潺潺低语，恍若水泽仙女在水底窃窃私语。阳光熏暖的空气里飘荡着青春与传奇的芬芳，杰拉德胸中涌动的渴望似乎正与林间香脂神秘交融。\n\n这位年轻的游吟诗人虽年纪尚轻，却因漂泊四方而小有名气。他循着同行惯例辗转于各个城堡宫廷，如今正做客拉弗雷奈伯爵府邸——那座巍峨城堡统治着半片森林。某日在探访阿弗罗尼古林附近的维奥讷大教堂时，他遇见了布商纪尧姆·科雄的金发女儿芙洛蕾特。与惯常的风流韵事不同，这次他动了真情。经过一个月的情书、歌谣与侍女牵线的秘密约会，趁其父外出之际，少女终于答应与他林中相会。她将带着女仆与男仆于午后离城，在那棵闻名遐迩的古老山毛榉下等他。待仆人识趣退去，这对恋人便能独处。杰拉德并不担心被打扰——扭曲盘错的古木在当地农民口中凶名昭著。林间某处矗立着闹鬼的伪焰城堡，还有座双人墓穴，埋葬着以巫术闻名的于格·杜马林布瓦领主与其夫人，两百年来从未受过祝圣。关于这些亡灵精怪的恐怖传说在阿弗罗尼地区广为流传，但杰拉德不以为意，认为它们绝无可能光天化日现身。任性的芙洛蕾特虽自称胆大，却不得不许诺重赏才说服了迷信的仆从。\n\n当杰拉德匆匆穿过阳光斑驳的小径时，早将阿弗罗尼的传说抛诸脑后。随着路径转弯，那棵约定的古树即将映入眼帘。他脉搏加速，颤抖着猜测芙洛蕾特是否已至。从拉弗雷奈出发的三英里路程中，他连歌谣的第一段都没写完，此刻更是彻底放弃了创作。\n\n炽热焦躁的思绪突然被一声刺耳尖叫打断。恐怖的声浪撕破松林绿幕，惊得他急寻声源。尖叫戛然而止时，他听见杂乱脚步声与肢体扭打声。当尖叫再度响起，他毫不犹豫拔出匕首，紧握随身携带的角木杖（据说阿弗罗尼多毒蛇），冲进低垂的枝桠深处。\n\n林间空地上，三个面目狰狞的暴徒正与一位女子缠斗。即便情势危急，杰拉德仍注意到他们的异常：女子翠绿长裙映着同色眼眸，苍白面容带着妖精般的美艳，双唇如鲜血般猩红；三个黝黑如摩尔人的暴徒长着火焰般的红眼，眉骨突出如野兽。他们的脚形古怪——直到很久以后杰拉德才明白那竟是马蹄。女子向杰拉德投来求救目光时，暴徒们却对他的出现置若罔闻。\n\n杰拉德抡起木杖猛击最近暴徒的头部——本该将其击倒的力道却扑了空。踉跄间，他惊觉扭打的人影已消失无踪。空地边缘的松树高枝上，女子惨白的面容正对他露出诡秘微笑，旋即隐入针叶。\n\n杰拉德顿时醒悟，颤抖着画起十字。他被幻影或恶魔愚弄了，这片森林的凶名果然非虚。当他想退回原路时，却发现小径已消失。周遭林木褪去鲜绿，化作柏树般的阴郁枯黄。原本潺潺的溪流变成了凝血般的暗潭，倒映着枯芦苇如自缢者发丝般漂浮，腐烂柳枝如骸骨般虬曲。\n\n此刻他确信自己中了邪术。回应那蛊惑性呼救时，他已踏入魔法结界。不知是巫术还是恶魔作祟，但超自然的威胁真实存在。他攥紧木杖，默念所有记得的圣名，警惕地环视四周。\n\n这死寂之地宛如尸鬼与恶魔的幽会所。没有风拂枯叶，没有鸟鸣蜂吟，连水声都消弭无踪。尸灰色的天穹仿佛从未有过太阳，冰冷光线无源亦无终。越是观察，可怖细节越是显现：林间飘忽的幽光，潭底浮沉的惨白人脸。\n\n而潭水对岸，赫然矗立着多塔楼的古堡。灰白石墙扎根死水，仿佛自时间伊始就矗立于此，比世界更古老，比光明更悠久，与恐惧黑暗同龄。无形的恐怖盘踞在城垛上蠕动。没有旗帜，没有生命迹象，但杰拉德确信这就是邪术源头。恐慌如恶羽簌簌作响，他转身逃进送葬队列般的树林。\n\n奔逃中他想起芙洛蕾特——她是否仍在约定地点等候？抑或同样迷失在这可憎的虚妄之境？他边跑边为两人祈祷。\n\n森林化作诡谲迷宫。没有路标兽迹，黑柏与枯树愈发密集，枝桠如活物般缠绕阻拦。当他终于挣脱时，却再度回到古堡环伺的潭边。如此反复三次后，他绝望地屈服了。某种更强意志碾碎了他的反抗，迫使他沿潭岸走向森然古堡。\n\n护城河淤积着腐水，虹彩浮沫下吊桥却已放下。城门大开如迎贵宾，但石墙仍似墓穴般寂静。在无形力量驱使下，杰拉德穿过吊桥，步入空旷庭院。正厅门前突然现出人影——那是个身着古式黑衣的高瘦男子，青须衬着死白面容，红唇如林中女子般鲜艳，眼睛似沼泽磷火闪烁。\n\n\"我是马林布瓦领主。\"男子声音油腻空洞。当他咧嘴时，杰拉德瞥见野兽般的尖牙。\"命运注定您将成为我的客人。寒舍简陋，但欢迎绝对真诚。\"\n\n杰拉德借口赴约迷路请求指路，却听见自己声音空洞无力。马林布瓦这个姓氏如丧钟般在他脑海回响。\n\n\"我的城堡没有通往维奥讷的路。\"陌生人道，\"您的约会将以另一种形式，在别处实现。现在请务必接受款待——不过请将木杖留在门外。\"\n\n杰拉德注意到对方说最后几句时红唇微皱，目光在木杖上停留得可疑。他坚持依誓携带木杖，声称要杀死两条毒蛇。领主突然转身带路，杰拉德不情愿地跟随，发现城堡已被无星无月的黑暗吞噬。这黑暗如裹尸布般厚重，如千年古墓般窒息。跨过门槛时，他感到肉体与灵魂同时陷入了难以呼吸的压迫之中。\n\n他注意到昏暗的大厅里已燃起青铜灯盏，却不知主人是何时以何种方式点亮的。那灯火诡异地摇曳不定，挤满厅堂的阴影多得反常，正以令人不安的方式蠕动着——尽管灯焰本身静止如无风墓穴中的长明烛。\n\n走廊尽头，马林布瓦老爷推开一扇乌木雕花的阴沉门扉。宴会厅内，长桌旁围坐着数人，同样被青铜灯惨淡的光晕笼罩。在诡谲的光线下，他们的面容笼罩着阴森的犹疑与扭曲，杰拉德甚至分不清哪些是宾客哪些是阴影。但他认出了那位曾在松林间诡异消失的翠裙女子。面色惨白的芙勒蕾·科钦瑟缩在侧，她的女仆与男仆则坐在下首位置。\n\n马林布瓦转向吟游诗人，露出讥诮的笑容：\"看来诸位都是旧相识了。容我正式介绍主持宴席的内人阿加特——这位是声名鹊起的年轻吟游诗人，杰拉德·德·洛托纳。\"\n\n翠裙女子沉默地颔首，指向芙勒蕾对面的座位。当杰拉德落座时，他首次注意到那些穿梭上菜的仆役——他们动作快得反常且毫无声息，面容服饰皆朦胧难辨，仿佛行走在某种不祥的暮色里。诗人不安地察觉，这些仆役酷似当初与翠裙女子一同消失的那群黝黑暴徒。\n\n这场宴席弥漫着葬礼般的氛围。杰拉德被难以言喻的压抑感攫住，纵有千般疑问却发不出声音。他只能从芙勒蕾眼中读出与自己相同的恐惧。马林布瓦夫妇全程交换着诡秘的眼神，而芙勒蕾的仆人们则如被蛇盯住的雀鸟般僵直。\n\n珍馐美馔散发着古怪气息，陈年葡萄酒在杯中泛着墓穴般的幽光。杰拉德与芙勒蕾几乎无法下咽，而主人夫妇全程未动刀叉。随着阴影渐深，仆役们化作飘忽的幽灵，空气中弥漫着防腐香料与古老地窖的窒闷——其中混着女主人身上飘来的诡异馨香。\n\n此刻杰拉德突然想起阿维罗尼地区关于马林布瓦家族的传说：两百年前葬于林中的末代领主夫妇，据传死后仍施行邪术。他这才明白为何主人对他的角木杖如此在意。诗人悄悄用脚勾住放在椅边的木杖。\n\n宴席终了，主人起身宣布：\"我将引领诸位前往客房。芙勒蕾小姐可与女仆同住，杰拉德大人则与男仆劳尔共处一室。\"\n\n在阴森长廊分岔处，这对恋人被迫道别。杰拉德随即陷入自责——某种药物般的无力感竟让他顺从了分离的安排。他与劳尔被带入挂有丧葬式帷幔的房间，窗户外是凝实的黑暗，仿佛整座城堡深埋地底。\n\n当马林布瓦以滑腻如墓穴回响的嗓音道过晚安后，杰拉德立即检查门窗。发现房门竟未上锁时，他蹑足穿过寂静的走廊。芙勒蕾开门时脖颈已现出淡红伤痕，身后女仆颈间赫然印着同样标记。\n\n\"振作些，亲爱的。\"杰拉德轻抚恋人苍白的脸颊，\"我或许找到了脱身之法。\"他凝视着晨光中死气沉沉的城堡轮廓，某种关于吸血鬼安眠之地的古老传说正在他脑中成形。\n\n他回到自己的房间。那个男仆正坐在长椅上，虚弱地划着十字，用空洞微弱的声音喃喃祈祷。\n\n\"拉乌尔，\"游吟诗人略带严厉地说，\"你必须振作起来跟我走。在这环绕我们的阴森围墙、幽暗古厅、高耸塔楼与厚重城垛之间，唯有一样事物真实存在；其余皆是虚幻泡影。我们必须找到我说的那个真实之物，像真正勇敢的基督徒那样对付它。来吧，趁城堡主人与其夫人尚未从吸血鬼的昏睡中苏醒，我们现在就要搜查整座城堡。\"\n\n他沿着迂回走廊疾步前行，步伐之快显见早有筹谋。昨日所见那布满雉堞与角楼的灰暗建筑群，已在他脑海中重构；他感觉那座高大的主塔作为整座建筑的核心要塞，很可能就是他要寻找的地方。手握削尖的长杖，身后跟着面无血色的拉乌尔，他经过许多密室的门扉，经过那些朝向内院盲窗的窄窗，终于来到主塔底层。\n\n这是个空旷的石砌大厅，仅靠高墙上为弓箭手设计的狭窄箭孔采光。室内昏暗异常；但杰拉德能辨认出地板中央矗立着某件本不该出现在此处的物体轮廓。那是座大理石墓冢；走近细看，他发现墓碑异常风化，布满灰黄苔藓——这类地衣通常只生长在阳光能及之处。覆盖墓穴的石板格外宽厚，需要两个成年男子全力才能抬起。\n\n拉乌尔呆滞地盯着墓冢。\"现在怎么办，大人？\"他问道。\n\n\"你我二人，拉乌尔，即将造访主人夫妇的卧房。\"\n\n在他的指挥下，拉乌尔抓住石板一端，他自己握住另一端。随着骨骼肌腱几欲断裂的全力施为，他们试图移开石板；但那巨石纹丝不动。最终，两人合力扳动同一侧，终于将石板撬起；伴随着震耳欲聋的轰响，石板滑落地面。墓穴内并排放着两具敞开的棺材，其中躺着于格·杜·马林布瓦老爷与其夫人阿加特。两人如同婴儿般安详沉睡，面容凝固着平静的邪恶，一种餍足的狠毒；他们的嘴唇染着比先前更为鲜艳的猩红。\n\n杰拉德毫不犹豫地将长杖矛尖般的末端刺入杜·马林布瓦老爷的胸膛。那具躯体顿时溃散，仿佛是用灰烬塑成的人形；一股古老腐朽的淡淡气息窜入杰拉德的鼻腔。接着游吟诗人以同样方式刺穿了城堡女主人的胸膛。就在她形体消散的同时，主塔的墙壁与地面如同阴郁的雾气般开始溶解，在无声惊雷般的震荡中向四周坍落。伴随着诡异的眩晕与错乱感，杰拉德与拉乌尔目睹整座城堡如同往昔风暴中的塔楼城垛般消失无踪，死湖与腐朽湖岸不再向视线投射邪祟幻象。他们站在林间空地，沐浴在午后毫无阴影的阳光中；阴森城堡留下的唯一痕迹，只有身旁那座苔藓覆盖、已然洞开的墓冢。弗勒丽特和她的女仆站在不远处；杰拉德奔向绸缎商的女儿，将她拥入怀中。她恍若大梦初醒，如同刚从整夜噩梦迷宫中脱身，发现一切安好的人儿般满眼惊诧。\n\n\"亲爱的，\"杰拉德说，\"我想我们下次幽会时，杜·马林布瓦老爷和他夫人不会再来打扰了。\"\n\n但弗勒丽特仍沉浸在惊愕中，只能用亲吻回应他的话语。"

        "title_cn": "阿泽达莱克的圣洁",
        "title": "The Holiness of Azédarac",
        "content": "\n\n'By the Ram with a Thousand Ewes! By the Tail of Dagon and the Horns of Derceto!' said Azédarac, as he fingered the tiny, pot-bellied vial of vermilion liquid on the table before him. 'Something will have to be done with this pestilential Brother Ambrose. I have now learned that he was sent to Ximes by the Archbishop of Averoigne for no other purpose than to gather proof of my subterraneous connection with Azazel and the Old Ones. He has spied upon my evocations in the vaults, he has heard the hidden formulae, and beheld the veritable manifestation of Lilit, and even of Iog-Sotôt and Sodagui, those demons who are more ancient than the world; and this very morning, an hour agone, he has mounted his white ass for the return journey to Vyones. There are two ways — or, in a sense, there is one way — in which I can avoid the bother and inconvenience of a trial for sorcery: the contents of this vial must be administered to Ambrose before he has reached his journey's end — or, failing this, I myself shall be compelled to make use of a similar medicament.'\n\nJehan Mauvaissoir looked at the vial and then at Azédarac. He was not at all horrified, nor even surprised, by the non-episcopal oaths and the somewhat uncanonical statements which he had just heard from the Bishop of Ximes. He had known the Bishop too long and too intimately, and had rendered him too many services of an unconventional nature, to be surprised at anything. In fact, he had known Azédarac long before the sorcerer had ever dreamt of becoming a prelate, in a phase of his existence that was wholly unsuspected by the people of Ximes; and Azédarac had not troubled to keep many secrets from Jehan at any time.\n\n'I understand,' said Jehan. 'You can depend upon it that the contents of the vial will be administered. Brother Ambrose will hardly travel post-haste on that ambling white ass; and he will not reach Vyones before tomorrow noon. There is abundant time to overtake him. Of course, he knows me — at least, he knows Jehan Mauvaissoir.... But that can be easily remedied.'\n\nAzédarac smiled confidently. 'I leave the affair — and the vial — in your hands, Jehan. Of course, no matter what the eventuation, with all the Satanic and pre-Satanic facilities at my disposal, I should be in no great danger from these addlepated bigots. However, I am very comfortably situated here in Ximes; and the lot of a Christian Bishop who lives in the odor of incense and piety, and maintains in a meanwhile a private understanding with the Adversary, is certainly preferable to the mischancy life of a hedgesorcerer. I do not care to be annoyed or disturbed, or ousted from my sinecure, if such can be avoided.\n\n'May Moloch devour that sanctimonious little milksop of an Ambrose,' he went on. 'I must be growing old and dull, not to have suspected him before this. It was the horrorstricken and averted look he has been wearing lately that made me think he had peered through the keyhole on the subterranean rites. Then, when I heard he was leaving, I wisely thought to review my library; and I have found that the Book of Eibon, which contains the oldest incantations, and the secret, man-forgotten lore of Iog-Sotôt and Sodagui, is now missing. As you know, I had replaced the former binding of aboriginal, sub-human skin with the sheep-leather of a Christian missal, and had surrounded the volume with rows of legitimate prayer-books. Ambrose is carrying it away under his robe as proof conclusive that I am addicted to the Black Arts. No one in Averoigne will be able ta read the immemorial Hyperborean script; but the dragon's-blood illuminations and drawings will be enough to damn me.'\n\nMaster and servant regarded each other for an interval of significant silence. Jehan eyed with profound respect the haughty stature, the grimly lined lineaments, the grizzled tonsure, the odd, ruddy, crescent scar on the pallid brow of Azédarac, and the sultry points of orange-yellow fire that seemed to burn deep down in the chill and liquid ebon of his eyes. Azédarac, in his turn, considered with confidence the vulpine features and discreet, inexpressive air of Jehan, who might have been — and could be, if necessary — anything from a mercer to a cleric.\n\n'It is regrettable,' resumed Azédarac, 'that any question of my holiness and devotional probity should have been raised among the clergy of Averoigne. But I suppose it was inevitable sooner or later — even though the chief difference between myself and many other ecclesiastics is, that I serve the Devil wittingly and of my own free will, while they do the same in sanctimonious blindness.... However, we must do what we can to delay the evil hour of public scandal, and eviction from our neatly feathered nest. Ambrose alone could prove anything to my detriment at present; and you, Jehan, will remove Ambrose to a realm wherein his monkish tattlings will be of small consequence. After that, I shall be doubly vigilant. The next emissary from Vyones, I assure you, will find nothing to report but saintliness and bead-telling.'\n\nII\n\nThe thoughts of Brother Ambrose were sorely troubled, and at variance with the tranquil beauty of the sylvan scene, as he rode onward through the forest of Averoigne between Ximes and Vyones. Horror was nesting in his heart like a knot of malignant vipers; and the evil Book of Eibon, that primordial manual of sorcery, seemed to burn beneath his robe like a huge, hot, Satanic sigil pressed against his bosom. Not for the first time, there occurred to him the wish that Clément, the Archbishop, had delegated someone else to investigate the Erebean turpitude of Azédarac. Sojourning for a month in the Bishop's household, Ambrose had learned too much for the peace of mind of any pious cleric, and had seen things that were like a secret blot of shame and terror on the white page of his memory. To find that a Christian prelate could serve the powers of nethermost perdition, could entertain in privity the foulnesses that are older than Asmodai, was abysmally disturbing to his devout soul; and ever since then he had seemed to smell corruption everywhere, and had felt on every side the serpentine encroachment of the dark Adversary.\n\nAs he rode on among the somber pines and verdant beeches, he wished also that he were mounted on something swifter than the gentle, milk-white ass appointed for his use by the Archbishop. He was dogged by the shadowy intimation of leering gargoyle faces, of invisible cloven feet, that followed him behind the thronging trees and along the umbrageous meanderings of the road. In the oblique rays, the elongated webs of shadow wrought by the dying afternoon, the forest seemed to attend with bated breath the noisome and furtive passing of innominable things. Nevertheless, Ambrose had met no one for miles; and he had seen neither bird nor beast nor viper in the summer woods.\n\nHis thoughts returned with fearful insistence to Azédarac, who appeared to him as a tall, prodigious Antichrist, uprearing his sable vans and giant figure from out the flaming mire of Abaddon, Again he saw the vaults beneath the Bishop's mansion, wherein he had peered one night on a scene of infernal terror and loathliness, had beheld the Bishop swathed in the gorgeous, coiling fumes of unholy censers, that mingled in midair with the sulfurous and bituminous vapors of the Pit; and through the vapors had seen the lasciviously swaying limbs, the bellying and dissolving features of foul enormous entities.... Recalling them, again he trembled at the pre-Adamite lubriciousness of Lilit, again he shuddered at the trans-galactic horror of the demon Sodagui, and the ultra-dimensional hideousness of that being known as Iog-Sotôt to the sorcerers of Averoigne.\n\nHow balefully potent and subversive, he thought, were these immemorial devils, who had placed their servant Azédarac in the very bosom of the Church, in a position of high and holy trust. For nine years the evil prelate had held an unchallenged and unsuspected tenure, had befouled the bishopric of Ximes with infidelities that were worse than those of the Paynims. Then, somehow, through anonymous channels, a rumour had reached Clément — a warning whisper that not even the Archbishop had dared to voice aloud; and Ambrose, a young Benedictine monk, the nephew of Clément, had been dispatched to examine privily the festering foulness that threatened the integrity of the Church. Only at that time did anyone recall how little was actually known regarding the antecedents of Azédarac; how tenuous were his claims to ecclesiastical preferment, or even to mere priestship; how veiled and doubtful were the steps by which he had attained his office. It was then realized that a formidable wizardry had been at work.\n\nUneasily, Ambrose wondered if Azédarac had already discovered the removal of the Book of Eibon from among the missals contaminated by its blasphemous presence. Even more uneasily, he wondered what Azédarac would do in that event, and how long it would take him to connect the absence of the volume with his visitor's departure.\n\nAt this point, the meditations of Ambrose were interrupted by the hard clatter of galloping hoofs that approached from behind. The emergence of a centaur from the oldest wood of paganism could scarcely have startled him to a keener panic; and he peered apprehensively over his shoulder at the nearing horseman. This person, mounted on a fine black steed with opulent trappings, was a bushy-bearded of obvious consequence; for his gay garments were those of a noble or a courtier. He overtook Ambrose and passed on with a polite nod, seeming to be wholly intent on his own affairs. The monk was immensely reassured, though vaguely troubled for some moments by a feeling that he had seen elsewhere, under circumstances which he was unable to recall, the narrow eyes and sharp profile that contrasted so oddly with the bluff beard of the horseman. However, he was comfortably sure that he had never seen the man in Ximes. The rider soon vanished beyond a leafy turn of the arboreal highway. Ambrose returned to the pious horror and apprehensiveness of his former soliloquy.\n\nAs he went on, it seemed to him that the sun had gone down with untimely and appalling swiftness. Though the heavens above were innocent of cloud, and the low-lying air was free from vapors, the woods were embrowned by an inexplicable gloom that gathered visibly on all sides. In this gloom, the trunks of the trees were strangely distorted, and the low masses of foliage assumed unnatural and disquieting forms. It appeared to Ambrose that the silence around him was a fragile film through which the raucous rumble and mutter of diabolic voices might break at any moment, even as the foul and sunken driftage that rises anon above the surface of a smoothly flowing river.\n\nWith much relief, he remembered that he was not far from a wayside tavern, known as the Inn of Bonne Jouissance. Here, since his journey to Vyones was little more than half completed, he resolved to tarry for the night.\n\nA minute more, and he saw the lights of the inn. Before their benign and golden radiance, the equivocal forest shadows that attended him seemed to halt and retire and he gained the haven of the tavern courtyard with the feeling of one who has barely escaped from an army of goblin perils.\n\nCommitting his mount to the care of a stable-servant, Ambrose entered the main room of the inn. Here he was greeted with the deference due to his cloth by the stout and unctuous taverner; and, being assured that the best accommodations of the place were at his disposal, he seated himself at one of several tables where other guests had already gathered to await the evening meal.\n\nAmong them, Ambrose recognized the bluff-bearded horseman who had overtaken him in the woods an hour agone. This person was sitting alone, and a little apart. The other guests, a couple of travelling mercers, a notary, and two soldiers, acknowledged the presence of the monk with all due civility; but the horseman arose from his table, and coming over to Ambrose, began immediately to make overtures that were more than those of common courtesy.\n\n'Will you not dine mth me, sir monk?' he invited, in a gruff but ingratiating voice that was perplexingly familiar to Ambrose, and yet, like the wolfish profile, was irrecognizable at the time.\n\n'I am the Sieur des Émaux, from Touraine, at your service,' the man went on. 'It would seem that we are traveliag the same road — possibly to the same destination. Mine is the cathedral city of Vyones. And yours?'\n\nThough he was vaguely perturbed, and even a little suspicious, Ambrose found himself unable to decline the invitation. In reply to the last question, he admitted that he also was on his way to Vyones. He did not altogether like the Sieur des Émaux, whose slitted eyes gave back the candle-light of the inn with a covert glitter, and whose manner was somewhat effusive, not to say fulsome. But there seemed to be no ostensible reason for refusing a courtesy that was doubtless well-meant and genuine. He accompanied his host to their separate table.\n\n'You belong to the Benedictine order, I observe,' said the Sieur des Émaux, eyeing the monk with an odd smile that was tinged with furtive irony. 'It is an order that I have always admired greatly — a most noble and worthy brotherhood. May I not inquire your name?'\n\nAmbrose gave the requested information with a curious reluctance.\n\n'Well, then, Brother Ambrose,' said the Sieur des Émaux, 'I suggest that we drink to your health and the prosperity of your order in the red wine of Averoigne while we are waiting for supper to be served. Wine is always welcome following a long journey, and is no less beneficial before a good meal than after.'\n\nAmbrose mumbled an unwilling assent. He could not have told why, but the personality of the man was more and more distasteful to him. He seemed to detect a sinister undertone in the purring voice, to surprise an evil meaning in the low-lidded glance. And all the while his brain was tantalized by intimations of a forgotten memory. Had he seen his interlocutor in Ximes? Was the self-styled Sieur des Émaux a henchman of Azédarac in disguise?\n\nWine was now ordered by his host, who left the table to confer with the innkeeper for this purpose, and even insisted on paying a visit to the cellar, that he might select a suitable viatage in person. Noting the obeisance paid to the man by the people of the tavern, who addressed him by name, Anbrose felt a certain measure of reassurance. When the taverner, followed by the Sieur des Émaux, returned with two earthen pitchers of wine, he had well-nigh succeeded in dismissing his vague doubts and vaguer fears. Two large goblets were now placed on the table, and the Sieur des Émaux filled them immediately from one of the pitchers. It seemed to Ambrose that the first of the goblets already contained a small amount of some sanguine fluid, before the wine was poured into it; but he could not have sworn to this in the dim light, and thaught that he must have been mistaken.\n\n'Here are two matchless vintages,' said the Sieur des Émaux, indicating the pitchers. 'Both are so excellent that I was unable to choose between them; but you, Brother Ambrose, are perhaps capable of deciding their merits with a finer palate than mine.'\n\nHe pushed one of the filled goblets toward Ambrose. 'This is the wine of La Frenaie,' he said. 'Drink, it will verily transyort you from the world by virtue of the mighty fire that slumbers in its heart.'\n\nAmbrose took the profFered goblet, and raised it to his lips. The Sieur des Émaux was bending forward above his own wine to inhale its bouquet; and something in his posture was terrifyingly familiar to Ambrose. In a chill flash of horror, his memory told him that the thin, pointed features behind the square beard were dubiously similar to those of Jehan Mauvaissoir, whom he had often seen in the household of Azédarac, and who, as he had reason to believe, was implicated in the Bishop's sorceries. He wondered why he had not placed the resemblance before, and what wizardry had drugged his powers of recollection. Even now he was not sure; but the mere suspicion terrified him as if some deadly serpent had reared its head across the table.\n\n'Drink, Brother Ambrose,' urged the Sieur des Émaux, draining his own goblet. 'To your welfare and that of all good Benedictines.'\n\nAmbrose hesitated. The cold, hypnotic eyes of his interlocutor were upon him, and he was powerless to refuse, in spite of all his apprehensions. Shuddering slightly, with the sense of some irresistible compulsion, and feeling that he might drop dead from the virulent working of a sudden poison, he emptied his goblet.\n\nAn instant more, and he felt that his worst fears had been justified. The wine burned like the liquid flames of Phlegeton in his throat and on his lips; it seemed to fill his veins with a hot, infernal quicksilver. Then, all at once, an unbearable cold had inundated his being; an icy whirlwind wrapped him round with coils of roaring air, the chair melted beneath him, and he was falling through endless glacial gulfs. The walls of the inn had flown like receding vapors; the lights went out like stars in the black mist of a marish; and the face of the Sieur des Émaux faded with them on the swirling shadows, even as a bubble that breaks on the milling of midnight waters.\n\nIII\n\nIt was with some difficulty that Ambrose assured himself that he was not dead. He had seemed to fall eternally, through a gray night that was peopled with ever-changing forms, with blurred unstable masses that dissolved to other masses before they could assume definitude. For a moment, he thought there were walls about him once more; and then he was plunging fron terrace to terrace of a world of phantom trees. At whiles, he thought also that there were human faces; but all was doubtful and evanescent, all was drifting smoke and surging shadow.\n\nAbruptly, with no sense of transition or impact, he found that he was no longer falling. The vague fantasmagoria around him had returned to an actual scene — but a scene in which there was no trace of the Inn of Bonne Jouissance, or the Sieur des Émaux.\n\nAmbrose peered about with incredulous eyes on a situation that was truly unbelievable. He was sitting in broad daylight on a large square block of roughly hewn granite. Around him, at a little distance, beyond the open space of a grassy glade, were the lofty pines and spreading beeches of an elder forest, whose boughs were already touched by the gold of the declining sun. Immediately before him, several men were standing.\n\nThese men appeared to regard Ambrose with a profound and almost religious amazement. They were bearded and savage of aspect, with white robes of a fashion he had never before seen. Their hair was long and matted, like tangles of black snakes; and their eyes burned with a frenetic fire. Each of them bore in his right hand a rude knife of sharply chiselled stone.\n\nAmbrose wondered if he had died after all, and if these beings were the strange devils of some unlisted hell. In the face of what had happened, and the light of Ambrose's own beliefs, it was a far from unreasanable conjecture. He peered with fearful trepidation at the supposed demons, and began to mumble a prayer to the God who had aban- doned him so inexplicably to his spiritual foes. Then he remembered the necromantic powers of Azédarac, and conceived another surmise — that he had been spirited bodily away from the Inn of Bonne Jouissance, and delivered into the hands of those pre-Sataaic entities that served the sorcerous Bishop. Becoming convinced of his own physical solidity and integrity, and reflecting that such was scarcely the appropriate condition of a disincarnate soul, and also that the sylvan scene about him was hardly characteristic of the infernal regions, he accepted this as the true explanation. He was still alive, and still on earth, though the circumstances of his situation were more than mysterious, and were fraught with dire, unknowable danger.\n\nThe strange beings had maintained an utter silence, as if they were too dumbfounded for speech. Hearing the prayerful nurmurs of Ambrose, they seemed to recover from their surprise, and became not only articulate but vociferous. Ambrose could make nothing of their harsh vocables, in which sibilants and aspirates and gutturals were often combined in a manner difficult for the normal human tongue to imitate. However, he caught the word 'taranit', several times repeated, and wondered if it were the name of an especially malevolent demon.\n\nThe speech of the weird beings began to assume a sort of rude rhythm, like the intonations of some primordial chant. Two of them stepped forward and seized Ambrose, while the voices of their companions rose in a shrill, triumphant litany.\n\nScarcely knowing what had happened, and still less what was to follow, Ambrose was flung supine on the granite block, and was held down by one of his captors, while the other raised aloft the keen blade of chiselled flint which he carried. The blade was poised in the air above Ambrose's heart, and the monk realized in sudden terror that it would fall with dire velocity and pierce him through before the lapse of another moment.\n\nThen, above the demoniac chanting, which had risen to a mad, malignant frenzy, he heard the sweet and imperious cry of a woman's voice. In the wild confusion of his terror, the words were strange and meaningless to him; but plainly they were understood by his captors, and were taken as an undeniable command. The stone knife was lowered sullenly, and Ambrose was permitted to resume a sitting posture on the flat slab.\n\nHis rescuer was standing on the edge of the open glade, in the wide-flung umbrage of an ancient pine. She came forward now; and the white-garmented beings fell back with evident respect before her. She was very tall, with a fearless and regal demeanor, and was gowned in a dark shimmering blue, like the star-laden blue of nocturnal summer skies. Her hair was knotted in a long golden-brown braid, heavy as the glistening coils of some eastern serpcnt. Her eyes were a strange amber, her lips a vermilion touched with the coolness of woodland shadow, and her skin was of alabastrine fairness. Ambrose saw that she was beautiful; but she inspired him with the same awe that he would have felt before a queen, together with something of the fear and consternation which a virtuous young monk would conceive in the perilous presence of an alluring succubus.\n\n'Come with me,' she said to Ambrose, in a tongue that his monastic studies enabled him to recognize as an obsolete variant of the French of Averoigne — a tongue that no man had supposedly spoken for many hundred years. Obediently and in great wonder, he arose and followed her, with no hindrance from his glowering and reluctant captors.\n\nThe woman led him to a narrow path that wound sinuously away through the deep forest. In a few moments, the glade, the granite block, and the cluster of white-robed men were lost to sight behind the heavy foliage.\n\n'Who are you?' asked the lady, turning to Ambrose. 'You look like one of those crazy missionaries who are beginning to enter Averoigne nowadays. I believe that people call them Christians. The Druids have sacrificed so many of them to Taranit, that I marvel at your temerity in coming here.'\n\nAmbrose found it difficult to comprehend the archaic phrasing; and the import of her words was so utterly strange and baffling that he felt sure he must have misunderstood her.\n\n'I am Brother Ambrose,' he replied, expressing himself slowly and awkwardly in the long-disused dialect. 'Of course, I am a Christian; but I confess that I fail to understand you. I have heard of the pagan Druids; but surely they were all driven from Averoigne many centuries ago.'\n\nThe woman stared at Ambrose, with open amazement and pity. Her brownish-yellow eyes were bright and clear as a mellowed wine.\n\n'Poor little one,' she said. 'I fear that your dreadful experiences have served to unsettle you. It was fortunate that I came aIong when I did, and decided to intervene. I seldom interfere with the Druids aud their sacrifices; but I saw you sitting on their altar a little while agone, and was struck by your youth and comeliness.'\n\nAmbrose felt more and more that he had been made the victim of a most peculiar sorcery; but, even yet, he was far from suspecting the true magnitude of this sorcery. Amid his bemusement and consternation, however, he realized that he owed his life to the singular and lovely woman beside him, and began to stammer out his gratitude.\n\n'You need not thank me,' said the lady, with a dulcet smile. 'I am Moriamis, the enchantress, and the Druids fear my magic, which is more sovereign and more excellent than theirs, though I use it only for the welfare of men and not for their bale or bane.' The monk was dismayed to learn that his fair rescuer was a sorceress, even though her powers were professedly benignant. The knowledge added to his alarm; but he felt that it would be politic to conceal his emotions in this regard.\n\n'Indeed, I am grateful to you,' he protested. 'And now, if you can tell me the way to the Inn of Bonne Jouissance, which I left not long ago, I shall owe you a further debt.' Moriamis knitted her light brows. 'I have never heard of the Inn of Bonne Jouissance. There is no such place in this region.'\n\n'But this is the forest of Averoigne, is it not?' inquired the puzzled Ambrose. 'And surely we are not far from the road that runs between the town of Ximes and the city of Vyones?'\n\n'I have never heard of Ximes, or Vyones, either,' said Moriamis. 'Truly, the land is known as Averoigne, and this forest is the great wood of Averoigne, which men have called by that name from primeval years. But there are no towns such as the ones whereof you speak, Brother Ambrose. I fear that you still wander a little in your mind.' Ambrose was aware of a maddening perplexity. 'I have been most damnably beguiled,' he said, half to himself. 'It is all the doing of that abominable sorcerer, Azédarac, I am sure.\n\nThe woman started as if she had been stung by a wild bee. There was something both eager and severe in the searching gaze that she turned upon Ambrose.\n\n'Azédarac?' she queried. 'What do you know of Azédarac? I was once acquainted with someone by that name; and I wonder if it could be the same person. Is he tall and a little gray, with hot, dark eyes, and a proud, half-angry air, and a crescent scar on the brow?'\n\nGreatly mystified, and more troubled than ever, Ambrose admitted the veracity of her description. Realizing that in same unknown way he had stumbled upon the hidden antecedents of the sorcerer, he confided the story of his adventures to Moriamis, hoping that she would reciprocate with further information concerning Azédarac.\n\nThe woman listened with the air of one who is much interested but not at all surprised.\n\n'I understand now,' she observed, when he had finished. Anon I shall explain everything that mystifies and troubles you. I think I know this Jehan Mauvaissoir, also; he has long been the man-servant of Azédarac, though his name was Melchire in other days. These two have always been the underlings of evil, and have served the Old Ones in ways forgotten or never known by the Druids.'\n\n'Indeed, I hope you can explain what has happened,' said Ambrose. 'It is a fearsome and strange and ungodly thing, to drink a draft of wine in a tavern at eventide, and then find one's self in the heart of the forest by afternoon daylight, among demons such as those from whom you succored me.'\n\n'Yea,' countered Moriamis 'it is even stranger than you dream. Tell me, Brother Ambrose, what was the year in which you entered the Inn of Bonne Jouissance?'\n\n'Why, it is the year of our Lord, 1175, of course. What other year could it be?'\n\n'The Druids use a different chronology,' replied Moriamis, 'and their notation would mean nothing to you. But, according to that which the Christian missionaries would now introduce in Averoigne, the present year is A.D. 475. You have been sent back no less than seven hundred years into what the people of your era would regard as the past. The Druid altar an which I found you lying is probably located on the future site of the Inn of Bonne Jouissance.'\n\nAmbrose was more than dumbfounded. His mind was unable to grasp the entire import of Moriamis' words.\n\n'But how can such things be'?' he cried. 'How can a man go backward in time, among years and people that have long turned to dust?'\n\n'That, mayhap, is a mystery for Azédarac to unriddle. However, the past and the future co-exist with what we call the present, and are merely the two segments of the circle of time. We see them and name them according to our own position in the circle.'\n\nAmbrose felt that he had fallen among necromancies of a most unhallowed and unexampled sort, and had been made the victim of diableries unknown to the Christian catalogues.\n\nTongue-tied by a consciousness that all comment, all protest or even prayer would prove inadequate to the situation, he saw that a stone tower with small lozenge-shaped windows was now visible above the turrets of pine along the path which he and Moriamis were following.\n\n'This is my home,' said Moriamis, as they came forth from beneath the thinning trees at the foot of a little knoll on which the tower was situated. 'Brother Ambrose, you must be my guest.'\n\nAmbrose was unable to decline the proffered hospitality, in spite of his feeling that Moriamis was hardly the most suitable of chatelaines for a chaste and God-fearing monk. However, the pious misgivings with which she inspired him were not unmingled with fascination. Also, like a lost child, he clung to the only available protection in a land of fearful perils and astounding mysteries.\n\nThe interior of the tower was neat and clean and homelike, though with furniture of a ruder sort than that to which Ambrose was accustomed, and rich but roughly woven arrases. A serving-woman, tall as Moriamis herself, but darker, brought to him a huge bowl of milk and wheaten bread, and the monk was now able to assuage the hunger that had gone unsatisfied in the Inn of Bonne Jouissance.\n\nAs he seated himself before the simple fare, he realized that the Book of Eibon was still heavy in the bosom of his gown. He removed the volume, and gave it gingerly to Moriamis. Her eyes widened, but she made no comment until he had finished his meal. Then she said:\n\n'This volume is indeed the property of Azédarac, who was formerly a neighbor of mine. I knew the scoundrel quite well — in fact, I knew him all too well.' Her bosom heaved with an obscure emotion as she paused for a moment. 'He was the wisest and the mightiest of sorcerers, and the most secret withal; for no one knew the time and the manner of his coming into Averoigne, or the fashion in which he had procured the immemorial Book of Eibon, whose runic writings were beyond the lore of all other wizards. He was master of all enchantments and all demons, and likewise a compounder of mighty potions. Among these were certain philtres, blended with potent spells and possessed of unique virtue, that would send the drinker backward or forward in time. One of them, I believe, was administered to you by Melchire, or Jehan Mauvaissoir; and Azédarac himself, together with this man-servant, made use of another — perhaps not for the first time — when they went onward from the presemt age of the Druids into that age of Christian authority to which you belong. There was a blood-red vial for the past, and a green for the future. Behold! I possess one of each — though Azédarac was unaware that I knew of their existence.'\n\nShe opened a little cupboard, in which were the various charms and medicaments, the sun-dried herbs and mooncompounded essences that a sorceress would employ. From among them she brought out the two vials, one of which contained a sanguine-colored liquid, and the other a fluid of emerald brightness.\n\n'I stole them one day, out of womanly curiosity, from his hidden store of philtres and elixirs and nagistrals,' continued Moriamis. 'I could have followed the rascal when he disappeared into the future, if I had chosen to do so. But I am well enough content with ny own age; and moreover, I am not the sort of woman who pursues a wearied and reluctant lover....'\n\n'Then,' said Ambrose, more bewildered than ever, but hopeful, 'if I were to drink the contents of the green vial, I should return to my own epoch.'\n\n'Precisely. And I am sure, from what you have told me, that your return would be a source of much annoyance to Azédarac. It is like the fellow, to have established himself in a fat prelacy. He was ever the master of circumstance, with an eye to his own accommodation and comfort. It would hardly please him, I am sure, if you were to reach the Archbishop.... I am not revengeful by nature ... but on the other hand — '\n\n'It is hard to understand how anyone could have wearied of you,' said Ambrose, gallantly, as he began to comprehend the situation.\n\nMoriamis smiled. 'That is prettily said. And you are really a charming youth, in spite of that dismal-looking robe. I am glad that I rescued you from the Druids, who would have torn your heart out and offered it to their demon, Taranit.'\n\n'And now you will send me back7'\n\nMoriamis frowned a little, and then assumed her most seductive air.\n\n'Are you in such a hurry to leave your hostess? Now that you are living in another century than your own, a day, a week, or a month will make no difference in the date of your return. I have also retained the formulas of Azédarac; and I know how to graduate the potion, if necessary. The usual period of transportation in time is exactly seven huadred years; but the philtre can be strengthened or weakened a little.'\n\nThe sun had fallen beyond the pines, and a soft twilight was beginning to invade the tower. The maid-servant had left the room. Moriamis cane over and seated herself beside Ambrose on the rough bench he was occupying. Still smiling, she fixed her amber eyes uyon him, with a languid flame in their depths — a flame that seemed to brighten as the dusk grew stronger. Without speaking, she began slowly to unbraid her heavy hair, from which there emanated a perfume that was subtle and delicious as the perfume of grape-flowers.\n\nAmbrose was embarrassed by this delightful proximity. 'I am not sure that it would be right for me to remain, after all. What would the Archbishop think?'\n\n'My dear child. the Archbishop will not even be born for at least six hundred and fifty years. And it will be still longer before you are born. And when you return, anything that you have done during your stay with me will have happened no less than seven centuries ago ... which should be long enough to procure the remission of any sin, no matter how often repeated.'\n\nLike a man who has been taken in the toils of some fantastic drean, and finds that the dream is not altogether disagreeable, Ambrose yielded to this feminine and irrefutable reasoning. He hardly knew what was to happen; but, under the exceptional circumstances indicated by Moriamis, the rigors of monastic discipline might well be relaxed to almost any conceivable degree, without entailing spiritual perdition or even a serious breach of vows.\n\nIV\n\nA month Iater, Moriamis and Ambrose were standing beside the Druid altar. It was late in the evening; and a slightly gibbous moon had risen upon the deserted glade and was fringing the tree-tops with wefted silver. The warm breath of the summer night was gentle as the sighing of a woman in slumber.\n\n'Must you go, after all?' said Moriamis, in a pleading and regretful voice.\n\n'It is my duty. I must return to Clément with the Book of Eibon and the other evidence I have collected against Azédarac.' The words sounded a little unreal to Ambrose as he uttered them; and he tried very hard, but vainly, to convince himself of the cogency and validity of his arguments. The idyll of his stay with Moriamis, to which he was oddly unable to attach any true conviction of sin, had given to all that preceded it a certain dismal insubstantiality. Free of all responsibility or restraint, in the sheer obliviousness of dreams, he had lived like a happy pagan; and now he must go back to the drear existence of a nediaeval monk, beneath the prompting of an obscure sense of duty.\n\n'I shall not try to hold you,' Moriamis sighed. 'But I shall miss you, and remenber you as a worthy lover and a pleasant playmate. Here is the philtre.' The green essence was cold and almost hueless in the moonlight, as Moriamis poured it into a little cup and gave it to Ambrose.\n\n'Are you sure of its precise efficacy?' the monk inquired. 'Are you sure that I shaH return to the Inn of Bonne Jouissance, at a time not far subsequent to that of my departure therefrom?'\n\n'Yea,' said Moriamis, 'for the potion is infallible. But stay, I have also brought along the other vial — the vial of the past. Take it with you — for who knows, you may sometime wish to return and visit me again.'\n\nAmbrose accepted the red vial and placed it in his robe beside the ancient manual of Hyperborean sorcery. Then, after an appropriate farewell to Moriamis, he drained with sudden resolution the contents of the cup.\n\nThe moonlit glade, the gray altar, and Moriamis, all vanished in a swirl of flame and shadow. It seemed to Ambrose that he was soaring endlessly through fantasmagoric gulfs, amid the ceaseless shifting and melting of unstable things, the transient forming and fading of irresoluble worlds. At the end, he found himself sitting once more in the Inn of Bonne Jouissance. at what he assumed to be the very same table before which he had sat with the Sieur des Émaux. It was daylight, and the room was full of people, among whom he looked in vain for the rubicund face of the innkeeper, or the servants and fellow-guests he had previously seen. All were unfamiliar to him; and the furniture was strangely worn, and was grimier than he remembered it.\n\nPerceiving the presence of Ambrose, the people began to eye him with open curiosity and wonderment. A tall man with dolorous eyes and lantern jaws came hastily forward and bowed before him with an air that was half servile but full of a prying impertinence.\n\n'What do you wish?' he asked.\n\n'Is this the Inn of Bonne Jouissance?'\n\nThe innkeeper stared at Ambrose. 'Nay, it is the Inn of Haute Esperance, of which I have been the taverner these thirty years. Could you not read the sign? It was called the Inn of Bonne Jouissance in my father's time, but the name was changed after his death.'\n\nAmbrose was filled with consternation. 'But the inn was differently named, and was kept by another man when I visited it not long ago,' he cried in bewilderment. 'The owner was a stout, jovial man, not in the least like you.'\n\n'That would answer the description of my father,' said the taverner, eyeing Ambrose more dubiously than ever. 'He has been dead for the full thirty years of which I speak; and surely you were not even born at the time of his decease.'\n\nAmbrose began to realize what had happened. The emerald potion, by some error or excess of potcncy, had taken him many years beyond his own time into the future!\n\n'I must resume my journey to Vyones,' he said in a bewildered voice, without fully comprehending the implications of his situation. 'I have a message for the Archbishop Clément — and must not delay longer in delivering it.'\n\n'But Clément has been dead even longer than my father,' exclaimed the inn-keeper. 'From whence do you come, that you are ignorant of this?' It was plain from his manner that he had begun to doubt the sanity of Ambrose. Others, overhearing the strange discussion, had begun to crowd about, and were plying the monk with jocular and sometimes ribald questions.\n\n'And what of Azédarac, the Bishop of Ximes? Is he dead, too?' inquired Ambrose, desperately. 'You mean St. Azédarac, no doubt. He outlived Clément, but nevertheless he has been dead and duly canonized for thirty-two years. Some say that he did not die, but was transported to heaven alive, and that his body was never buried in the great mausoleum reared for him at Ximes. But that is probably a mere legend.'\n\nAmbrose was overwhelmed with unspeakable desolation and confusion. In the meanwhile, the crowd about him had increased, and in spite of his robe, he was being made the subject of rude remarks and jeers.\n\n'The good Brother has lost his wits,' cried some. 'The wines of Averoigne are too strong for him,' said others. 'What year is this?' demanded Ambrose, in his desperation.\n\n'The year of our Lord, 1230,' replied the taverner, breaking into a derisive laugh. 'And what year did you think it was?'\n\n'It was the year 1175 when I last visited the Inn of Bonne Jouissance,' admitted Ambrose.\n\nHis declaration was greeted with fresh jeers and laughter. 'Hola, young sir, you were not even conceived at that time,' the taverner said. Then, seeming to remember something, he went on in a more thoughtful tone: 'When I was a child, my father told me of a young monk, about your age, who came to the Inn of Bonne Jouissance one evening in the summer of 1175, and vanished inexplicably after drinking a draft of red wine. I believe his name was Ambrose. Perhaps you are Ambrose, and have only just returned from a visit to nowhere.' He gave a derisory wink, and the new jest was taken up and bandied from mouth to mouth among the frequenters af the tavern.\n\nAmbrose was trying to realize the full import of his predicament. His mission was now useless, through the death or disappearance of Azédarac; and no one would remain in all Averoigne to recognize him or believe his story. He felt the hopelessness of his alienation among unknown years and people.\n\nSuddenly he remembered the red vial given him at parting by Moriamis. The potion, like the green philtre, might prove uncertain in its effect; but he was seized by an allconsuming desire to escape from the weird embarrassment and wilderment of his present position. Also, he longed for Moriamis like a lost child for its mother; and the charm of his sojourn in the past was upon him with an irresistible spell. Ignoring the ribald faces and voices about him, he drew the vial from his bosom, uncorked it, and swallowed the contents....\n\nV\n\nHe was back in the forest glade, by the gigantic altar. Moriamis was beside him again, lovely and warm and breathing; and the moon was still rising above the pinetops. It seemed that no more than a few moments could have elapsed since he had said farewell to the beloved enchantress. 'I thought you might return,' said Moriamis. 'And I waited a little while.'\n\nAmbrose told her of the singular mishap that had attended his journey in time.\n\nMoriamis nodded gravely. 'The green philtre was more potent than I had supposed,' she remarked. 'It is fortunate, though, that the red philtre was equivalently strong, and could bring you back to me through all those added years. You will have to remain with me now, for I possessed only the two vials. I hope you are not sorry.'\n\nAmbrose proceeded to prove, in a somewhat unmonastic manner, that her hope was fully justified.\n\nNeither then nor at any other time did Moriamis tell him that she herself had strengthened slightly and equally the two philtres by means of the private formula which she had also stolen from Azédarac.",

"\"以千母羊之公羊为誓！以达贡之尾与德塞托之角为誓！\"阿泽达拉克低语道，指尖摩挲着面前桌上那个鼓腹的朱红色小瓶，\"必须处置那个瘟神般的安布罗斯兄弟。我已查明，阿维罗尼大主教派他来希姆城，就是为了搜集我与阿撒兹勒及旧日支配者地下往来的证据。他窥探过我在密室举行的召唤仪式，窃听过隐秘咒文，目睹过莉莉丝的真身显现，甚至见过比世界更古老的恶魔约格-索托特与索达古——就在今晨，他骑着白驴启程返回维永了。\"他枯瘦的手指突然收紧，\"要避免巫术审判的麻烦，方法有两种——或者说本质上只有一种：要么在他抵达目的地前让他服下瓶中之物，要么...\"主教苍白眉弓下那双幽黑瞳孔泛起硫磺般的火光，\"我就得亲自服用类似的药剂了。\"\n\n让·莫瓦索瓦凝视着药瓶，又看向主教。这位希姆城主教方才的非神圣誓言与离经叛道的言论，既未令他惊骇，甚至未能使他挑眉。他与主教相识太久，为其处理过太多不可告人之事，早已对任何异状习以为常。事实上，早在阿泽达拉克萌生圣职野心之前，早在希姆城居民对其过往毫无猜疑的年代，让就已知晓这位巫师的真面目——而主教也从不费心对他保守秘密。\n\n\"明白。\"让说道，\"瓶中药液必将送达。安布罗斯骑着那匹慢悠悠的白驴绝难疾行，明日正午前到不了维永。我们有充足时间截住他。当然，他认得我——至少认得让·莫瓦索瓦这副面孔...\"他嘴角扯出刀锋般的弧度，\"不过这很容易解决。\"\n\n阿泽达拉克露出胜券在握的微笑：\"此事——连同药瓶——就托付与你了，让。其实即便事败，凭我掌控的恶魔之力与上古邪术，那些榆木脑袋的宗教狂也奈何不了我。\"他抚摸着绣有十字纹样的法衣前襟，\"但我在希姆城的舒适地位来之不易。既能享受基督教主教的香火供奉，又能与深渊之主暗通款曲，总比当个东躲西藏的野巫师强。只要可能，我不愿被打扰，更不想丢掉这个肥缺。\"\n\n\"愿摩洛神吞了那个假正经的安布罗斯小崽子。\"主教突然咬牙切齿，\"我真是老糊涂了，竟没早些察觉。最近他总躲闪着不敢与我对视，活像透过锁孔窥见了地下仪式。今早听闻他要离开，我特意检查了藏书室——\"他喉结滚动着咽下某种粘稠的怒意，\"果然发现《艾本之书》不见了。那本记载着最古老咒语、封印着约格-索托特与索达古秘术的典籍，我特意用基督教弥撒书的羊皮封面伪装，藏在正经祷文集中。现在这杂种正把它藏在袍子里，作为我修习黑魔法的铁证。\"指甲深深掐入掌心，\"阿维罗尼没人能读懂那些上古文字，但书页间龙血绘制的符咒插图，就足够定我死罪。\"\n\n主仆二人陷入意味深长的沉默。让注视着阿泽达拉克：主教高大身躯投下的阴影、刻满阴鸷纹路的面容、灰白渐秃的头顶、苍白前额上那道新月状红疤，以及那双仿佛燃烧着橙色火苗的漆黑眼瞳。而主教审视着让那张狡黠如狐的面孔——这张脸可以伪装成布商，必要时也能假扮神职人员。\n\n\"真遗憾，\"阿泽达拉克突然叹息，\"阿维罗尼教区竟有人质疑我的虔诚。不过迟早会有这一天——我和其他教士的区别，无非是我清醒自愿地侍奉恶魔，而他们是在神圣的愚昧中做着同样勾当...\"他忽然压低声音，\"但我们必须推迟丑闻爆发的时间。眼下只有安布罗斯能指证我，而你，让，要送他去某个...无法告密的地方。之后我会加倍谨慎。我向你保证，维永派来的下一个探子，只会发现个捻着玫瑰念珠的圣徒。\"\n\n二\n\n当安布罗斯骑着大主教赐予的乳白毛驴穿行在希姆与维永之间的阿维罗尼森林时，内心翻涌的恐惧与周遭宁静美景形成可怖反差。某种黏腻的惊骇如同毒蛇在他心脏筑巢，而藏在袍中的《艾本之书》仿佛一块烙在胸口的恶魔印记。他第一千次懊悔接受克莱芒大主教的委托——在希姆主教宅邸驻留的一个月里，他目睹的亵渎景象已化作记忆白纸上永不褪色的污痕。一位基督教主教竟暗中供奉比阿斯蒙蒂斯更古老的邪神，这发现彻底玷污了他虔诚的灵魂。自那以后，腐败气息似乎弥漫在每个角落，黑暗之敌的蛇形触须仿佛从四面八方逼近。\n\n毛驴缓步穿过幽暗松林与苍翠山毛榉时，安布罗斯渴望胯下是匹更快些的坐骑。树影间总浮现嘲弄的石像鬼面孔，无形的分趾蹄声在浓荫蜿蜒的道路上如影随形。斜阳将蛛网般的细长阴影投在林间，整座森林仿佛屏息等待着某种不可名状之物的经过。尽管一路上既无鸟兽也无行人，修士的冷汗仍浸透了粗麻僧袍。\n\n恐惧的思绪不断闪回阿泽达拉克——那个从阿巴顿火沼中崛起的巨大敌基督者。他再度看见主教宅邸下的地窖：缭绕的亵渎熏香与硫磺恶臭混合成翻滚的烟云，而烟云中舞动着庞大可憎的形体...莉莉丝前亚当时代的淫邪，索达古超越银河的恐怖，约格-索托特那突破维度限制的丑恶姿态。这些上古恶魔竟将爪牙安插在教会核心，而阿泽达拉克九年来稳坐主教之位，其罪行比异教徒更甚。直到某日，匿名渠道传来的耳语终于引起克莱芒警觉...\n\n安布罗斯突然浑身战栗：阿泽达拉克是否已发现《艾本之书》失窃？更可怕的是，那位巫师会采取什么行动？这个念头被身后骤然的马蹄声打断。林间小径转出一位骑黑马的浓须贵族，华服彰显其显赫身份。那人超越安布罗斯时礼貌颔首，很快消失在绿叶掩映的弯道。修士刚松口气，却发现太阳以反常的速度沉入地平线。无云的天空下，难以解释的幽暗从四面涌来，树干扭曲成怪异姿态，灌木丛化作不祥轮廓。寂静如同脆弱的薄膜，随时会被恶魔嘶吼刺破。\n\n当\"欢愉客栈\"的灯光穿透林雾时，安布罗斯如获救赎。他将坐骑交给马夫，走进烟雾缭绕的厅堂。老板殷勤招待这位神职人员，而修士注意到那位浓须贵族独自坐在角落。其余客人——两个布商、一位公证员和两名士兵——仅对修士点头致意，唯独贵族起身相邀：\"不愿与我共进晚餐吗，修士先生？我是图赖纳的埃莫勋爵，正前往维永大教堂。\"尽管那双细眼里闪烁的烛光令安布罗斯不安，他仍无法拒绝这看似善意的邀请。\n\n\"您是本笃会修士吧？\"埃莫勋爵端详着修士的僧袍，笑容带着隐秘的讥诮，\"我一直仰慕这个高贵的修会。敢问尊名？\"得到答复后，他击掌唤来店主：\"让我们为安布罗斯兄弟的健康干杯！赶路后饮些阿维罗尼红酒最适宜不过。\"安布罗斯勉强同意，却愈发厌恶对方——那嗓音里藏着毒蛇般的嘶嘶声，低垂的眼睑掩着恶意。更可怕的是，他忽然惊觉这张脸似曾相识...\n\n当勋爵离席去地窖选酒时，安布罗斯注意到店主对其恭敬的态度，稍感安心。但当两只陶罐与酒杯摆上桌时，修士恍惚看见其中一个杯底残留着暗红液体。\"这两款酒难分高下，\"勋爵斟满酒杯推过来，\"但您定能品鉴出拉弗雷奈葡萄酒的玄妙——它蕴含的炽烈足以将灵魂带离尘世。\"安布罗斯举杯刹那，勋爵俯身嗅酒的姿态突然触发恐怖记忆——浓须掩盖的尖削面容，竟与阿泽达拉克的心腹让·莫瓦索瓦神似！修士双手颤抖，杯中酒液晃出猩红波纹，仿佛一条毒蛇正从杯底昂首。\n\n\"喝吧，安布罗斯兄弟。\"珐琅领主说着饮尽杯中酒，\"为您的安康，也为所有虔诚的本笃会修士干杯。\"\n\n安布罗斯迟疑着。对方那双冰冷而蛊惑的眼睛紧盯着他，尽管满心恐惧，他却无力拒绝。在某种不可抗拒的强迫感驱使下，他微微颤抖着饮尽杯中酒液，仿佛随时会因烈性毒药暴毙而亡。\n\n刹那间，他最可怕的预感应验了。酒液如冥河烈焰灼烧着他的喉咙与嘴唇，滚烫的水银似乎正注入他的血管。紧接着，一股刺骨寒意席卷全身，冰霜旋风裹挟着呼啸气流将他缠绕，座椅在身下融化，他坠入无尽的冰川深渊。酒馆墙壁如消散的雾气般飞逝，灯火宛如沼泽黑雾中的星辰相继熄灭，珐琅领主的面容在涡旋阴影中渐渐淡去，恰似子夜湍流中破裂的水泡。\n\n三\n\n安布罗斯费了些功夫才确信自己尚未死去。在永恒的坠落中，他穿越灰色夜幕，周遭变幻着模糊不定的形体，尚未凝实便已溃散成新的混沌。有片刻他以为重新触到了墙壁，下一刻又坠入幻影森林的层层台地。时而他仿佛瞥见人脸，但一切都如飘渺烟雾与翻涌暗影般虚幻难辨。\n\n毫无预兆地，坠落感突然消失。周遭朦胧的幻象凝聚成真实场景——却丝毫不见欢愉酒馆或珐琅领主的踪迹。\n\n安布罗斯难以置信地环视这超乎常理的境况。光天化日下，他正坐在一块粗凿的花岗岩方碑上。开阔的林间空地外环绕着参天古松与枝繁叶茂的山毛榉，夕阳为树梢镀上金边。而在他面前，伫立着几个陌生人。\n\n这些身披前所未见白袍的野蛮人满脸虬髯，用近乎宗教狂热的惊愕目光注视着他。他们长发如纠缠的黑蛇，眼中燃烧着癫狂的火焰，每人右手都握着粗砺的石刀。\n\n安布罗斯怀疑自己是否已堕入某个未知地狱，面对的是异教魔鬼。鉴于自身信仰与遭遇，这推测并非毫无道理。他战栗地默念祷文，祈求上帝将他从这些灵界仇敌手中解救。随后他突然想起阿泽达拉克的亡灵法术，意识到自己可能被巫师主教传送到了远古邪魔手中。确认肉身完好后，他断定自己仍存活于人世——尽管处境诡谲危险。\n\n那些生物始终沉默，直到听见安布罗斯的祈祷才突然喧哗起来。他们发出含混刺耳的音节，频繁重复着\"塔拉尼特\"这个词。当吟诵声渐成原始咒语般的节奏时，其中两人上前按住安布罗斯，其余人则发出尖锐的胜利颂唱。\n\n安布罗斯被仰面按在石台上，眼看燧石刀就要刺入心脏。千钧一发之际，一个清越女声穿透了狂乱的咒唱。尽管听不懂语言，挟持者却立即服从命令放下了石刀。\n\n救星站在古松垂荫下的空地边缘。她身着夜幕般深蓝的长袍，金褐色发辫如东方巨蟒盘绕，琥珀色眼眸与雪白肌肤在树影中格外醒目。这位仪态威严的高挑女子令安布罗斯既敬畏又惶恐，如同面对女王与魅魔的结合体。\n\n\"跟我来。\"她用安布罗斯在修道院古籍中见过的古奥弗方言说道。他顺从地跟随她步入密林小径，将白袍众人抛在身后。\n\n\"我是女巫莫瑞阿米斯。\"女子微笑道，\"德鲁伊惧怕我的魔法，尽管我只用它造福人类。\"得知救命恩人竟是女巫，修士暗自惊惶，但仍谨慎表达感激。\n\n当安布罗斯问及返回欢愉酒馆的路时，莫瑞阿米斯蹙眉表示从未听闻此地，甚至对伊姆城与维永城也一无所知。修士愈发确信自己中了阿泽达拉克的邪术。\n\n听到巫师名字时，女巫突然浑身紧绷。\"阿泽达拉克？\"她急切追问，\"可是身形高大、鬓角灰白，眉间有新月疤痕的那位？\"得到肯定答复后，她眼中闪过复杂神色。安布罗斯向她倾诉遭遇，期盼获得更多关于这位神秘主教的线索。\n\n莫瑞阿米斯聆听着，神情专注却毫不惊讶，仿佛早已预知这一切。\n\n“我现在明白了，”待他说完后，她低语道，“很快我就会为你解开所有困惑。那个让·马弗索尔——我猜就是昔日名为梅尔基尔的恶徒——多年来始终是阿泽达拉克的仆从。这两个卑劣之徒自古便侍奉着远古存在，其手段连德鲁伊们都闻所未闻。”\n\n“但愿您真能解释这一切，”安布罗斯声音发颤，“傍晚时分在酒馆啜饮葡萄酒，次日午后却置身密林深处，遭遇那般可怖的恶魔......这实在超出凡人理解。”\n\n“何止超出，”莫瑞阿米斯幽然道，“你可知自己踏入'欢愉客栈'是哪一年？”\n\n“自然是主后1175年，还能有——”\n\n“德鲁伊们使用另一套纪年法，”她打断道，“按基督教即将传入阿维罗尼的历法，此刻是公元475年。你被抛回了七百年前的过去。发现你的那座德鲁伊祭坛，未来将成为'欢愉客栈'的遗址。”\n\n安布罗斯如遭雷击。他的思维根本无法消化这番言论。\n\n“但时间逆流怎可能......”他嘶声道，“活人怎会踏入早已化为尘埃的年代？”\n\n“这恐怕要问阿泽达拉克了。”女巫的瞳孔在暮色中闪烁，“过去、现在与未来本就如同时之环的碎片共存，我们不过是从不同角度窥见罢了。”\n\n修士感到自己正坠入某种亵渎的巫术漩涡，沦为基督教典籍都未曾记载的邪法牺牲品。当所有言语都显得苍白无力时，他瞥见小径尽头浮现出座石塔，菱形窗棂在松枝掩映间若隐若现。\n\n“寒舍到了。”莫瑞阿米斯引他登上丘顶。塔内陈设虽简朴却洁净，粗木家具与厚重挂毯透着古意。一名肤色黝黑的高大女仆端来牛奶黑面包，终于缓解了修士自“欢愉客栈”便未得满足的饥渴。\n\n用餐时，安布罗斯突然想起怀中沉甸甸的《艾本之书》。他将古籍递给女巫，后者瞳孔骤缩，却待他咽下最后一口面包才开口：\n\n“这确实是阿泽达拉克的宝物。那恶棍......”她胸脯剧烈起伏，“曾是法力最强的巫师，掌握着连同行都参不透的如尼符文。他能调配令人穿越时空的魔药——红瓶溯往，绿瓶赴未来。梅尔基尔定是给你灌了红瓶，而他们主仆则用绿瓶潜入了你的时代。”\n\n她突然从壁橱取出两只细颈瓶，猩红与翠绿的液体在玻璃中诡谲流转。“当年我偷藏了这两剂。若饮下绿瓶，你就能回到......”\n\n“回到我的时代！”安布罗斯激动起来，“定会坏了阿泽达拉克的好事！”\n\n“他如今混成了主教吧？”女巫冷笑，“想到你要向大主教告发......虽然我本性不喜报复，不过......”她忽然贴近修士，发间葡萄藤花的幽香阵阵袭来，“何必急着走？在你原本的时代里，多耽搁几日又何妨？我还能调整魔药浓度......”\n\n暮色渐浓。莫瑞阿米斯解开辫子，琥珀色眼眸在昏暗中灼灼发亮。安布罗斯结结巴巴提起大主教的训诫，她却轻笑：“那位大人还要六百五十年才出生呢。况且等你回去时，在这里发生的一切都已是七百年前的往事......什么罪孽洗不清？”\n\n如同陷入瑰丽噩梦却不愿醒转，修士最终屈服于这充满女巫魅力的逻辑。在德鲁伊统治的异时空里，修道院的清规戒律似乎也变得遥远模糊。\n\n（第四部分）\n满月夜，祭坛边。银辉为林梢镀上蕾丝般的白边，夏夜暖风带着女子睡梦般的轻喘。莫瑞阿米斯与安布罗斯静立在苔藓覆盖的巨石前，魔药瓶在月光下泛着妖异的光泽。\n\n\"你终究还是要走吗？\"莫瑞阿米斯用哀婉凄楚的声调问道。\n\n\"这是我的职责。我必须带着《艾本之书》和其他指控阿泽达拉克的证据回到克莱芒身边。\"安布罗斯说出这些话时，连自己都觉得虚幻不实；他竭力说服自己这些理由足够充分，却终究徒劳无功。与莫瑞阿米斯共度的旖旎时光——奇怪的是他竟丝毫不觉有罪——使得此前的一切都蒙上了阴森缥缈的雾霭。在彻底沉溺的梦境中，他如欢愉的异教徒般无拘无束；而今却要在这晦暗责任感的驱使下，重返中世纪僧侣的枯寂生活。\n\n\"我不强留你，\"莫瑞阿米斯轻叹，\"但会怀念你这个称职的情人与有趣的玩伴。这是魔药。\"当她将碧绿药液倾入小杯递给安布罗斯时，月光下那液体泛着冷冽的惨白。\n\n\"你确定它的时效分毫不差？\"僧侣追问，\"能确保我回到美悦客栈的时间与离去时相隔无几吗？\"\n\n\"当然，\"莫瑞阿米斯答道，\"此药万无一失。且慢，我还带了另一瓶——回溯往昔之药。带上它吧，或许某天你会想再来寻我。\"\n\n安布罗斯收下绯红药瓶，与那本远古的极北巫术典籍一同藏入袍中。与莫瑞阿米斯作别后，他突然决绝地仰首饮尽杯中物。\n\n月照林间空地、灰暗祭坛与莫瑞阿米斯的身影，全在烈焰与暗影的漩涡中消散。安布罗斯感觉自己永无止境地穿梭在幻象丛生的深渊里，周遭是不断扭曲消融的虚妄之物，转瞬即逝的异界时隐时现。最终他发现自己又坐在美悦客栈里，想必正是当初与彩釉爵士对酌的那张桌前。白昼天光下，满室陌生面孔中再也寻不见店主红润的脸庞，亦无旧日仆役与同宿之客。家具莫名陈旧，积垢远甚记忆。\n\n众人察觉安布罗斯的存在后，开始明目张胆地投以好奇目光。一个眼窝深陷的马脸高个男子快步上前，半是谦卑半是冒犯地躬身发问：\"您有何贵干？\"\n\n\"这里不是美悦客栈？\"\n\n店主盯着安布罗斯：\"此乃高望客栈，我经营已三十载。您没看见招牌吗？先父在世时确叫美悦客栈，但他过世后就改名了。\"\n\n安布罗斯如遭雷击：\"可我前些日子来时分明是另一个名字，店主也非你这般模样，\"他困惑地喊道，\"那是个快活的胖老板，与你全无相似。\"\n\n\"听来正是先父，\"店主打量安布罗斯的眼神愈发狐疑，\"他去世恰满三十载，您那时怕还未出世。\"\n\n安布罗斯猛然醒悟。那翡翠魔药因剂量偏差，竟将他抛向了数十年后的未来！\n\n\"我得继续赶路去维约讷，\"他恍惚道，尚未完全理解处境，\"要给克莱芒大主教送信，不能再耽搁了。\"\n\n\"克莱芒去世比先父还早，\"店主惊呼，\"您从何处来，竟不知此事？\"其态度明显开始怀疑安布罗斯的神志。围观者渐多，纷纷用轻佻言辞调侃这位僧侣。\n\n\"那希梅斯主教阿泽达拉克呢？也死了吗？\"安布罗斯绝望地追问。\"您指的必是圣阿泽达拉克。他比克莱芒长寿，但三十二年前也已蒙主宠召。有人说他未死而是肉身升天，遗体从未葬入希梅斯那座为他修建的宏伟陵寝——不过多半是谣传。\"\n\n难以名状的孤寂与混乱淹没了安布罗斯。人群越聚越多，尽管身着僧袍，他仍成为粗鄙嘲弄的对象。\"这位兄弟失心疯了，\"有人起哄，\"阿弗罗涅的酒太烈啦，\"另一些人附和。\"今年是何年？\"安布罗斯颤声问道。\n\n\"主历1230年，\"店主发出讥笑，\"您当是哪年呢？\"\n\n\"我上次来美悦客栈是1175年。\"\n\n此言引发新一轮哄笑。\"哈！年轻人，那年月您爹娘都未必相识，\"店主突然若有所思，\"幼时听先父提过，1175年夏夜有位与您年纪相仿的年轻僧侣来店，饮罢红酒便离奇消失。记得名叫安布罗斯。莫非您就是那个从虚无之境归来的安布罗斯？\"他讥诮地眨眨眼，酒客们立刻将这新笑话传扬开来。\n\n安布罗斯试图理清自身困境的深意。随着阿泽达拉克的消亡，他的使命已成徒劳；整个阿弗罗涅再无人认得他或相信他的故事。在这陌生的年代与人群之中，他感到彻骨的疏离与绝望。\n\n突然他想起莫瑞阿米斯临别所赠的绯红药瓶。此药或如碧绿魔药般效力难测，但逃离当下荒诞处境的渴望吞噬了他。对莫瑞阿米斯的思念如迷途幼童渴慕母亲，往昔岁月的魔力不可抗拒地召唤着他。无视周遭的狎昵面孔，他掏出药瓶拔开塞子一饮而尽......\n\n五\n\n他重返林间祭坛旁。莫瑞阿米斯依旧温香软玉在侧，松梢新月仍悬。与心爱女巫的告别仿佛就在须臾之前。\"料你会回来，\"莫瑞阿米斯说，\"我便多等了片刻。\"\n\n安布罗斯向她讲述时空之旅的诡异差错。\n\n莫瑞阿米斯肃然颔首：\"碧绿魔药比我预想的更烈。所幸绯红药液效力相当，才能带你穿越这些年月回到我身边。如今你只能永远陪着我了——毕竟我只炼得这两瓶药。但愿你不后悔。\"\n\n安布罗斯随即用不甚符合戒律的方式，证明她的期待完全合理。\n\n莫瑞阿米斯始终未曾告知：她其实用从阿泽达拉克处偷学的秘方，将两瓶魔药的效力都稍稍均等地增强了些许。"

        "content": "\n\nI. The Flight of the Necromancer\n\nThe thrice-infamous nathaire, alchemist, astrologer and necromancer, with his ten devil-given pupils, had departed very suddenIy and under circumstances of strict secrecy from the town of Vyones. It was widely thought, among the people of that vicinage, that his departure had been prompted by a salutary fear of ecclesiastical thumbscrews and faggots. Other wizards, less notorious than he, had already gone to the stake during a year of unusual inquisitory zeal; and it was well-known that Nathaire had incurred the reprobation of the Church. Few, therefore, considered the reason of his going a mystery; but the means of transit which he had employed, as well as the destination of the sorcerer and his pupils, were regarded as more than problematic.\n\nA thousand dark and superstitious rumours were abroad; and passers made the sign of the Cross when they neared the tall, gloomy house which Nathaire had built in blasphemous proximity to the great cathedral and had filled with a furniture of Satanic luxury and strangeness. Two daring thieves, who had entered the mansion when the fact of its desertion became well established, reported that much of this furniture, as well as the books and other paraphernalia of Nathaire, had seemingly departed with its owner, doubtless to the same fiery bourn. This served to augment the unholy mystery: for it was patently impossible that Nathaire and his ten apprentices, with several cart-loads of household belongings, could have passed the everguarded city gates in any legitimate manner without the knowledge of the custodians.\n\nIt was said by the more devout and religious moiety that the Archfiend, with a legion of bat-winged assistants, had borne them away bodily at moonless midnight. There were clerics, and also reputable burghers, who professed to have seen the flight of man-like shapes upon the blotted stars together with others that were not men, and to have heard the wailing cries of the hell-bound crew as they passed in an evil cloud over the roofs and city walls.\n\nOthers believed that the sorcerers had transported themselves from Vyones through their own diabolic arts, and had withdrawn to some unfrequented fastness where Nathaire, who had long been in feeble health, could hope to die in such peace and serenity as might be enjoyed by one who stood between the flames of the auto-da-fé and those of Abaddon. It was thought that he had lately cast his own horoscope, for the first time in his fifty-odd years, and had read therein an impending conjunction of disastrous planets, signifying early death.\n\nOthers still, among whom were certain rival astrologers and enchanters, said that Nathaire had retired from the public view merely that he might commune without interruption with various coadjutive demons; and thus might weave, unmolested, the black spells of a supreme and lycanthropic malice. These spells, they hinted, would in due time be visited upon Vyones and perhaps upon the entire region of Averoigne; and would no doubt take the form of a fearsome pestilence, or a wholesale invultuation, or a realm-wide incursion of succubi and incubi.\n\nAmid the seething of strange rumours, many half-forgotten tales were recalled, and new legends were created overnight Much was made of the obscure nativity of Nathaire and his dubitable wanderings before he had settled, six years previous, in Vyones. People said that he was fiend-begotten, like the fabled Merlin: his father being no less a personage than Alastor, demon of revenge; and his mother a deformed and dwarfish sorceress. From the former, he had taken his spitefulness and malignity; from the latter, his squat, puny physique.\n\nHe had travelled in Orient lands, and had learned from Egyptian or Saracenic masters the unhallowed art of necromancy, in whose practice he was unrivalled. There were black whispers anent the use he had made of long-dead bodies, of fleshless bones, and the service he had wrung from buried men that the angel of doom alone could lawfully raise up. He had never been popular, though many had sought his advice and assistance in the furthering of their own more or less dubious affairs. Once, in the third year after his coming to Vyones, he had been stoned in public because of his bruited necromancies, and had been permanently lamed by a well-directed cobble. This injury, it was thought, he had never forgiven; and he was said to return the antagonism of the clergy with the hellish hatred of an Antichrist.\n\nApart from the sorcerous evils and abuses of which he was commonly suspected, he had long been looked upon as a corrupter of youth. Despite his minikin stature, his deformity and ugliness, he possessed a remarkable power, a mesmeric persuasion; and his pupils, whom he was said to have plunged into bottomless and ghoulish iniquities, were young men of the most brilliant promise. On the whole, his vanishment was regarded as a quite providential riddance.\n\nAmong the people of the city there was one man who took no part in the sombre gossip and lurid speculation. This man was Gaspard du Nord, himself a student of the proscribed sciences, who had been numbered for a year among the pupils of Nathaire but had chosen to withdraw quietly from the master's household after learning the enormities that would attend his further initiation. He had, however, taken with him much rare and peculiar knowledge, together with a certain insight into the baleful powers and night-dark motives of the necromancer.\n\nBecause of this knowledge and insight, Gaspard preferred to remain silent when he heard of Nathaire's departure. Also, he did not think it well to revive the memory of his own past pupilage. Alone with his books, in a sparsely furnished attic, he frowned above a small, oblong mirror, framed with an arabesque of golden vipers, that had once been the property of Nathaire.\n\nIt was not the reflection of his own comely and youthful though subtly lined face that caused him to frown. Indeed, the mirror was of another kind than that which reflects the features of the gazer. In its depths, for a few instants, he had beheld a strange and ominous-looking scene, whose participants were known to him but whose location he could not recognize or orientate. Before he could study it closely, the mirror had clouded as if with the rising of alchemic fumes, and he had seen no more.\n\nThis clouding, he reflected, could mean only one thing: Nathaire had known himself watched and had put forth a counterspell that rendered the clairvoyant mirror useless. It was the realization of this fact, together with the brief, sinister glimpse of Nathaire's present activities, that troubled Gaspard and caused a chill horror to mount slowly in his mind: a horror that had not yet found a palpable form or a name.\n\n2. The Gathering of the Dead\n\nThe departure of Nathaire and his pupils occurred in the late spring of 1281, during the interlunar dark. Afterwards a new moon waxed above the flowery fields and bright-leafed woods and waned in ghostly silver. With its waning, people began to talk of other magicians and fresher mysteries.\n\nThen, in the moon-deserted nights of early summer, there came a series of disappearances far more unnatural and inexplicable than that of the dwarfish, malignant sorcerer.\n\nIt was found one day, by grave-diggers who had gone early to their toil in a cemetery outside the walls of Vyones, that no less than six newly occupied graves had been opened, and the bodies, which were those of reputable citizens, removed. On closer examination, it became all too evident that this removal had not been effected by robbers. The coffins, which lay aslant or stood protruding upright from the mould, offered all the appearance of having been shattered from within as if by the use of extrahuman strength; and the fresh earth itself was upheaved, as if the dead men, in some awful, untimely resurrection, had actually dug their way to the surface.\n\nThe corpses had vanished utterly, as if hell had swallowed them; and, as far as could be learned, there were no eyewitnesses of their fate. In those devil-ridden times, only one explanation of the happening seemed credible: demons had entered the graves and had taken bodily possession of the dead, compelling them to arise and go forth.\n\nTo the dismay and horror of all Averoigne, the strange vanishment was foIlowed with appalling promptness by many others of a like sort. It seemed as if an occult, resistless summons had been laid upon the dead. Nightly, for a period of two weeks, the cemeteries of Vyones and also those of other towns, of villages and hamlets, gave up a ghastly quota of their tenants. From brazen bolted tombs, from common charnels, from shallow, unconsecrated trenches, from the marble lidded vaults of churches and cathedrals, the weird exodus went on without cessation.\n\nWorse than this, if possible, there were newly ceremented corpses that leapt from their biers or catafalques, and disregarding the horrified watchers, ran with great bounds of automatic frenzy into the night, never to be seen again by those who lamented them.\n\nIn every case, the missing bodies were those of young stalwart men who had died but recently and had met their death through violence or accident rather than wasting illness. Some were criminals who had paid the penalty of their misdeeds; others were men-at-arms or constables, slain in the execution of their duty. Knights who had died in tourney or personal combat were numbered among them; and many were the victims of the robber bands who infested Averoigne at that time. There were monks, merchants, nobles, yeomen, pages, priests; but none, in any case, who had passed the prime of life. The old and infirm, it seemed, were safe from the animating demons.\n\nThe situation was looked upon by the more superstitious as a veritable omening of the world's end. Satan was making war with his cohorts and was carrying the bodies of the holy dead into hellish captivity. The consternation increased a hundredfold when it became plain that even the most liberal sprinkling of holy water, the performance of the most awful and cogent exorcisms, failed utterly to give protection against this diabolic ravishment. The Church owned itself powerless to cope with the strange evil; and the forces of secular law could do nothing to arraign or punish the intangible agency.\n\nBecause of the universal fear that prevailed, no effort was made to follow the missing cadavers. Ghastly tales, however, were told by late wayfarers who had met certain of these liches, striding alone or in companies along the roads of Averoigne. They gave the appearance of being deaf, dumb, totally insensate, and of hurrying with horrible speed and sureness towards a remote, predestined goal. The general direction of their flight, it seemed, was eastward; but only with the cessation of the exodus, which had numbered several hundred people, did any one begin to suspect the actual destination of the dead.\n\nThis destination, it somehow became rumoured, was the ruinous castle of Ylourgne, beyond the werewolf-haunted forest, in the outlying, semi-mountainous hills of Averoigne.\n\nYlourgne, a great, craggy pile that had been built by a line of evil and marauding barons now extinct, was a place that even the goatherds preferred to shun. The wrathful spectres of its bloody lords were said to move turbulently in its crumbling halls; and its chatelaines were the Undead. No one cared to dwell in the shadow of its cliff-founded walls; and the nearest abode of living men was a small Cistercian monastery, more than a mile away on the opposite slope of the valley.\n\nThe monks of this austere brotherhood held little commerce with the world beyond the hills; and few were the visitors who sought admission at their high-perched portals. But, during that dreadful summer, following the disappearances of the dead, a weird and disquieting tale went forth from the monastery throughout Averoigne.\n\nBeginning with late spring, the Cistercian monks were compelled to take cognizance of sundry odd phenomena in the old, long-deserted ruins of Ylourgne, which were visible from their windows, They had beheld flaring lights, where lights should not have been: flames of uncanny blue and crimson that shuddered behind the broken, weed-grown embrasures or rose starwards above the jagged crenelations. Hideous noises had issued from the ruin by night together with the flames; and the monks had heard a clangour as of hellish anvils and hammers, a ringing of gigantic armour and maces, and had deemed that Ylourgne was become a mustering-ground of devils. Mephitic odours as of brimstone and burning flesh had floated across the valley; and even by day, when the noises were silent and the lights no longer flared, a thin haze of hell-blue vapour hung upon the battlements. It was plain, the monks thought, that the place had been occupied from beneath by subterrestrial beings; for no one was seen to approach it by way of the bare, open slopes and crags. Observing these signs of the Archfoe's activity in their neighbourhood, they crossed themselves with new fervour and frequency, and said their Paters and Aves more interminably than before. Their toil and austerities, also, they redoubled. Otherwise, since the old castle was a place abandoned by men, they took no heed of the supposed occupation, deeming it well to mind their own affairs unless in case of overt Satanic hostility.\n\nThey kept a careful watch; but for several weeks they saw no one who actually entered Ylourgne or emerged therefrom. Except for the nocturnal lights and noises, and the hovering vapour by day, there was no proof of tenantry either human or diabolic. Then, one morning, in the valley below the terraced gardens of the monastery, two brothers, hoeing weeds in a carrot-patch, beheld the passing of a singular train of people who came from the direction of the great forest of Averoigne and went upwards climbing the steep, chasmy slope towards Ylourgne.\n\nThese people, the monks averred, were striding along in great haste, with stiff but flying steps; and all were strangely pale of feature and were habited in the garments of the grave. The shrouds of some were torn and ragged; and all were dusty with travel or grimed with the mould of interment. The people numbered a dozen or more; and after them, at intervals, there came several stragglers, attired like the rest. With marvellous agility and speed, they mounted the hill and disappeared at length amid the lowering walls of Ylourgne.\n\nAt this time, no rumour of the ravished graves and biers had reached the Cistercians. The tale was brought to them later, after they had beheld, on many successive mornings, the passing of small or great companies of the dead towards the devil-taken castle. Hundreds of these liches, they swore, had filed by beneath the monastery; and doubtless many others had gone past unnoted in the dark. None, however, were seen to come forth from Ylourgne, which had swallowed them up like the undisgorging Pit.\n\nThough direly frightened and sorely scandalized, the brothers still thought it well to refrain from action. Some, the hardiest, irked by all these flagrant signs of evil, had desired to visit the ruins with holy water and lifted crucifixes, But their abbot, in his wisdom, enjoined them to wait. In the meanwhile, the nocturnal flames grew brighter, the noises louder.\n\nAlso, in the course of this waiting, while incessant prayers went up from the little monastery, a frightful thing occurred. One of the brothers, a stout fellow named Theophile, in violation of the rigorous discipline, had made over-frequent visits to the wine-casks. No doubt he had tried to drown his pious horror at these untoward happenings, At any rate, after his potations, he had the ill-luck to wander out among the precipices and break his neck.\n\nSorrowing for his death and dereliction, the brothers laid Theophile in the chapel and chanted their masses for his soul. These masses, in the dark hours before morning, were interrupted by the untimely resurrection of the dead monk, who, with his head lolling horribly on his broken neck, rushed as if fiend-ridden from the chapel and ran down the hill towards the demon flames and clamours of Ylourgne.\n\n3. The Testimony of the Monks\n\nFollowing the above-related occurrence, two of the brothers who had previously desired to visit the haunted castle again applied to the abbot for this permission, saying that God would surely aid them in avenging the abduction of Theophile's body as well as the taking of many others from consecrated ground. Marvelling at the hardihood of these lusty monks, who preposed to beard the Arch-enemy in his lair, the abbot permitted them to go forth, furnished with aspergilluses and flasks of holy water, and bearing great crosses of hornbeam, such as would have served for maces with which to brain an armoured knight.\n\nThe monks, whose names were Bernard and Stephane, went boldly up at middle forenoon to assail the evil stronghold. It was an arduous climb, among overhanging boulders and along slippery scarps; but both were stout and agile, and, moreover, well accustomed to such climbing. Since the day was sultry and airless, their white robes were soon stained with sweat; but pausing only for brief prayer, they pressed on; and in good season they neared the castle, upon whose grey, time-eroded ramparts they could still descry no evidence of occupation or activity.\n\nThe deep moat that had once surrounded the place was now dry, and had been partly filled by crumbling earth and detritus from the walls. The drawbridge had rotted away; but the blocks of the barbican, collapsing into the moat, had made a sort of rough causey on which it was possible to cross. Not without trepidation, and lifting their crucifixes as warriors lift their weapons in the escalade of an armed fortress, the brothers climbed over the ruin of the barbican into the courtyard.\n\nThis too, like the battlements, was seemingly deserted. Overgrown nettles, rank grasses and sapling trees were rooted between its paving-stones. The high, massive donjon, the chapel, and that portion of the castellated structure containing the great hall, had preserved their main outlines after centuries of dilapidation. To the left of the broad bailey, a doorway yawned like the mouth of a dark cavern in the cliffy mass of the hall-building; and from this doorway there issued a thin, bluish vapour, writhing in phantom coils towards the unclouded heavens.\n\nApproaching the doorway, the brothers beheld a gleaming of red fires within, like the eyes of dragons blinking through infernal murk. They felt sure that the place was an outpost of Erebus, an ante-chamber of the Pit; but nevertheless, they entered bravely, chanting loud exorcisms and brandishing their mighty crosses of hornbeam.\n\nPassing through the cavernous doorway, they could see but indistinctly in the gloom, being somewhat blinded by the summer sunlight they had left. Then, with the gradual clearing of their vision, a monstrous scene was limned before them, with evergrowing details of crowding horror and grotesquery. Some of the details were obscure and mysteriously terrifying; others, all too plain, were branded as if with sudden, ineffaceable hell-fire on the minds of the monks.\n\nThey stood on the threshold of a colossal chamber, which seemed to have been made by the tearing down of upper floors and inner partitions adjacent to the castle hall, itself a room of huge extent. The chamber seemed to recede through interminable shadow, shafted with sunlight falling through the rents of ruin: sunlight that was powerless to dissipate the infernal gloom and mystery.\n\nThe monks averred later that they saw many people moving about the place, together with sundry demons, some of whom were shadowy and gigantic, and others barely to be distinguished from the men. These people, as well as their familiars, were occupied with the tending of reverberatory furnaces and immense pear-shaped and gourd-shaped vessels such as were used in alchemy. Some, also, were stooping above great fuming cauldrons, like sorcerers, busy with the brewing of terrible drugs. Against the opposite wall, there were two enormous vats, built of stone and mortar, whose circular sides rose higher than a man's head, so that Bernard and Stephane were unable to determine their contents. One of the vats gave forth a whitish glimmering; the other, a ruddy luminosity.\n\nNear the vats, and somewhat between them, there stood a sort of low couch or litter, made of luxurious, weirdly figured fabrics such as the Saracens weave. On this the monks discerned a dwarfish being, pale and wizened, with eyes of chill flame that shone like evil beryls through the dusk. The dwarf, who had all the air of a feeble moribund, was supervising the toils of the men and their familiars.\n\nThe dazed eyes of the brothers began to comprehend other details. They saw that several corpses, among which they recognized that of Theophile, were lying on the middle floor, together with a heap of human bones that had been wrenched asunder at the joints, and great lumps of flesh piled like the carvings of butchers. One of the men was lifting the bones and dropping them into a cauldron beneath which there glowed a rubycoloured fire; and another was flinging the lumps of flesh into a tub filled with some hueless liquid that gave forth an evil hissing as of a thousand serpents.\n\nOthers had stripped the grave-clothes from one of the cadavers, and were starting to assail it with long knives. Others still were mounting rude flights of stone stairs along the walls of the immense vats, carrying vessels filled with semi-liquescent matters which they emptied over the high rims.\n\nAppalled at this vision of human and Satanic turpitude, and feeling a more than righteous indignation, the monks resumed their chanting of sonorous exorcisms and rushed forward. Their entrance, it appeared, was not perceived by the heinously occupied crew of sorcerers and devils.\n\nBernard and Stephane, filled with an ardour of godly wrath, were about to fling themselves upon the butchers who had started to assail the dead body. This corpse they recognized as being that of a notorious outlaw, named Jacques Le Loupgarou, who had been slain a few days previous in combat with the officers of the state. Le Loupgarou, noted for his brawn, his cunning and his ferocity, had long terrorized the woods and highways of Averoigne. His great body had been half eviscerated by the swords of the constabulary; and his beard was stiff and purple with the dried blood of a ghastly wound that had cloven his face from temple to mouth. He had died unshriven, but nevertheless, the monks were unwilling to see his helpless cadaver put to some unhallowed use beyond the surmise of Christians.\n\nThe pale, malignant-looking dwarf had now perceived the brothers. They heard him cry out in a shrill, imperatory tone that rose above the ominous hiss of the cauldrons and the hoarse mutter of men and demons.\n\nThey knew not his words, which were those of some outlandish tongue and sounded like an incantation. Instantly, as if in response to an order, two of the men turned from their unholy chemistry, and lifting copper basins filled with an unknown, fetid liquor, hurled the contents of these vessels in the faces of Bernard and Stephane.\n\nThe brothers were blinded by the stinging fluid, which bit their flesh as with many serpents' teeth; and they were overcome by the noxious fumes, so that their great crosses dropped from their hands and they both fell unconscious on the castle floor.\n\nRecovering anon their sight and their other senses, they found that their hands had been tied with heavy thongs of gut, so that they were now helpless and could no longer wield their crucifixes or the sprinklers of holy water which they carried.\n\nIn this ignominious condition, they heard the voice of the evil dwarf, commanding them to arise. They obeyed, though clumsily and with difficulty, being denied the assistance of their hands. Bernard, who was still sick with the poisonous vapour he had inhaled, fell twice before he succeeded in standing erect; and his discomfiture was greeted with a cachinnation of foul, obscene laughter from the assembled sorcerers.\n\nNow, standing, the monks were taunted by the dwarf, who mocked and reviled them, with appalling blasphemies such as could be uttered only by a bond-servant of Satan. At last, according to their sworn testimony, he said to them:\n\n\"Return to your kennel, ye whelps of Ialdabaoth, and take with you this message: They that came here as many shall go forth as one.\"\n\nThen, in obedience to a dreadful formula spoken by the dwarf, two of the familiars, who had the shape of enormous and shadowy beasts, approached the body of Le Loupgarou and that of Brother Theophile. One of the foul demons, like a vapour that sinks into a marsh, entered the bloody nostrils of Le Loupgarou, disappearing inch by inch, till its horned and bestial head was withdrawn from sight. The other, in like manner, went in through the nostrils of Brother Theophile, whose head lay weird athwart his shoulder on the broken neck.\n\nThen, when the demons had completed their possession, the bodies, in a fashion horrible to behold, were raised up from the castle floor, the one with ravelled entrails hanging from its wide wounds, the other with a head that dropped forward loosely on its bosom. Then, animated by their devils, the cadavers took up the crosses of hornbeam that had been dropped by Stephane and Bernard; and using the crosses for bludgeons, they drove the monks in ignominious flight from the castle, amid a loud, tempestuous howling of infernal laughter from the dwarf and his necromantic crew. And the nude corpse of Le Loupgarou and the robed cadaver of Theophile followed them far on the chasm-riven slopes below Ylourgne, striking great blows with the crosses, so that the backs of the two Cistercians were become a mass of bloody bruises.\n\nAfter a defeat so signal and crushing, no more of the monks were emboldened to go up against Ylourgne. The whole monastery, thereafter, devoted itself to triple austerities, to quadrupled prayers; and awaiting the unknown will of God, and the equally obscure machinations of the Devil, maintained a pious faith that was somewhat tempered with trepidation.\n\nIn time, through goatherds who visited the monks, the tale of Stephane and Bernard went forth throughout Averoigne, adding to the grievous alarm that had been caused by the wholesale disappearance of the dead. No one knew what was really going on in the haunted castle or what disposition had been made of the hundreds of migratory corpses; for the light thrown on their fate by the monks' story, though lurid and frightful, was all too inconclusive; and the message sent by the dwarf was somewhat cabalistic.\n\nEveryone felt, however, that some gigantic menace, some black, infernal enchantment, was being brewed within the ruinous walls. The malign, moribund dwarf was all too readily identified with the missing sorcerer, Nathaire; and his underlings, it was plain, were Nathaire's pupils.\n\n4. The Going-Forth of Gaspard du Nord\n\nAlone in his attic chamber, Gaspard du Nord, student of alchemy and sorcery and quondam pupil of Nathaire, sought repeatedly, but always in vain, to consult the viper-circled mirror. The glass remained obscure and cloudy, as with the risen fumes of Satanical alembics or baleful necromantic braziers. Haggard and weary with long nights of watching, Gaspard knew that Nathaire was even more vigilant than he.\n\nReading with anxious care the general configuration of the stars, he found the foretokening of a great evil that was to come upon Averoigne. But the nature of the evil was not clearly shown.\n\nIn the meanwhile the hideous resurrection and migration of the dead was taking place. All Averoigne shuddered at the manifold enormity. Like the timeless night of a Memphian plague, terror settled everywhere; and people spoke of each new atrocity in bated whispers, without daring to voice the execrable tale aloud. To Gaspard, as to everyone, the whispers came; and likewise, after the horror had apparently ceased in early midsummer, there came the appalling story of the Cistercian monks.\n\nNow, at last, the long-baffled watcher found an inkling of that which he sought. The hiding-place of the fugitive necromancer and his apprentices, at least, had been uncovered; and the disappearing dead were clearly traced to their bourn. But still, even for the percipient Gaspard, there remained an undeclared enigma: the exact nature of the abominable brew, the hell-dark sorcery, that Nathaire was concocting in his remote den. Gaspard felt sure of one thing only: the dying, splenetic dwarf, knowing that his allotted time was short, and hating the people of Averoigne with a bottomless rancour, would prepare an enormous and maleficent magic without parallel.\n\nEven with his knowledge of Nathaire's proclivities, and his awareness of the well-nigh inexhaustible arcanic science, the reserves of pit-deep wizardry possessed by the dwarf, he could form only vague, terrifical conjectures anent the incubated evil. But, as time went on, he felt an ever-deepening oppression, the adumbration of a monstrous menace crawling from the dark rim of the world. He could not shake off his disquietude; and finally he resolved despite the obvious perils of such an excursion, to pay a secret visit to the neightborhood of Ylourgne.\n\nGaspard, though he came of a well-to-do family, was at that time in straitened circumstances; for his devotion to a somewhat doubtful science had been disapproved by his father. His sole income was a small pittance, purveyed secretly to the youth by his mother and sister. This sufficed for his meagre food, the rent of his room, and a few books and instruments and chemicals; but it would not permit the purchase of a horse or even a humble mule for the proposed journey of more than forty miles.\n\nUndaunted, he set forth on foot, carrying only a dagger and a wallet of food. He timed his wanderings so that he would reach Ylourgne at nightfall in the rising of a full moon. Much of his journey lay through the great, lowering forest, which approached the very walls of Vyones on the eastern side and ran in a sombre arc through Averoigne to the mouth of the rocky valley below Ylourgne. After a few miles, he emerged from the mighty wood of pines and oaks and larches; and thenceforward, for the first day, followed the river Isoile thiough an open, well-peopled plain. He spent the warm summer night beneath a beech-tree, in the vicinity of a small village, not caring to sleep in the lonely woods where robbers and wolves — and creatures of a more baleful repute — were commonly supposed to dwell.\n\nAt evening of the second day, after passing through the wildest and oldest portion of the immemorial wood, he came to the steep, stony valley that led to his destination. This valley was the fountain-head of the Isoile, which had dwindled to a mere rivulet. In the brown twilight, between sunset and moonrise, he saw the lights of the Cistercian monastery; and opposite, on the piled, forbidding scarps, the grim and rugged mass of the ruinous stronghold of Ylourgne, with wan and wizard fires flickering behind its high embrasures. Apart from these fires, there was no sign of occupation; and he did not hear at any time the dismal noises reported by the monks.\n\nGaspard waited till the round moon, yellow as the eye of some immense nocturnal bird, had begun to peer above the darkling valley. Then, very cautiously, since the neighbourhood was strange to him, he started to make his way towards the sombre, brooding castle.\n\nEven for one well-used to such climbing, the escalade would have offered enough difficulty and danger by moonlight. Several times, finding himself at the bottom of a sheer cliff, he was compelled to retrace his hard-won progress; and often he was saved from falling only by stunted shrubs and briars that had taken root in the niggard soil. Breathless, with torn raiment and scored and bleeding hands, he gained at length the shoulder of the craggy height, below the walls.\n\nHere he paused to recover breath and recuperate his flagging strength. He could see from his vantage the pale reflection as of hidden flames, that beat upwards on the inner walls of the high-built donjon. He heard a low hum of confused noises, whose distance and direction were alike baffling. Sometimes they seemed to float downwards from the black battlements, sometimes to issue from subterranean depths far in the hill.\n\nApart from this remote, ambiguous hum, the night was locked in a mortal stillness. The very winds appeared to shun the vicinity of the dread castle. An unseen, clammy cloud of paralyzing evil hung removeless upon all things; and the pale, swollen moon, the patroness of witches and sorcerers, distilled her green poison above the crumbling towers in a silence older than time.\n\nGaspard felt the obscenely clinging weight of a more burdenous thing than his own fatigue when he resumed his progress towards the barbican. Invisible webs of the waiting, ever-gathering evil seemed to impede him. The slow, noisome flapping of intangible wings was heavy in his face. He seemed to breathe a surging wind from unfathomable vaults and caverns of corruption. Inaudible howlings, derisive or minatory, thronged in his ears, and foul hands appeared to thrust him back. But, bowing his head as if against a blowing gale, he went on and climbed the mounded ruin of the barbican, into the weedy courtyard.\n\nThe place was deserted, to all seeming; and much of it was still deep in the shadows of the walls and turrets. Near by, in the black, silver-crenellated pile, Gaspard saw the open, cavernous doorway described by the monks. It was lit from within by a lurid glare, wannish and eerie as marsh-fires. The humming noise, now audible as a muttering of voices, issued from the doorway; and Gaspard thought that he could see dark, sooty figures moving rapidly in the lit interior.\n\nKeeping in the farther shadows, he stole along the courtyard, making a sort of circuit amid the ruins. He did not dare to approach the open entrance for fear of being seen; though, as far as he could tell, the place was unguarded.\n\nHe came to the donjon, on whose upper wall the wan light flickered obliquely through a sort of rift in the long building adjacent. This opening was at some distance from the ground; and Gaspard saw that it had been formerly the door to a stony balcony. A flight of broken steps led upwards along the wall to the half-crumbled remnant of this balcony; and it occurred to the youth that he might climb the steps and peer unobserved into the interior of Ylourgne.\n\nSome of the stairs were missing; and all were in heavy shadow. Gaspard found his way precariously to the balcony, pausing once in considerable alarm when a fragment of the worn stone, loosened by his footfall, dropped with a loud clattering on the courtyard flags below. Apparently it was unheard by the occupants of the castle; and after a little he resumed his climbing.\n\nCautiously he neared the large, ragged opening through which the light poured upwards. Crouching on a narrow ledge, which was all that remained of the balcony, he peered in on a most astounding and terrific spectacle, whose details were so bewildering that he could barely comprehend their import till after many minutes.\n\nIt was plain that the story told by the monks — allowing for their religious bias — had been far from extravagant. Almost the whole interior of the half-ruined pile had been torn down and dismantled to afford room for the activities of Nathaire. This demolition in itself was a superhuman task for whose execution the sorcerer must have employed a legion of familiars as well as his ten pupils.\n\nThe vast chamber was fitfully illumed by the glare of athanors and braziers; and, above all, by the weird glimmering from the huge stone vats. Even from his high vantage, the watcher could not see the contents of these vats; but a white luminosity poured, upwards from the rim of one of them, and a flesh-tinted phosphorescence from the other.\n\nGaspard had seen certain of the experiments and evocations of Nathaire, and was all too familiar with the appurtenances of the dark arts. Within certain limits, he was not squeamish; nor was it likely that he would have been terrified overmuch by the shadowy, uncouth shapes of demons who toiled in the pit below him side by side with the blackclad pupils of the sorcerer. But a cold horror clutched his heart when he saw the incredible, enormous thing that occupied the central floor: the colossal human skeleton a hundred feet in length, stretching for more than the extent of the old castle hall; the skeleton whose bony right foot the group of men and devils, to all appearance, were busily clothing with human flesh!\n\nThe prodigious and macabre framework, complete in every part, with ribs like arches of some Satanic nave, shone as if it were still heated by the fires of an infernal welding. It seemed to shimmer and burn with unnatural life, to quiver with malign disquietude in the flickering glare and gloom. The great fingerbones, curving claw-like on the floor, appeared as if they were about to close upon some helpless prey. The tremendous teeth were set in an everlasting grin of sardonic cruelty and malice. The hollow eye-sockets, deep as Tartarean wells, appeared to seethe with myriad, mocking lights, like the eyes of elementals swimming upwards in obscene shadow.\n\nGaspard was stunned by the shocking and stupendous fantasmagoria that yawned before him like a peopled hell. Afterwards he was never wholly sure of certain things, and could remember very little of the actual manner in which the work of the men and their assistants was being carried on. Dim, dubious, bat-like creatures seemed to be flitting to and fro between one of the stone vats and the group that toiled like sculptors, clothing the bony foot with a reddish plasm which they applied and moulded like so much clay. Gaspard thought, but was not certain later, that this plasm, which gleamed as if with mingled blood and fire, was being brought from the rosy-litten vat in vessels borne by the claws of the shadowy flying creatures. None of them, however, approached the other vat, whose wannish light was momently enfeebled, as if it were dying down.\n\nHe looked for the minikin figure of Nathaire, whom he could not distinguish in the crowded scene. The sick necromancer — if he had not already succumbed to the little-known disease that had long wasted him like an inward flame — was no doubt hidden from view by the colossal skeleton and was perhaps directing the labours of the men and demons from his couch.\n\nSpellbound on that precarious ledge, the watcher failed to hear the furtive, cat-like feet that were climbing behind him on the ruinous stairs. Too late, he heard the clink of a loose fragment close upon his heels; and turning in startlement, he toppled into sheer oblivion beneath the impact of a cudgel-like blow, and did not even know that the beginning fall of his body towards the courtyard had been arrested by his assailant's arms.\n\n5. The Horror of Ylourgne\n\nGaspard, returning from his dark plunge into Lethean emptiness, found himself gazing into the eyes of Nathaire: those eyes of liquid night and ebony, in which swam the chill, malignant fires of stars that had gone down to irremeable perdition. For some time, in the confusion of his senses, he could see nothing but the eyes, which seemed to have drawn him forth like baleful magnets from his swoon. Apparently disembodied, or set in a face too vast for human cognizance, they burned before him in chaotic murk; Then, by degrees, he saw the other features of the sorcerer, and the details of a lurid scene; and became aware of his own situation.\n\nTrying to lift his hands to his aching head, he found that they were bound tightly together at the wrists. He was half lying, half leaning against an object with hard planes and edges that irked his back. This object he discovered to be a sort of alchemic furnace, or athanor, part of a litter of disused apparatus that stood or lay on the castle floor. Cupels, aludels, cucurbits, like enormous gourds and globes, were mingled in strange confusion with the piled, iron-clasped books and the sooty cauldrons and braziers of a darker science.\n\nNathaire, propped among Saracenic cushions with arabesques of sullen gold and fulgurant scarlet, was peering upon him from a kind of improvised-couch, made with bales of Orient rugs and arrases, to whose luxury the rude walls of the castle, stained with mould and mottled with dead fungi, offered a grotesque foil. Dim lights and evilly swooping shadows flickered across the scene; and Gaspard could hear a guttural hum of voices behind him. Twisting his head a little, he saw one of the stone vats, whose rosy luminosity was blurred and blotted by vampire wings that went to and fro.\n\n\"Welcome,\" said Nathaire, after an interval in which the student began to perceive the fatal progress of illness in the painpinched features before him. \"So Gaspard du Nord has come to see his former master!\" The harsh, imperatory voice, with demoniac volume, issued appallingly from the wizened frame.\n\n\"I have come,\" said Gaspard, in laconic echo. \"Tell me, what devil's work is this in which I find you engaged? And what have you done with the dead bodies that were stolen by your accursed familiars?\"\n\nThe frail, dying body of Nathaire, as if possessed by some sardonic fiend, rocked to and fro on the luxurious couch in a long, violent gust of laughter, without other reply.\n\n\"If your looks bear creditable witness,\" said Gaspard, when the baleful laughter had ceased, \"you are mortally ill, and the time is short in which you can hope to atone for your deeds of malice and make your peace with God — if indeed it still be possible for you to make peace. What foul and monstrous brew are you preparing, to ensure the ultimate perdition of your soul?\"\n\nThe dwarf was again seized by a spasm of diabolic mirth.\n\n\"Nay, nay, my good Gaspard,\" he said finally. \"I have made another bond than the one with which puling cowards try to purchase the good will and forgiveness of the heavenly Tyrant. Hell may take me in the end, if it will; but Hell has paid, and will still pay, an ample and goodly price. I must die soon, it is true, for my doom is written in the stars: but in death, by the grace of Satan, I live again, and shall go forth endowed with the mighty thews of the Anakim, to visit vengeance on the people of Averoigne, who have long hated me for my necromantic wisdom and have held me in derision for my dwarf stature.\"\n\n\"What madness is this whereof you dream?\" asked the youth, appalled by the more than human frenzy and malignity that seemed to dilate the shrunken frame of Nathaire and stream in Tartarean lustre from his eyes.\n\n\"It is no madness, but a veritable thing: a miracle, mayhap, as life itself is a miracle.... From the fresh bodies of the dead, which otherwise would have rotted away in charnel foulness, my pupils and familiars are making for me, beneath my instruction, the giant form whose skeleton you have beheld. My soul, at the death of its present body, will pass into this colossal tenement through the working of certain spells of transmigration in which my faithful assistants have also been carefully instructed.\"\n\n\"If you had remained with me, Gaspard, and had not drawn back in your petty, pious squeamishness from the marvels and profundities that I should have unveiled for you, it would now be your privilege to share in the creation of this prodigy.... And if you had come to Ylourgne a little sooner in your presumptuous prying, I might have made a certain use of your stout bones and muscles... the same use I have made of other young men, who died through accident or violence. But it is too late even for this, since the building of the bones has been completed, and it remains only to invest them with human flesh. My good Gaspard, there is nothing whatever to be done with you — except to put you safely out of the way. Providentially, for this purpose, there is an oubliette beneath the castle: a somewhat dismal lodging-place, no doubt, but one that was made strong and deep by the grim lords of Ylourgne.\"\n\nGaspard was unable to frame any reply to this sinister and extraordinary speech. Searching his horror-frozen brain for words, he felt himself seized from behind by the hands of unseen beings who had come, no doubt, in answer to some gesture of Nathaire: a gesture which the captive had not perceived. He was blindfolded with some heavy fabric, mouldy and musty as a gravecloth, and was led stumbling through the litter of strange apparatus, and down a winding flight of ruinous, narrow stairs from which the noisome breath of stagnating water, mingled with the oily muskiness of serpents, arose to meet him.\n\nHe appeared to descend for a distance that would admit of no return. Slowly the stench grew stronger, more insupportable; the stairs ended; a door clanged sullenly on rusty hinges; and Gaspard was thrust forward on a damp, uneven floor that seemed to have been worn away by myriad feet.\n\nHe heard the grating of a ponderous slab of stone. His wrists were untied, the bandage was removed from his eyes, and he saw by the light of flickering torches a round hole that yawned in the oozing floor at his feet. Beside it was the lifted slab that had formed its lid. Before he could turn to see the faces of his captors, to learn if they were men or devils, he was seized rudely and thrust into the gaping hole, He fell through Erebus-like darkness, for what seemed an immense distance, before he struck bottom. Lying half stunned in a shallow, fetid pool, he heard the funereal thud of the heavy slab as it slid back into place far above him.\n\n6. The Vaults of Ylourgne\n\nGaspard was revived, after a while, by the chillness of the water in which he lay. His garments were half soaked; and the slimy mephitic pool, as he discovered by his first movement, was within an inch of his mouth. He could hear a steady, monotonous dripping somewhere in the rayless night of his dungeon. He staggered to his feet, finding that his bones were still intact, and began a cautious exploration, Foul drops fell upon his hair and lifted face as he moved; his feet slipped and splashed in the rotten water; there were angry, vehement hissings, and serpentine coils slithered coldly across his ankles.\n\nHe soon came to a rough wall of stone, and following the wall with his finger-tips, he tried to determine the extent of the oubliette. The place was more or less circular, without corners, and he failed to form any just idea of its circuit. Somewhere in his wanderings, he found a shelving pile of rubble that rose above the water against the wall; and here, for the sake of comparative dryness and comfort, he ensconced himself, after dispossessimg a number of outraged reptiles. These creatures, it seemed, were inoffensive, and probably belonged to some species of watersnake; but he shivered at the touch of their clammy scales.\n\nSitting on the rubble-heap, Gaspard reviewed in his mind the various horrors of a situation that was infinitely dismal and desperate. He had learned the incredible, soul-shaking secret of Ylourgne, the unimaginably monstrous and blasphemous project of Nathaire; but now, immured in this noisome hole as in a subterranean tomb, in depths beneath the devil-haunted pile, he could not even warn the world of imminent menace.\n\nThe wallet of food, now more than half empty, with which he had started from Vyones, was still hanging at his back; and he assured himself by investigation that his captors had not troubled to deprive him of his dagger. Gnawing a crust of stale bread in the darkness, and caressing with his hand the hilt of the precious weapon, he sought for some rift in the all-environing despair.\n\nHe had no means of measuring the black hours that went over him with the slowness of a slime-clogged river, crawling in blind silence to a subterrene sea. The ceaseless drip of water, probably from sunken hill-springs that had supplied the castle in former years alone broke the stillness; but the sound became in time an equivocal monotone that suggested to his half-delirious mind the mirthless and perpetual chuckling of unseen imps. At last, from sheer bodily exhaustion, he fell into troubled nightmare-ridden chamber.\n\nHe could not tell if it were night or noon in the world without when he awakened; for the same stagnant darkness, unrelieved by ray or glimmer, brimmed the oubliette. Shivering, he became aware of a steady draught that blew upon him: a dank, unwholesome air, like the breath of unsunned vaults that had wakened into cryptic Iife and activity during his sleep. He had not noticed the draught heretofore; and his numb brain was startled into sudden hope by the intimation which it conveyed. Obviously there was some underground rift or channel through which the air entered; and this rift might somehow prove to be a place of egress from the oubliette.\n\nGetting to his feet, he groped uncertainly forward in the direction of the draught. He stumbled over something that cracked and broke beneath his heels, and narrowly checked himself from falling on his face in tbe slimy, serpent-haunted pool. Before he could investigate the obstruction or resume his blind groping, he heard a harsh, grating noise above, and a wavering shaft of yellow light came down through the oubliette's opened mouth. Dazzled, he looked up, and saw the round hole ten or twelve feet overhead, through which a dark hand had reached down with a flaring torch. A small basket, containing a loaf of coarse bread and a bottle of wine, was being lowered at the end of a cord.\n\nGaspard took the bread and wine, and the basket was drawn up. Before the withdrawal of the torch and the re-depositing of the slab, he contrived to make a hasty survey of his dungeon. The place was roughly circular, as he had surmised, and was perhaps fifteen feet in diameter. The thing over which he had stumbled was a human skeleton, lying half on the rubble-heap, half in the filthy water. It was brown and rotten with age, and its garments had long melted away in patches of liquid mould.\n\nThe walls were guttered and runnelled by centuries of ooze and their very stone, it seemed, was rotting slowly to decay. In the opposite side, at the bottom, he saw the opening he had, suspected: a low mouth, not much bigger than a foxes' hole, into which the sluggish water fiowed. His heart sank at the sight; for, even if the water were deeper than it seemed, the hole was far too strait for the passage of a man's body. In a state of hopelessness that was like a veritable suffocation, he found his way back to the rubble-pile when the light had been withdrawn.\n\nThe loaf of bread and the bottle of wine were still in his hands. Mechanically, with dull, sodden hunger, he munched and drank. Afterwards he felt stronger; and the sour, common wine served to warm him and perhaps helped to inspire him with the idea which he presently conceived.\n\nFinishing the bottle, he found his way across the dungeon to the low, burrow-like hole. The entering air current had strengthened, and this he took for a good omen, Drawing his dagger, he started to pick with the point at the half-rotten, decomposing wall, in an effort to enlarge the opening. He was forced to kneel in noisome silt; and the writhing coils of water-snakes, hissing frightfully, crawled across his legs as he worked. Evidently the hole was their means of ingress and egress, to and from the oubliette.\n\nThe stone crumbled readily beneath his dagger, and Gaspard forgot the horror and ghastliness of his situation in the hope of escape. He had no means of knowing the thickness of the wall; or the nature and extent of the subterrenes that lay beyond; but he felt sure that there was some channel of connection with the outer air.\n\nFor hours or days, it seemed, he toiled with his dagger, digging blindly at the soft wall and removing the dèbris that splashed in the water beside him. After a while, prone on his belly, he crept into the hole he had enlarged; and burrowing like some laborious mole, he made his way onwards inch by inch.\n\nAt last, to his prodigious relief, the dagger-point went through into empty space. He broke away with his hands the thin shell of obstructing stone that remained; then, crawling on in the darkness, he found that he could stand upright on a sort of shelving floor.\n\nStraightening his cramped limbs, he moved on very cautiously. He was in a narrow vault or tunnel, whose sides he could touch simultaneously with his outstretched finger-tips. The floor was a downwards incline; and the water deepened, rising to his knees and then to his waist, Probably the place had once been used as an underground exit from the castle; and the roof, falling in, had dammed the water.\n\nMore than a little dismayed, Gaspard began to wonder if he had exchanged the foul, skeleton-haunted oubliette for something even worse. The night around and before him was still untouched by any ray, and the air-current, though strong, was laden with dankness and mouldiness as of interminable vaults.\n\nTouching the tunnel-sides at intervals as he plunged hesitantly into the deepening water, he found a sharp angle, giving upon free space at his right. The space proved to be the mouth of an intersecting passage, whose flooded bottom was at least level and went no deeper into the stagnant foulness, Exploring it, he stumbled over the beginning of a flight of upward steps. Mounting these through the shoaling water, he soon found himself on dry stone.\n\nThe stairs, narrow, broken, irregular, without landings, appeared to wind in some eternal spiral that was coiled lightlessly about the bowels of Ylourgne. They were close and stifling as a tomb, and plainly they were not the source of the air-current which Gaspard had started to follow. Whither they would lead he knew not; nor could he tell if they were the same stairs by which he had been conducted to his dungeon. But he climbed steadily, pausing only at long intervals to regain his breath as best he could in the dead, mephitis-burdened air.\n\nAt length, in the solid darkness, far above, he began to hear a mysterious, muffled sound: a dull but recurrent crash as of mighty blocks and masses of falling stone. The sound was unspeakably ominous and dismal, and it seemed to shake the unfathomable walls around Gaspard, and to thrill with a sinister vibration in the steps on which he trod,\n\nHe climbed now with redoubled caution and alertness, stopping ever and anon to listen. The recurrent crashing noise grew louder, more ominous, as if it were immediately above; and the listener crouched on the dark stairs for a time that might have been many minutes, without daring to go farther. At last, with disconcerting suddenness, the sound came to an end, leaving a strained and fearful stillness.\n\nWith many baleful conjectures, not knowing what fresh enormity he should find, Gaspard ventured to resume his climbing. Again, in the blank and solid stillness, he was met by a sound: the dim, reverberant chanting of voices, as in some Satanic mass or liturgy with dirge-like cadences that turned to intolerably soaring paeans of evil triumph. Long before he could recognize the words, he shivered at the strong, malefic throbbing of the measured rhythm, whose fall and rise appeared somehow to correspond to the heartbeats of some colossal demon.\n\nThe stairs turned, for the hundredth time in their tortuous spiral; and coming forth from that long midnight, Gaspard blinked in the wan glimmering that streamed towards him from above. The choral voices met him in a more sonorous burst of infernal sound, and he knew the words for those of a rare and potent incantation, used by sorcerers for a supremely foul, supremely maleficent purpose. Affrightedly, as he climbed the last steps, he knew the thing that was taking place amid the ruins of Ylourgne.\n\nLifting his head warily above the castle floor, he saw that the stairs ended in a far corner of the vast room in which he had beheld Nathaire's unthinkable creation. The whole extent of the internally dismantled building lay before him, filled with a weird glare in which the beams of the slightly gibbous moon were mingled with the ruddy flames of dying athanors and the coiling, multi-coloured tongues that rose from necromantic braziers.\n\nGaspard, for an instant, was puzzled by the flood of full moonlight amid the ruins. Then he saw that almost the whole inner wall of the castle, giving on the courtyard, had been removed. It was the tearing-down of the prodigious blocks, no doubt through an extrahuman labour levied by sorcery, that he had heard during his ascent from the subterrene vaults. His blood curdled, he felt an actual horripilation, as he realized the purpose for which the wall had been demolished.\n\nIt was evident that a whole day and part of another night had gone by since his immurement; for the moon rode high in the pale sapphire welkin. Bathed in its chilly glare, the huge vats no longer emitted their eerie and electric phosphorescence. The couch of Saracen fabrics, on which Gaspard had beheld the dying dwarf, was now half hidden from view by the mounting fumes of braziers and thuribles, amid which the sorcerer's ten pupils, clad in sable and scarlet, were performing their hideous and repugnant rite, with its malefically measured litany.\n\nFearfully, as one who confronts an apparition reared up from nether hell, Gaspard beheld the colossus that lay inert as if in Cyclopean sleep on the castle flags. The thing was no longer a skeleton: the limbs were rounded into bossed, enormous thews, like the limbs of Biblical giants; the flanks were like an insuperable wall; the deltoids of the mighty chest were broad as platform; the hands could have crushed the bodies of men like millstones.... But the face of the stupendous monster, seen in profile athwart the pouring moon, was the face of the Satanic dwarf, Nathaire — re-magnified a hundred times, but the same in its implacable madness and malevolence!\n\nThe vast bosom seemed to rise and fall; and during a pause of the necromantic ritual, Gaspard heard the unmistakable sound of a mighty respiration, The eye in the profile was closed; but its lid appeared to tremble like a great curtain, as if the monster were about to wake; and the outflung hand, with fingers pale and bluish as a row of corpses, twitched unquietly on the castle flags.\n\nAn insupportable terror seized the watcher; but even this terror could not induce him to return to the noisome vaults he had left. With infinite hesitation and trepidation, he stole forth from the corner, keeping in a zone of ebon shadow that flanked the castle wall.\n\nAs he went, he saw for a moment, through bellying folds of vapour, the couch on which the shrunken form of Nathaire was lying pallid and motionless. It seemed that the dwarf was dead, or had fallen into a stupor preceding death. Then the choral voices, crying their dreadful incantation, rose higher in Satanic triumph; the vapours eddied like a hell-born cloud, coiling about the sorcerers in python-shaped volumes, and hiding again the Orient couch and its corpse-like occupant.\n\nA thraldom of measureless evil oppressed the air. Gaspard felt that the awful transmigration, evoked and implored with everswelling, liturgic blasphemies, was about to take place — had perhaps already occurred. He thought that the breathing giant stirred, like one who tosses in light slumber.\n\nSoon the towering, massively recumbent hulk was interposed between Gaspard and the chanting necromancers. They had not seen him; and he now dared to run swiftly, and gained the courtyard unpursued and unchallenged. Thence, without looking back, he fled like a devil-hunted thing upon the steep and chasm-riven slopes below Ylourgne.\n\n7. The Coming of the Colossus\n\nAfter the cessation of the exodus of liches, a universal terror still prevailed; a wide-flung shadow of apprehension, infernal and funereal, lay stagnantly on Averoigne. There were strange and disastrous portents in the aspect of the skies: flame-bearded meteors had been seen to fall beyond the eastern hills; a comet far in the south had swept the stars with its luminous bosom for a few nights, and had then faded, leaving among men the prophecy of bale and pestilence to come. By day the air was oppressed and sultry, and the blue heavens were heated as if by whitish fires. Clouds of thunder, darkling and withdrawn, shook their fulgurant lances on the far horizons, like some beleaguering Titan army. A murrain, such as would come from the working of wizard spells, was abroad among the cattle. All these signs and prodigies were an added heaviness on the burdened spirits of men, who went to and fro in daily fear of the hidden preparations and machinations of hell.\n\nBut, until the actual breaking-forth of the incubated menace, there was no one, save Gaspard du Nord, who had knowledge of its veritable form. And Gaspard, fleeing headlong beneath the gibbous moon towards Vyones, and fearing to hear the tread of a colossal pursuer at any moment, had thought it more than useless to give warning in such towns and villages as lay upon his line of sight. Where, indeed — even if warned — could men hope to hide themselves from the awful thing, begotten by Hell on the ravished charnel, that would walk forth like the Anakim to visit its roaring wrath on a trampled world?\n\nSo, all that night, and throughout the day that followed, Gaspard du Nord, with the dried slime of the oubliette on his briar-shredded raiment, plunged like a madman through the towering woods that were haunted by robbers and were-wolves. The westward-falling moon flickered in his eyes betwixt the gnarled sombre boles as he ran; and the dawn overtook him with the pale shafts of its searching arrows. The noon poured over him its white sultriness, like furnace-heated metal sublimed into light; and the clotted filth that clung to his tatters was again turned into slime by his own sweat. But still he pursued his nightmare-harried way, while a vague, seemingly hopeless plan took form in his mind.\n\nIn the interim, several monks of the Cistercian brotherhood, watching the grey wall of Ylourgne at early dawn with their habitual vigilance, were the first, after Gaspard, to behold the monstrous horror created by the necromancers. Their account may have been somewhat tinged by a pious exaggeration; but they swore that the giant rose abruptly, standing more than waist-high above the ruins of the barbican, amid a sudden leaping of long-tongued fires and a swirling of pitchy fumes erupted from Malbolge. The giant's head was level with the high top of the donjon, and his right arm, out-thrust, lay like a bar of stormy cloud athwart the new-risen sun.\n\nThe monks fell grovelling to their knees, thinking that the Archfoe himself had come forth, using Ylourgne for his gateway from the Pit. Then, across the mile-wide valley, they heard a thunderous peal of demoniac laughter; and the giant, climbing over the mounded barbican at a single step, began to descend the scarped and craggy hill.\n\nWhen he drew nearer, bounding from slope to slope, his features were manifestly those of some great devil animated with ire and malice towards the sons of Adam. His hair, in matted locks, streamed behind him like a mass of black pythons; his naked skin was livid and pale and cadaverous, with the skin of the dead; but beneath it, the stupendous thews of a Titan swelled and rippled. The eyes, wide and glaring flamed like lidless cauldrons heated by the fires of the unplumbed Pit.\n\nThe rumour of his coming passed like a gale of terror through the Monastery. Many of the Brothers, deeming discretion the better part of religious fervour, hid themselves in the stone-hewn cellars and vaults. Others crouched in their cells, mumbling and shrieking incoherent pleas to all the Saints. Still others, the most courageous, repaired in a body to the chapel and knelt in solemn prayer before the wooden Christ on the great crucifix.\n\nBernard and Stephane, now somewhat recovered from their grievous beating, alone dared to watch the advance of the giant. Their horror was inexpressibly increased when they began to recognize in the colossal features a magnified likeness to the lineaments of that evil dwarf who had presided over the dark, unhallowed activities of Ylourgne; and the laughter of the colossus, as he came down the valley, was like a tempest-borne echo of the damnable cachinnation that had followed their ignominious flight from the haunted stronghold. To Bernard and Stephane, however, it seemed merely that the dwarf, who was no doubt an actual demon, had chosen to appear in his natural form.\n\nPausing in the valley-bottom, the giant stood opposite the monastery with his flame-filled eyes on a level with the window from which Bemard and Stephane were peering. He laughed again — an awful laugh, like a subterranean rurnbling — and then, stooping, he picked up a handful of boulders as if they had been pebbles, and proceeded to pelt the monastery. The boulders crashed against the walls, as if hurled from great catapults or mangonels of war; but the stout building held, though shaken grievously.\n\nThen, with both hands, the colossus tore loose an immense rock that was deeply embedded in the hillside; and lifting this rock, he flung it at the stubborn walls. The tremendous mass broke in an entire side of the chapel; and those who had gathered therein were found later, crushed into bloody pulp amid the splinters of their carven Christ.\n\nAfter that, as if disdaining to palter any further with a prey so insignificant, the colossus turned his back on the little monastery, and like some fiend-born Goliath, went roaring down the valley into Averoigne.\n\nAs he departed, Bernard and Stephane, still watching from their window, saw a thing they had not perceived heretofore: a huge basket made of planking, that hung suspended by ropes between the giant's shoulders. In the basket, ten men — the pupils and assistants of Nathaire — were being carried like so many dolls or puppets in a peddler's pack.\n\nOf the subsequent wanderings and depredations of the colossus, a hundred legends were long current throughout Averoigne: tales of an unexampled ghastliness, a wanton diabolism without parallel in all the histories of that demon-pestered land.\n\nThe goatherds of the hills below Ylourgne saw him coming, and fled with their nimble-footed flocks to the highest ridges. To these he paid little heed, merely trampling them down like beetles when they could not escape from his path. Following the hillstream that was the source of the river Isoile, he came to the verge of the great forest; and here, it is related, he tore up a towering ancient pine by the roots, and snapping off the mighty boughs with his hands, shaped it into a cudgel which he carried henceforward.\n\nWith this cudgel, heavier than a battering-ram, he pounded into shapeless ruin a wayside shrine in the outer woods. A hamlet fell in his way, and he strode through it, beating in the roofs, toppling the walls, and crushing the inhabitants beneath his feet.\n\nTo and fro in a mad frenzy of destruction, like a deathdrunken Cyclops, he wandered all that day. Even the fierce beasts of the woodland ran from him in fear. The wolves, in mid-hunt, abandoned their quarry and retired, howling dismally with terror, to their rocky dens. The black, savage hunting-dogs of the forest barons would not face him, and hid whimpering in their kennels.\n\nMen heard his mighty laughter, his stormy bellowing; they saw his approach from a distance of many leagues, and fled or concealed themselves as best they could. The lords of moated castles called in their men-at-arms, drew up their drawbridges and prepared as if for the siege of an army. The peasants hid themselves in caverns, in cellars, in old wells, and even beneath hay-mounds, hoping that he would pass them by unnoticed. The churches were crammed with refugees who sought protection of the Cross, deeming that Satan himself, or one of his chief lieutenants, had risen to harry and lay waste the land.\n\nIn a voice like summer thunder, mad maledictions, unthinkable obscenities and blasphemies were uttered ceaselessly by the giant as he went to and fro. Men heard him address the litter of black-clad figures that he carried on his back, in tones of admonishment or demonstration such as a master would use to his pupils. People who had known Nathaire recognized the incredible likeness of the huge features, the similarity of the swollen voice to his. A rumour went abroad that the dwarf sorcerer, through his loathly bond with the Adversary, had been permitted to transfer his hateful soul into this Titanic form; and, bearing his pupils with him, had returned to vent an insatiable ire, a bottomless rancour, on the world that had mocked him for his puny physique and reviled him for his sorcery. The charnel genesis of the monstrous avatar was also rumoured; and, indeed it was said that the colossus had openly proclaimed his identity.\n\nIt would be tedious to make explicit mention of all the enormities, all the atrocities, that were ascribed to the marauding giant.... There were people — mostly priests and women, it is told — whom he picked up as they fled, and pulled limb from limb as a child might quarter an insect.... And there were worse things, not to be named in this record....\n\nMany eye-witnesses told how he hunted Pierre, the Lord of La Frênaie, who had gone forth with his dogs and men to chase a noble stag in the nearby forest Overtaking horse and rider, he caught them with one hand, and bearing them aloft as he strode over the tree-tops, he hurled them later against the granite walls of the Chateau of La Frênaie in passing. Then, catching the red stag that Pierre had hunted, he flung it after them; and the huge bloody blotches made by the impact of the bashed bodies remained long on the castle stone, and were never wholly washed away by the autumn rains and the winter snows.\n\nCountless tales were told, also, of the deeds of obscene sacrilege and profanation committed by the colossus: of the wooden Virgin that he flung into the Isoile above Ximes, lashed with human gut to the rotting, mail-clad body of an infamous outlaw; of the wormy corpses that he dug with his hands from unconsecrated graves and hurled into the courtyard of the Benedictine abbey of Perigon; of the Church of Ste. Zenobie, which he buried with its priests and congregation beneath a mountain of ordure made by the gathering of all the dungheaps from neighbouring farms.\n\n8. The Laying of the Colossus\n\nBack and forth, in an irregular, drunken, zigzag course, from end to end and side to side of the harried realm, the giant strode without pause, like an energumen possessed by some implacable fiend of mischief and murder, leaving behind him, as a reaper leaves his swath, an ever-lengthening zone of havoc, of rapine and carnage. And when the sun, blackened by the smoke of burning villages, had set luridly beyond the forest, men still saw him moving in the dusk, and heard still the portentous rumbling of his mad, stormy cachinnation.\n\nNearing the gates of Vyones at sunset, Gaspard du Nord saw behind him, through gaps in the ancient wood, the far-off head and shoulders of the terrible colossus, who moved along the Isoile, stooping from sight at intervals in some horrid deed.\n\nThough numb with weariness and exhaustion, Gaspard quickened his flight. He did not believe, however, that the monster would try to invade Vyones, the especial object of Nathaire's hatred and malice, before the following day. The evil soul of the sorcerous dwarf, exulting in its almost infinite capacity for harm and destruction, would defer the crowning act of vengeance, and would continue to terrorize, during the night, the outlying villages and rural districts.\n\nIn spite of his rags and filth, which rendered him practically unrecognizable and gave him a most disreputable air, Gaspard was admitted without question by the guards at the city gate. Vyones was already thronged with people who had fled to the sanctuary of its stout walls from the adjacent countryside; and no one, not even of the most dubious character, was denied admittance. The walls were lined with archers and pike-bearers, gathered in readiness to dispute the entrance of the giant. Crossbowmen were stationed above the gates, and mangonels were mounted at short intervals along the entire circuit of the ramparts. The city seethed and hummed like an agitated hive.\n\nHysteria and pandemonium prevailed in the streets. Pale, panic-stricken faces milled everywhere in an aimless stream. Hurrying torches flared dolorously in the twilight that deepened as if with the shadow of impending wings arisen from Erebus. The gloom was clogged with intangible fear, with webs of stifling oppression. Through all this rout of wild disorder and frenzy, Gaspard, like a spent but indomitable swimmer breasting some tide of eternal, viscid nightmare, made his way slowly to his attic lodgings.\n\nAfterwards, he could scarcely remember eating and drinking. Overworn beyond the limit of bodily and spiritual endurance, he threw himself down on his pallet without removing his ooze-stiffened tatters, and slept soddenly till an hour half-way between midnight and dawn.\n\nHe awoke with the death-pale beams of the gibbous moon shining upon him through his window; and rising, spent the balance of the night in making certain occult preparations which, he felt, offered the only possibility of coping with the fiendish monster that had been created and animated by Nathaire.\n\nWorking feverishly by the light of the westering moon and a single dim taper, Gaspard assembled various ingredients of familiar alchemic use which he possessed, and compounded from these, through a long and somewhat cabalistic process, a dark-grey powder which he had seen employed by Nathaire on numerous occasions. He had reasoned that the colossus, being formed from the bones and flesh of dead men unlawfully raised up, and energized only by the soul of a dead sorcerer, would be subject to the influence of this powder, which Nathaire had used for the laying of resurrected liches. The powder, if cast in the nostrils of such cadavers, would cause them to, return peacefully to their tombs and lie down in a renewed slumber of death.\n\nGaspard made a considerable quantity of the mixture, arguing that no mere finger-pinch would suffice for the lulling of the gigantic charnel monstrosity. His guttering yellow candle was dimmed by the white dawn as he ended the Latin formula of fearsome verbal invocation from which the compound would derive much of its efficacy. The formula, which called for the cooperation of Alastor and other evil spirits, he used with unwillingness. But he knew that there was no alternative: sorcery could be fought only with sorcery.\n\nMorning came with new terrors to Vyones. Gaspard had felt, through a sort of intuition, that the vengeful colossus, who was said to have wandered with unhuman tirelessness and diabolic energy all night through Averoigne, would approach the hated city early in the day. His intuition was confirmed; for scarcely had he finished his occult labours when he heard a mounting hubbub in the streets, and above the shrill, dismal clamour of frightened voices, the far-off roaring of the giant.\n\nGaspard knew that he must lose no time, if he were to post himself in a place of vantage from which he could throw his powder into the nostrils of the hundred-foot colossus. The city walls and even most of the church spires, were not lofty enough for this purpose; and a brief reflection told him that the great cathedral, standing at the core of Vyones, was the one place from whose roof he could front the invader with success. He felt sure that the men-at-arms on the walls could do little to prevent the monster from entering and wreaking his malevolent will. No earthly weapon could injure a being of such bulk and nature; for even a cadaver of normal size, reared up in this fashion, could be shot full of arrows or transfixed by a dozen pikes without retarding its progress.\n\nHastily he filled a huge leathern pouch with the powder; and carrying the pouch at his belt, he joined the agitated press of pople in the street. Many were fleeing towards the cathedral, to seek the shelter of its august sanctity; and he had only to let himself be borne along by the frenzy-driven stream.\n\nThe cathedral nave was packed with worshippers, and solemn masses were being said by priests whose voices faltered at times with inward panic. Unheeded by the wan, despairing throng, Gaspard found a flight of coiling stairs that led tortuously to the gargoyle-warded roof of the high tower.\n\nHere he posted himself, crouching behind the stone figure of a cat-headed griffin. From his vantage he could see, beyond the crowded spires and gables, the approaching giant, whose head and torso loomed above the city walls. A cloud of arrows, visible even at that distance, rose to meet the monster, who apparently did not even pause to pluck them from his hide. Great boulders hurled from mangonels were no more to him than a pelting of gravel; the heavy bolts of arbalests, embedded in his flesh, were mere slivers.\n\nNothing could stay his advance. The tiny figures of a company of pikemen, who opposed him with out-thrust weapons, swept from the wall above the eastern gate by a single sidelong blow of the seventy-foot pine that he bore for a cudgel. Then, having cleared the wall, the colossus climbed over it into Vyones.\n\nRoaring, chuckling, laughing like a maniacal Cyclops, he strode along the narrow streets between houses that rose only to his waist, trampling without mercy everyone who could not escape in time, and smashing in the roofs with stupendous blows of his bludgeon. With a push of his left hand he broke off the protruding gables, and overturned the church steeples with their bells clanging in dolorous alarm as they went down. A woeful shrieking and wailing of hysteria-laden voices accompanied his passing.\n\nStraight towards the cathedral he came, as Gaspard had calculated, feeling that the high edifice would be made the special butt of his malevolence.\n\nThe streets were now emptied of people; but, as if to hunt them out and crush them in their hiding-places, the giant thrust his cudgel like a battering-ram through walls and windows and roofs as he went by. The ruin and havoc that he left was indescribable.\n\nSoon he loomed opposite the cathedral tower on which Gaspard waited behind the gargoyle. His head was level with the tower, and his eyes flamed like wells of burning brimstone as he drew near. His lips were parted over stalactitic fangs in a hateful snarl; and he cried out in a voice like the rumbling of articulate thunder:\n\n\"Ho! Ye puling priests and devotees of a powerless God! Come forth and bow to Nathaire the master, before he sweeps you into limbo!\"\n\nIt was then that Gaspard, with a hardihood beyond comparison, rose from his hiding-place and stood in full view of the raging colossus.\n\n\"Draw nearer, Nathaire, if indeed it be you, foul robber of tombs and charnels,\" he taunted. \"Come close, for I would hold speech with you.\"\n\nA monstrous look of astonishment dimmed the diabolic rage on the colossal features. Peering at Gaspard as if in doubt or incredulity, the giant lowered his lifted cudgel and stepped close to the tower, till his face was only a few feet from the intrepid student. Then, when he had apparently convinced himself of Gaspard's identity, the look of maniacal wrath returned, flooding his eyes with Tartarean fire and twisting his lineaments into a mask of Apollyon-like malignity. His left arm came up in a prodigious arc, with twitching fingers that poised horribly above the head of the youth, casting upon him a vulture-black shadow in the full-risen sun. Gaspard saw the white, startled faces of the necromancer's pupils, peering over his shoulder from their plank-built basket.\n\n\"Is it you, Gaspard, my recreant pupil?\" the colossus roared stormily. \"I thought you were rotting in the oubliette beneath Ylourgne — and now I find you perched atop of this accursed cathedral which I am about to demolish! ... You had been far wiser to remain where I left you, my good Gaspard.\"\n\nHis breath, as he spoke, blew like a charnel-polluted gale on the student. His vast fingers, with blackened nails like shovelblades, hovered in ogreish menace. Gaspard had furtively loosened his leathern pouch that hung at his belt, and had untied its mouth. Now, as the twitching fingers descended towards him, he emptied the contents of the pouch in the giant's face, and the fine powder, mounting in a dark-grey cloud, obscured the snarling lips and palpitating nostrils from his view.\n\nAnxiously he watched the effect, fearing that the powder might be useless after all, against the superior arts and Satanical resources of Nathaire. But miraculously, as it seemed, the evil lambence died in the pit-deep eyes, as the monster inhaled the flying cloud. His lifted hand, narrowly missing the crouching youth in its sweep, fell lifelessly at his side. The anger was erased from the mighty, contorted mask, as if from the face of a dead man; the great cudgel fell with a crash to the empty street; and with drowsy, lurching steps, and listless, hanging arms, the giant turned his back to the cathedral and retraced his way through the devastated city.\n\nHe muttered dreamily to himself as he went; and people who heard him swore that the voice was no longer the awful, thunderswollen voice of Nathaire, but the tones and accents of a multitude of men, amid which the voices of certain of the ravished dead were recognizable. And the voice of Nathaire himself, no louder now than in life, was heard at intervals through the manifold mutterings, as if protesting angrily.\n\nClimbing the eastern wall as it had come, the colossus went to and fro for many hours, no longer wreaking a hellish wrath and rancour, but searching, as people thought, for the various tombs and graves from which the hundreds of bodies that composed it had been so foully reft. From charnel to charnel, from cemetery to cemetery it went, through all the land; but there was no grave anywhere in which the dead colossus could lie down.\n\nThen, towards evening, men saw it from afar on the red rim of the sky, digging with its hands in the soft, loamy plain beside the river Isoile. There, in a monstrous and self-made grave, the colossus laid itself down, and did not rise again. The ten pupils of Nathaire, it was believed, unable to descend from their basket, were crushed beneath the mighty body; for none of them was ever seen thereafter.\n\nFor many days no one dared to approach the place where the corpse lay uncovered in its self-dug grave. And so the thing rotted prodigiously beneath the summer sun, breeding a mighty stench that wrought pestilence in that portion of Averoigne. And they who ventured to go near in the following autumn, when the stench had lessened greatly, swore that the voice of Nathaire, still protesting angrily, was heard by them to issue from the enormous, rook-haunted bulk.\n\nOf Gaspard du Nord, who had been the saviour of the province, it was related that he lived in much honour to a ripe age, being the one sorcerer of that region who at no time incurred the disapprobation of the Church.",
        "content_cn": "I. 死灵法师的逃亡\n\n那臭名昭著的三重罪人纳赛尔——炼金术士、占星家兼死灵法师——带着他十名魔鬼赐予的学徒，在极度隐秘的情况下突然离开了维奥尼斯城。当地居民普遍认为，他逃离是出于对教会拇指夹与火刑柱的合理恐惧。在那段宗教审判异常狂热的年月里，名声不如他显赫的巫师们早已被绑上火刑柱；而众所周知，纳赛尔早已被教会列为异端。因此几乎无人认为他出走的原因存在谜团；但这位术士及其学徒所使用的转移方式，以及他们最终的去向，却被视作远超常理的难题。\n\n上千种阴暗迷信的流言四处蔓延；当行人靠近那座高耸阴森的宅邸时，都会匆忙画起十字——这座亵渎神明地建造在大教堂旁的建筑，被纳赛尔用充满恶魔般奢靡与诡异的家具填满。两名胆大包天的小偷在确认宅邸被遗弃后潜入其中，他们报告称大部分家具连同纳赛尔的书籍与器具都已随主人消失，无疑都去了同一个火焰深渊。这更增添了邪恶的谜团：因为显然不可能有人能神不知鬼不觉地用合法手段，将纳赛尔与十名学徒连同数车家当运出戒备森严的城门。\n\n更为虔诚的教徒们声称，是大魔王带着成群蝠翼仆从，在无月之夜将他们连人带物掳走。有些教士与体面市民信誓旦旦地说，曾目睹人形黑影与不可名状之物掠过星群，听见那群地狱归客在翻越城墙屋顶的邪云中发出凄厉哀嚎。\n\n另一些人相信巫师们通过邪术自行转移，退隐到了某处人迹罕至的堡垒。长期体弱多病的纳赛尔或许希望，能在宗教裁判所与无底坑的双重烈焰间，获得将死之人所能企及的些许安宁。据传他在五十余岁时首次为自己占星，结果推算出灾星汇聚的凶兆，预示死期将至。\n\n某些敌对占星师与咒术师则宣称，纳赛尔退隐只是为了不受干扰地与恶魔同谋，编织某种终极狼人诅咒的黑暗法术。他们暗示这些咒语终将降临维奥尼斯，乃至整个阿弗罗尼地区——或许会化作恐怖瘟疫、群体附身，或是席卷全境的梦魇侵袭。\n\n在诡异流言发酵之际，许多尘封的传说被重新提起，新的怪谈一夜成型。关于纳赛尔六年前定居维奥尼斯前那些晦暗出身与可疑游历的传闻愈演愈烈。人们说他是恶魔之子，如同传说中的梅林：其父乃复仇魔神阿拉斯托尔，其母则是畸形侏儒女巫。前者赋予他恶毒心性，后者造就他矮小身躯。\n\n他曾游历东方国度，向埃及与撒拉森导师学习死灵术的渎神技艺，并在此道登峰造极。有阴森耳语称他驱使过陈年腐尸、森森白骨，甚至逼迫末日天使才有权唤醒的亡者效劳。尽管许多人曾为私事求助于他，但他始终声名狼藉。定居维奥尼斯的第三年，他因施行死灵法术的传闻当众遭乱石袭击，一块精准的鹅卵石令他终身跛足。据说他从未原谅这次伤害，并以敌基督般的仇恨回报教会的敌意。\n\n除却公认的邪术恶行，他长期被视为青年腐蚀者。尽管身材矮小畸形，他却拥有非凡的催眠蛊惑力。那些被他诱入无底罪恶深渊的学徒，原本都是前途无量的青年才俊。总体而言，他的消失被视作天意眷顾的解脱。\n\n全城唯有一人未参与这些阴郁揣测——加斯帕·杜·诺尔。这位禁术研习者曾作为纳赛尔门徒一年，却在得知进阶仪式将涉及的骇人行径后悄然离去。不过他带走了大量珍奇知识，以及对死灵法师邪恶力量与晦暗动机的深刻认知。\n\n正因如此，加斯帕听闻纳赛尔离去时选择沉默。他也不愿重提那段学徒经历。在简陋阁楼里，他对着镶有金蛇纹的矩形魔镜皱眉——这曾是纳赛尔的财产。\n\n令他蹙眉的并非镜中那张俊秀年轻却隐现细纹的面容。这面魔镜本就不会映照观察者的相貌。方才他在镜中窥见一幅诡异凶兆的场景，虽认出参与者，却辨不出地点所在。未及细看，镜面便如炼金烟雾般模糊了。\n\n他明白这种遮蔽只意味一件事：纳赛尔察觉被窥视并施加了反制咒语。这个认知，加上惊鸿一瞥中纳赛尔正在进行的诡秘活动，让加斯帕心中缓缓升起刺骨寒意——某种尚未成形、难以名状的恐怖。\n\n2. 亡者集结\n\n纳赛尔与学徒们的消失发生在1281年春末无月之夜。随后新月在鲜花盛放的田野与鲜亮树林间渐盈渐亏。随着月缺，人们开始谈论其他法师的新谜团。\n\n接着在初夏无月的夜晚，发生了一系列比侏儒邪术师失踪更反常难解的事件。\n\n某日清晨，维奥尼斯城外墓园的掘墓人发现至少六座新坟被掘开，里面体面市民的遗体不翼而飞。细查之下，显然盗墓者绝非人类。斜插或直立的棺材皆由内而外爆裂，仿佛承受了非人巨力；新土翻涌的痕迹显示，死者竟似经历某种可怕的提前复活，自行挖通了重返人世的通道。\n\n尸体如被地狱吞噬般彻底消失，且无人目击其去向。在那个魔鬼横行的年代，唯一可信的解释是：恶魔占据尸体，驱使他们破土而出。\n\n令整个阿弗罗尼毛骨悚然的是，更多同类事件接踵而至。仿佛某种神秘不可抗拒的召唤正在召集死者。连续两周，维奥尼斯及周边城镇村庄的墓园每夜都会释放恐怖住客。黄铜密封的墓穴、公共藏骨堂、浅陋的乱葬坑、教堂大理石墓冢，这场诡谲的迁徙持续不断。\n\n更骇人的是，某些裹着尸布的新死者竟从灵柩跃出，无视惊骇的守夜人，以癫狂姿态纵身跃入黑夜，从此在哀悼者视野中永远消失。\n\n在所有案例中，失踪的尸体都是那些刚死去不久的年轻健壮男子——他们皆因暴力或意外而非慢性疾病丧命。有些是恶贯满盈的罪犯；有些是执行公务时遇害的士兵或治安官；还有比武或决斗中殒命的骑士；更多的是当时肆虐阿维罗涅的强盗团伙的受害者。修士、商人、贵族、自耕农、侍童、牧师——无一不是盛年而亡。那些衰老病弱者，似乎反倒逃过了恶魔的复苏。\n\n迷信者将这情形视为世界末日的前兆。撒旦正率领魔军作战，将神圣亡者的躯体掳往地狱。当人们发现即便是最慷慨的圣水泼洒、最严苛的驱魔仪式都完全无法阻止这种恶魔暴行时，恐慌更是百倍增长。教会承认无力对抗这种诡异邪恶；世俗法律更无法审判或惩罚那无形的存在。\n\n由于普遍蔓延的恐惧，无人尝试追踪那些失踪的尸骸。但夜归的旅人们讲述着骇人听闻的故事——他们曾在阿维罗涅的道路上遇见这些行尸，或独行或结队。那些亡灵看起来又聋又哑，毫无知觉，以可怕的速度坚定不移地奔向某个遥远而注定的终点。它们行进的大致方向似乎是东方；直到数百具尸体完成迁徙后，人们才开始怀疑亡者们真正的目的地。\n\n不知怎的，有流言开始流传：那目的地正是狼人出没的森林之外，阿维罗涅边陲半山区那座破败的伊鲁涅城堡。\n\n伊鲁涅这座由早已绝嗣的邪恶掠夺男爵家族建造的嶙峋巨堡，连牧羊人都避之不及。传说它摇摇欲坠的大厅里游荡着血腥领主们暴怒的幽灵，而城堡的女主人正是亡灵。没人愿意居住在那悬崖高墙的阴影下；最近的人类居所是山谷对面一英里外的小型西多会修道院。\n\n这座苦修教团的修士们与山外世界鲜少往来，高踞山门的修道院也罕有访客。但在那个可怖的夏季，随着尸体接连失踪，一则诡异不安的传闻从修道院传遍了整个阿维罗涅。\n\n自暮春起，西多会修士们不得不注意到从窗口就能望见的、古老荒废的伊鲁涅废墟中种种异象。他们目睹本不该存在的闪烁火光：诡异的蓝焰与猩红火舌在杂草丛生的残破箭窗后颤动，或沿着锯齿状城垛升向星空。夜晚的废墟随火焰传出骇人声响；修士们听见地狱铁砧与锤头的铿锵、巨型铠甲与钉头锤的震鸣，认定伊鲁涅已成为魔鬼的集结地。硫磺与焦肉的恶臭飘过山谷；即便在白昼声响停息、火光熄灭时，城垛上仍笼罩着地狱蓝雾的薄霭。修士们认为，显然有地下生物占据了此地——因为没人见过任何活物经由光秃裸露的山坡与峭壁接近城堡。观察到这些魔王活动的迹象后，他们以前所未有的热忱频繁画着十字，将主祷文与万福玛丽亚念得比以往更加冗长。他们也加倍苦修劳作。除此之外，既然古堡早已被人类遗弃，他们对这种占据行为未加理会，认为除非撒旦公然进犯，否则最好只管自家事务。\n\n他们保持着警惕；但数周内未见任何人实际进出伊鲁涅。除了夜间的火光噪音与白昼的缭绕雾气，并无人类或恶魔居住的证据。直到某个清晨，在修道院梯田花园下方的山谷里，两名在胡萝卜地锄草的修士目睹一队诡异行人经过——他们来自阿维罗涅大森林方向，正沿着陡峭嶙峋的山坡向伊鲁涅攀登。\n\n修士们坚称，这些行人以僵硬却飞快的步伐匆忙前行；全都面色惨白得不自然，穿着入殓时的衣衫。有些人的裹尸布已破烂不堪；所有人都风尘仆仆或沾着墓穴的霉斑。这群人约有十二个以上；其后还零星跟着几个同样装束的落单者。他们以惊人的敏捷速度爬上山，最终消失在伊鲁涅阴森的城墙间。\n\n此时关于被盗墓穴与尸架的传闻尚未传至西多会。这个信息是后来送达的——在他们连续多日清晨目睹或大或小的亡者队伍经过、前往恶魔盘踞的城堡之后。他们发誓，已有数百具行尸从修道院下方经过；黑暗中无疑还有更多未被察觉。但没有一具曾被看见从伊鲁涅返回——那座城堡如同永不反刍的深渊般吞噬了他们。\n\n尽管惊恐万状且深感愤慨，修士们仍认为按兵不动为妙。某些最大胆的修士被这些昭彰恶兆激怒，想带着圣水和高举的十字架探访废墟。但院长明智地命令他们等待。与此同时，夜间的火光愈发炽烈，噪音更加刺耳。\n\n就在这小修道院持续祈祷的等待期间，发生了可怕的事。修士中名为泰奥菲尔的壮实汉子屡次违反严规偷饮酒桶。无疑他是想浇灭对这些反常事件的虔诚恐惧。总之，痛饮后他不幸在悬崖间迷路摔断了脖子。\n\n怀着对死者堕落的哀恸，修士们将泰奥菲尔安置在礼拜堂，为他的灵魂吟诵弥撒。黎明前的黑暗时分，这些弥撒被死而复生的修士打断——他断裂的脖颈上头颅可怕地耷拉着，如恶灵附体般冲出礼拜堂，奔下山坡投向伊鲁涅的恶魔之火与喧嚣。\n\n3. 修士的证词\n\n上述事件后，两名曾想探访鬼堡的修士再次向院长请命，称上帝必会助他们报复泰奥菲尔尸身及其他众多圣墓遗骸被掳之仇。院长惊异于这些健壮修士的胆量——他们竟要直捣魔王巢穴——便准许他们前往，带着圣水洒与桦木巨十字架出发，那十字架沉重得足以击穿骑士头盔。\n\n名为伯纳德与史蒂芬的修士在上午果敢地向邪恶堡垒进发。路途险峻，需攀越悬岩与滑溜的陡坡；但二人既强壮又敏捷，且惯于此类攀登。闷热无风的天气很快让白袍汗渍斑斑；他们仅作短暂祈祷便继续前进，及时抵达城堡——其灰暗风化的城垛上仍看不出任何居住或活动的痕迹。\n\n曾环绕城堡的深壕早已干涸，部分被墙体崩塌的泥土碎石填平。吊桥朽烂殆尽；但外堡坍塌进壕沟的巨石形成了粗糙的堤道。修士们并非毫无惧意，他们如战士攻城般高举十字架，越过外堡废墟进入内院。\n\n这里与城垛一样杳无人迹。荨麻、杂草与树苗从铺路石缝中滋生。高大的主楼、礼拜堂及带有大厅的城堡部分历经数世纪颓圮仍保留主体轮廓。在宽阔内庭左侧，厅堂建筑群峭壁般的墙体上，一个门洞如黑暗洞窟般张开；淡蓝色雾霭从中涌出，如幽灵之环扭向无云的苍穹。\n\n走近门洞时，修士们看见内部闪烁的红光，恍如恶龙之眼在地狱昏暗中开阖。他们确信此处是厄瑞玻斯的前哨、深渊的前厅；但仍勇敢地踏入，高诵驱魔咒并挥舞沉重的桦木十字架。\n\n穿过幽深的门洞后，因刚离开夏日阳光，他们在昏暗中视线模糊。随着视力逐渐适应，一幕恐怖的场景在眼前展开，可怖怪诞的细节如潮水般涌现。有些细节晦涩难解却莫名骇人；另一些则清晰得如同突然烙在修士脑海中的地狱之火，永远无法抹去。\n\n他们伫立在一座巨室的入口处，这空间仿佛是由上层楼板与城堡大厅相邻的内墙倾颓而成，其本身便是个无比广袤的厅堂。这巨室在无尽阴影中向深处延伸，坍塌处漏下的阳光如利箭般刺入：那光线却无力驱散地狱般的阴森与诡秘。\n\n僧侣们后来坚称目睹众多人影在彼处活动，其间混杂着形形色色的恶魔——有些幽暗如巨影幢幢，有些则几乎与凡人无异。这些人与他们的魔仆正忙着照管反射炉，以及炼金术所用的巨型梨状与葫芦状容器。还有些人如巫师般俯身于蒸腾的大釜之上，忙于熬制可怖药剂。对面墙边矗立着两座石砌巨缸，圆形缸壁高过人头，令贝尔纳与斯特凡无法窥见其中之物。其中一缸泛着惨白微光，另一缸则蒸腾着暗红雾霭。\n\n巨缸之间稍近处，摆放着低矮的卧榻，铺着撒拉逊人编织的华美怪诞织物。僧侣们发现榻上蜷缩着苍白枯槁的侏儒，其冰冷火焰般的双眼如邪恶绿宝石在昏暗中闪烁。这奄奄一息的畸形生物正监督着人类与魔仆的劳作。\n\n两位修士恍惚的双眼开始辨认其他细节。他们看见中庭地板上横陈着几具尸体——其中包括泰奥菲尔的遗骸——与一堆关节断裂的人骨，以及屠夫作品般堆积的肉块。有人正将白骨投入下方燃着红宝石色火焰的大釜；另一人则将肉块掷入盛有无色液体的桶中，那液体嘶嘶作响恍若万蛇齐鸣。\n\n还有人正剥去某具尸体的寿衣，手持长刀开始肢解。另有数人沿着巨缸壁的粗陋石阶攀爬，倾倒盛满半流质物质的容器。\n\n目睹此等人魔共舞的亵渎景象，修士们燃起超乎正义的怒火，再度高诵驱魔咒文冲向前去。那些忙于邪恶勾当的巫师与魔鬼似乎并未察觉他们的闯入。\n\n满腔神圣怒火的贝尔纳与斯特凡正欲扑向那些肢解尸体的屠夫。他们认出这具尸体是恶名昭彰的亡命之徒雅克·勒卢普加鲁——此人前几日与官府交战时毙命。以蛮力、狡诈与凶残闻名的勒卢普加鲁长期肆虐阿弗尔涅的森林与大道。他魁梧的身躯已被警吏的利剑剖开大半；从太阳穴撕裂至嘴角的可怖伤口凝结着紫黑血块，将胡须黏结成硬壳。这罪人虽未临终忏悔，修士们仍不忍见其无助的尸身遭受基督徒难以想象的亵渎。\n\n此刻那苍白恶毒的侏儒已发现两位修士。他们听见他发出尖锐的命令式叫喊，压过了大釜不祥的嘶鸣与人魔的低语。\n\n那陌生语言的咒语般词句立刻产生了效果：两名男子中断邪恶的炼金术，抄起盛满恶臭液体的铜盆朝修士脸上泼去。\n\n腐蚀性液体如毒蛇噬咬般灼瞎了他们的双眼，恶臭烟雾令他们昏厥倒地，沉重的十字架从手中滑落。\n\n待视觉与其他感官恢复时，他们发现双手已被坚韧的肠绳捆缚，既无法挥舞十字架，也不能使用圣水洒布器。\n\n在这屈辱状态下，邪恶侏儒命令他们起身。失去双手辅助的修士艰难爬起——吸入毒雾的贝尔纳两次跌倒才勉强站直，引来巫师们淫邪的哄笑。\n\n侏儒用撒旦仆从特有的亵渎言语嘲弄着站立的修士。据他们事后宣誓作证，侏儒最后说道：\n\n\"滚回你们的狗窝吧，亚德巴约特的杂种，并捎去这个消息：来时为众，归时为一。\"\n\n随着侏儒念出骇人咒文，两道阴影般的巨兽形魔仆分别逼近勒卢普加鲁与泰奥菲尔兄弟的尸体。其中一只恶魔如沼泽雾气般钻入勒卢普加鲁血淋淋的鼻孔，长着犄角的兽首逐渐消失；另一只则同样钻入脖子折断、头颅怪异地耷拉在肩上的泰奥菲尔鼻腔。\n\n当恶魔完成附体，两具尸体以骇人姿态爬起——一具拖着从伤口垂落的肠子，另一具头颅软绵绵地垂在胸前。在魔鬼驱动下，尸骸拾起修士遗落的鹅耳枥木十字架，将其作为棍棒驱赶着修士。在侏儒与其巫术团伙的狂笑中，赤裸的勒卢普加鲁与裹着僧袍的泰奥菲尔将两位西多会修士追打到伊卢尔涅下方裂谷遍布的山坡，十字架的重击使他们后背血肉模糊。\n\n经历如此惨败，再无人敢挑战伊卢尔涅。此后整个修道院实行三倍苦修、四倍祈祷；在等待上帝旨意与魔鬼阴谋显明之际，保持着掺杂战栗的虔诚信仰。\n\n随着牧羊人将修士的见闻传遍阿弗尔涅，这场遭遇加剧了人们对集体失踪尸体的恐惧。无人知晓闹鬼城堡内的真相，也不知那数百具游荡尸骸的下落——修士们提供的线索虽骇人听闻却难下定论，而侏儒的讯息更充满神秘色彩。\n\n但所有人都感受到，在那倾颓的高墙内，某种巨大的威胁、某种黑暗的地狱邪术正在酝酿。那恶毒的垂死侏儒无疑就是失踪的巫师纳泰尔，其随从显然正是纳泰尔的学徒们。\n\n在阁楼独居的炼金术士兼巫师加斯帕·德诺尔——那位纳泰尔昔日的门徒——正反复尝试与蛇纹环绕的魔镜沟通，却始终徒劳无功。镜面始终笼罩着阴翳，仿佛蒸腾着撒旦炼金炉的浊烟或死灵术士火盆的秽气。经过数夜不眠的守候，形容枯槁的加斯帕深知，他的老师纳泰尔远比他自己更为警觉。\n\n当他忧心忡忡地研读星象布局时，预兆显示一场巨大灾祸即将降临阿维鲁瓦涅。然而灾祸的本质却晦暗不明。\n\n与此同时，可怖的死者复苏与迁徙正在发生。整个阿维鲁瓦涅因这多重暴行而战栗。如同孟菲斯瘟疫的无尽长夜，恐惧四处蔓延；人们屏息低语着每桩新暴行，不敢高声讲述这亵渎的故事。这些耳语也传到了加斯帕耳中；而当恐怖在仲夏初暂时平息后，更传来了关于西多会修士们的骇人传闻。\n\n此刻，这位长期受挫的观察者终于窥见了所求之事的蛛丝马迹。至少，那个逃亡的死灵法师及其学徒们的藏身之处已被揭露；消失的死者们也被明确追踪到了归宿。但对洞察力敏锐的加斯帕而言，仍有一个未解的谜团：纳泰尔在那偏远巢穴中酝酿的，究竟是何种亵渎的药剂，何等幽暗的邪术。加斯帕唯一能确定的是：那个濒死的暴躁侏儒，自知时日无多，又怀着对阿维鲁瓦涅人民无底的仇恨，必将准备一场空前绝后的恶毒魔法。\n\n即便了解纳泰尔的癖性，知晓这个侏儒掌握的近乎无穷的奥秘学识与深渊般的巫术储备，他也只能对这孕育中的邪恶形成模糊而恐怖的猜想。但随着时间推移，他感到一种日益深重的压抑——仿佛某种庞然威胁的阴影正从世界黑暗边缘爬来。他无法摆脱这种不安；最终决定不顾明显危险，秘密造访尤尔涅附近地区。\n\n尽管出身富裕家庭，此时的加斯帕却处境窘迫；因他投身于这门可疑学问而遭父亲断绝关系。他唯一的收入是母亲与妹妹暗中接济的微薄津贴，仅够支付简陋饮食、房租以及少量书籍、仪器和化学品；根本无力为这四十多英里的旅程购置马匹甚至骡子。\n\n他毫不气馁地徒步出发，只携带匕首与干粮袋。他精心安排行程，计划在满月升起时抵达尤尔涅。旅途大部分穿越那片绵延至维奥纳东墙、呈幽暗弧线贯穿阿维鲁瓦涅直至尤尔涅下方岩谷入口的阴森古林。穿过数英里松橡榉木组成的巨林后，他第一天沿着伊索尔河穿越开阔的居民平原。温暖的夏夜，他睡在某村庄附近的榉树下，不愿冒险在传闻栖息着盗匪、野狼——以及更凶名昭彰之物——的孤林中过夜。\n\n第二天黄昏，穿越古林最荒蛮原始的区域后，他来到了通往目的地的陡峭石谷。这处山谷是已缩成细流的伊索尔河发源地。暮色苍茫中，他望见西多会修道院的灯火；对面嶙峋骇人的悬崖上，矗立着尤尔涅废墟狰狞的轮廓，高耸箭孔后闪烁着苍白的巫火。除却这些火光，整座堡垒杳无人迹；他也未曾听到修士们描述的可怖声响。\n\n加斯帕等到浑圆的月亮——黄如某种夜行巨禽之眼——从幽暗山谷探出头来。由于不熟悉地形，他极其谨慎地向那座阴郁的城堡进发。\n\n即便对惯于攀爬者而言，月光下的城墙也充满危险。多次遭遇绝壁迫使他退回原路；全赖石缝中扎根的灌木荆棘，他才屡免坠崖之厄。当衣衫褴褛、双手血痕的他终于气喘吁吁攀至城墙下方的岩脊时，立即停步恢复体力。\n\n从制高点可见高耸主塔内墙反射着隐秘火焰的惨白微光。他听见一阵含混低鸣，其方位与距离皆难以辨别：时而似从黑色城垛飘落，时而又像源自山体深处的地底。\n\n除这诡异的嗡鸣外，夜晚凝固在致命的寂静中。连风都仿佛避开了这座恐怖城堡。无形而粘稠的邪恶阴云笼罩万物；苍白肿胀的月亮——女巫与术士的守护者——正向崩裂的塔楼倾泻比时间更古老的绿色毒光。\n\n当加斯帕继续向外堡废墟移动时，某种比疲惫更污秽的重压缠上了他。仿佛有无形邪秽织成的罗网阻碍前行，虚幻翅膀的恶臭扑打迎面而来。他呼吸间尽是腐败地窟涌出的浊风，耳中充斥无声的嘲弄或威胁的嚎叫，污秽之手似要将他推回。但他仍如顶风前行般低头前进，最终爬上杂草丛生的外堡废墟，潜入庭院。\n\n整座城堡看似荒废，大部分区域仍陷在墙垛阴影中。附近黑色银堞的建筑群里，加斯帕看见了修士们描述的洞开户门，内部透出沼泽鬼火般惨绿的幽光。嗡鸣声此刻已化为絮语，从门内传出；他隐约可见烟熏般的黑影在光亮处快速移动。\n\n借着远处阴影掩护，他沿庭院废墟迂回潜行。虽未见守卫，仍不敢靠近敞开的入口以免暴露。\n\n来到主塔附近时，他发现相邻长建筑裂开的缝隙将惨白光线斜射在上层墙面。这处离地甚高的开口原是石阳台的入口。一段残阶沿墙通向半毁的阳台遗迹。年轻人突然想到，或许能借此窥探尤尔涅内部而不被发现。\n\n部分台阶已然缺失，整个通道沉浸在浓影中。当一块被踩松的碎石坠落在庭院铺路石上发出巨响时，加斯帕惊惶暂停——所幸似乎未被察觉。稍顷，他继续攀爬。\n\n当他谨慎接近那个倾泻光线的巨大裂口时，狭窄的阳台残缘上呈现的景象令他蜷缩屏息：那令人震骇的场面细节如此混乱，足足数分钟他才理解其含义。\n\n显然修士们的描述（除却宗教偏见）毫不夸张。纳泰尔为施展邪术，几乎拆毁了半倾颓的城堡内部。这等工程必是动用了大量使魔与十名学徒方能完成。\n\n广阔厅堂被炼金炉与火盆的闪光断续照亮，而最耀目的是那些巨石缸里渗出的诡光。即便从高处，观察者也无法看清缸中物事：只见一口缸沿泛着苍白光晕，另一口则渗出肉色磷光。\n\n加斯帕德曾目睹纳泰尔某些实验与召唤仪式，对黑暗艺术的器具再熟悉不过。在某种限度内，他并非胆小之人；即便是那些在他脚下深渊中与黑袍学徒们共同劳作的幽暗畸形恶魔，也不至于使他过度惊惶。但当他看清占据大厅中央的庞然巨物时，一股刺骨寒意攫住了他的心脏——那具长达百尺的巨型人类骨架横亘在古堡大厅中，森然右足正被那群人与恶魔用鲜活人肉疯狂覆盖！\n\n这具完整得令人毛骨悚然的巨大骨骸，其肋骨犹如撒旦教堂的拱顶，在幽光中闪烁着地狱熔炉淬炼后的余温。它仿佛跳动着反常的生命力，在明灭光影中震颤着恶意的躁动。弯曲如爪的指骨在地板上蠢动，似要攫取无力反抗的猎物。参差巨齿永远凝固在讥诮而残忍的狞笑中，深若冥渊的眼窝里翻涌着无数嘲弄的星光，宛如秽暗深处浮游的元素生物之瞳。\n\n加斯帕德被这地狱绘卷般的骇人景象震慑。事后他始终无法确定某些细节，只依稀记得那些蝙蝠般的幽影在石槽与劳作群体间穿梭，将泛着血焰之光的猩红浆质如陶土般塑上骨足。他恍惚觉得那些飞影正用利爪从泛着玫瑰色光晕的石槽中运送浆质，而另一口泛着惨白微光的石槽则被完全冷落。\n\n当他寻找纳泰尔佝偻的身影时，脑后突然传来猫科动物般的脚步声。不及转身，后脑便挨了闷棍般的一击。在坠入黑暗前的刹那，他模糊感觉到袭击者拽住了他下坠的身躯。\n\n<5. 伊卢尔涅之怖>\n\n加斯帕德从冥河般的昏厥中苏醒时，正对上纳泰尔那双液态黑夜般的眼睛——其中燃烧着坠入永恒毁灭之境的冰冷星火。在意识混沌中，他长久只能看见这对悬浮在混沌暗处的眼眸，如同邪恶磁石将他从昏迷中拖出。渐渐地，巫师的其他特征与周遭可怖场景才浮现出来。\n\n他试图抬起疼痛的脑袋，发现双手已被紧缚。背部抵着的坚硬物体经辨认是废弃的炼金炉，周围散落着蒸馏器、坩埚与铁箍典籍，混杂成诡异的科学坟场。\n\n纳泰尔瘫在绣着阴郁金纹的东方软榻上，身后霉斑遍布的粗粝石墙与奢华织物形成怪诞反差。暗影中有喑哑低语传来，加斯帕德扭头看见石槽的玫瑰色光晕正被往复穿梭的蝠翼遮蔽。\n\n\"欢迎。\"纳泰尔开口时，嘶哑嗓音里透出的非人威压与这具枯槁身躯形成骇人对比。当加斯帕德质问那些被盗尸体的去向时，垂死的巫师爆发出被邪灵附体般的狂笑。\n\n\"我与天堂暴君的交易早已破裂。\"纳泰尔喘息着说，\"地狱或许终将收容我，但它已付出——且将继续付出——丰厚代价。我的死亡不过意味着以撒旦恩赐的巨人形态重生，向嘲弄我侏儒之躯的阿维罗尼人复仇。\"\n\n\"你疯了吗？\"年轻人被巫师眼中暴涨的冥河之光震慑。\n\n\"这是比生命更真实的奇迹。\"纳泰尔解释道，\"我的门徒们正用新鲜尸体为我铸造巨人之躯。当现世肉体消亡，我的灵魂将凭转生咒文入驻这具百尺骨架。可惜啊加斯帕德，若你早些到来，你的筋骨本可成为建材之一。\"\n\n巫师突然示意，加斯帕德立刻被无形之物架起。腐臭如裹尸布般的织物蒙住他双眼，在蜿蜒石阶下行时，蛇类的油腻麝香与死水恶臭交织扑来。当锈蚀铰链发出呻吟，他被推入某个被无数足迹磨蚀的潮湿地牢，永寂之门在身后轰然闭合。\n\n他听见一块巨石板被挪动的刺耳摩擦声。手腕上的绳索松开了，蒙眼布也被扯下。借着摇曳火把的光亮，他看见脚边渗着黏液的岩地上裂开一个圆形孔洞，旁边那块被掀起的石板原本是它的盖子。他还来不及转身看清绑架者的面容——分辨他们究竟是凡人还是恶魔——就被粗暴地抓住，猛地推入那张开的洞口。他在厄瑞玻斯般的黑暗中坠落，仿佛经历了无尽深渊的旅程，最终重重摔在底部。当他半昏迷地躺在浅而恶臭的水洼里时，听见头顶高处传来石板重新归位的沉闷声响，如同丧钟轰鸣。\n\n第六章 尤尔格尼地窖\n\n加斯帕德最终被身下冰凉的积水激醒。他的衣衫已浸透大半，第一次挪动身体时就发现，那张散发着毒气的滑腻水洼距离他的嘴唇仅一寸之遥。在这没有一丝光线的地牢黑夜里，他能听见某处持续而单调的滴水声。他踉跄着站起来，庆幸骨头没有摔断，开始谨慎地探索。移动时，污浊的水滴落在他头发和仰起的脸上；双脚在腐水中打滑，溅起恶心的水花；愤怒的嘶嘶声响起，蛇类生物冰凉的身躯滑过他的脚踝。\n\n他很快摸到一面粗糙的石墙，便用手指贴着墙面试图丈量这座地牢的规模。这地方大致呈圆形，没有棱角，他始终无法判断具体周长。在摸索途中，他发现墙边有堆高出水面的碎石，便赶走几条被惊扰的水蛇，将自己安置在这相对干燥的栖身之所。这些生物看似无害，可能属于某类水蛇，但它们黏腻鳞片的触感仍让他不寒而栗。\n\n坐在碎石堆上，加斯帕德开始梳理这令人绝望的恐怖处境。他虽已获悉尤尔格尼那震撼灵魂的可怖秘密，知晓了纳泰尔那亵渎神明的骇人计划，但此刻被囚禁在这恶魔盘踞的城堡深处、如同墓穴般恶臭的地牢里，根本无法向外界发出警告。从维约讷出发时带的干粮袋仍挂在背后，虽然已所剩无几。他摸索确认绑架者并未收走他的匕首。在黑暗中啃着发硬的面包皮，手指抚过珍贵武器的刀柄，他试图在密不透风的绝望中寻找裂隙。\n\n他无法测算时间如何像淤塞的泥河般缓慢流逝，只能听着无休止的滴水声——那或许是昔日供给城堡的山泉——打破死寂。这声响逐渐化作诡异的单调节奏，在他半昏迷的脑海中幻化成无形小恶魔永恒的窃笑。最终，精疲力竭的他坠入了梦魇缠身的昏睡。\n\n醒来时他无法分辨外界是正午还是深夜，因为地牢里始终充盈着凝滞的黑暗。他突然察觉到一股稳定的气流：阴湿不祥，如同阳光从未照拂的墓穴在他沉睡时苏醒了隐秘生机。这气流暗示着地下存在裂缝或通道，或许能成为逃生之路。他踉跄着朝气流方向摸索，不慎踢到某物，差点栽进蛇群游弋的腐水。未及查看，头顶突然传来刺耳的摩擦声，一道摇曳的黄光从地牢入口射下。他眯眼看见十英尺高的圆洞处，一只黑手正用绳索垂下装着粗面包和酒瓶的篮子。\n\n借着短暂的光亮，加斯帕德看清地牢约十五英尺宽，自己踢到的是一具半浸在腐水中的古旧骸骨，衣物早已霉烂成泥。在对侧墙底，他发现了那个可疑的洞口——仅有狐狸洞大小，淤塞的死水正缓缓流入。这景象让他心如死灰，因为即便水深足够，洞口也绝容不下成年人的躯体。当黑暗重新降临，他绝望地回到碎石堆，机械地吞咽着酸酒劣食。\n\n酒劲催生了灵感。他持匕首跪在恶臭淤泥中，忍受着水蛇在腿间爬行的恐怖，开始挖掘那半腐朽的墙壁。石块在刀尖下纷纷剥落，逃生希望使他忘却周遭可怖。不知过了多久，他终于挖通墙壁，像鼹鼠般在狭窄隧道中匍匐前进，直到能直起身子。\n\n这条倾斜的古老通道水深及腰，加斯帕德怀疑自己是否从骸骨地牢陷入了更糟的绝境。当他摸到右侧岔路时，发现了一段向上的台阶。他踏着渐浅的积水攀登，最终踩上干燥的石阶。这些蜿蜒无尽的台阶如同缠绕在尤尔格尼脏腑中的黑暗螺旋，沉闷如墓穴的空气里没有一丝他追寻的气流踪迹。不知它们通向何方，亦或是当初押解他的来路，他唯有在弥漫着毒雾的死寂中，喘息着持续攀登。\n\n在浓稠如实质的黑暗中，加斯帕德听见头顶极高处传来神秘而沉闷的轰鸣——那是巨石接连坠落的可怖闷响。这声音带着难以言喻的不祥与阴郁，震颤着周围深不可测的墙壁，连他脚下的台阶都随之泛起邪恶的共鸣。\n\n他加倍谨慎地向上攀爬，不时驻足倾听。那撞击声愈发震耳欲聋，仿佛近在咫尺，吓得他蜷缩在漆黑阶梯上不敢动弹。当这声响戛然而止时，留下的死寂比先前更令人窒息。\n\n怀着不祥的预感，加斯帕德继续攀登。忽然间，空洞的寂静被打破——远处传来诡异的吟诵声，如同恶魔弥撒中忽而哀鸣忽而狂喜的邪异颂歌。还未辨清词句，那精准如恶魔心跳的韵律已让他战栗不已。\n\n当螺旋阶梯第一百次转折时，加斯帕德终于挣脱黑暗，迎向头顶幽微的冷光。恶魔合唱此刻震耳欲聋，他惊恐地意识到：这是巫师们在进行某种极度污秽的终极召唤。当他踏上最后几级台阶时，伊鲁尔涅废墟里正在发生的恐怖真相终于揭晓。\n\n他谨慎地从地板边缘探出头，看见阶梯尽头正是当初目睹纳泰尔造物的那个大厅。整座城堡的内墙竟已消失无踪，月光混合着将熄的炼金炉火，在废墟上投下妖异的光晕。\n\n加斯帕德突然明白那些坠落巨石的来源——整面城墙被超自然力量拆毁了。当他领悟此举的真正目的时，恐惧使他全身汗毛倒竖。\n\n显然他已在地牢里度过整整一昼夜。月光下，那些曾散发磷光的大缸此刻死气沉沉。在缭绕的熏烟中，十名身着红黑袍的术士正进行着可憎的仪式。而躺在石地上的庞然巨物，赫然是放大了百倍的纳泰尔！\n\n那怪物山丘般的胸膛起伏着。在仪式间歇，加斯帕德甚至听见了雷鸣般的呼吸声。虽然巨人的眼睛仍闭着，但颤动的眼皮与抽搐的手指都预示着它即将苏醒。\n\n难以承受的恐惧攫住了窥视者，但他宁死也不愿返回地牢。他颤抖着沿墙边阴影潜行，透过翻腾的烟雾瞥见纳泰尔干瘪的躯体正静静躺在矮榻上——那侏儒要么已死，要么正陷入濒死昏迷。\n\n当邪教徒的颂歌达到高潮时，翻涌的烟雾再度遮蔽了矮榻。加斯帕德感到某种邪恶的灵魂转移即将完成。此时横亘在他与术士们之间的，正是那个微微动弹的呼吸巨人。\n\n未被发现的加斯帕德狂奔过庭院，头也不回地逃下伊鲁尔涅陡坡。在他身后，被地狱玷污的尸骸诞生的可怖巨人，即将如上古神族般向人间宣泄怒火。\n\n7. 巨像降临\n\n即便在亡灵大军撤离后，恐惧仍如棺衣般笼罩着阿弗罗涅。天空显现凶兆：东边山后坠落的火流星，南方夜空中扫过群星的彗尾。白昼闷热得如同熔炉，远方雷云像围城的泰坦军团般挥舞闪电。牲畜间蔓延的瘟疫更印证了人们的忧虑——地狱正在酝酿某种阴谋。\n\n但除了加斯帕德，无人知晓这威胁的真实形态。当他在凸月下疯狂逃往维约讷时，甚至认为警告沿途村庄都毫无意义：面对这个从被亵渎的尸窟中爬出的巨人，人类能逃往何处？\n\n整整一天一夜，这个满身地牢污秽的疯子穿越盗匪与狼人出没的密林。黎明苍白的光箭刺穿树影，正午炽白的酷热将他褴褛衣衫上的秽物再度蒸成黏液。而在他脑海中，一个模糊而绝望的计划正在成形。\n\n与此同时，几位西多会修士成为继加斯帕德后首批见证恐怖的人。他们发誓看见巨人在硫磺火焰中突然起身，头颅与城堡主楼齐平。当那怪物一步跨过城墙废墟时，修士们跪地哀嚎，以为深渊之主亲自降临人间。\n\n当巨人跃下山坡时，人们看清了那张融合了魔鬼与尸骸特征的面孔：纠结如黑蟒的乱发，惨白如死尸的皮肤下涌动着泰坦般的力量。那双没有眼皮的眼睛，如同无底深渊燃烧的熔炉。\n\n他即将到来的传闻如一阵恐惧的飓风席卷修道院。许多修士将谨慎视作宗教热忱的精髓，纷纷躲进石砌的地窖与拱顶密室。另一些人蜷缩在各自的小室里，语无伦次地向诸圣徒发出含混不清的尖叫与祈求。而最为勇敢的那些人则集体聚集在礼拜堂内，跪伏在巨大十字架的木质基督像前庄严祈祷。\n\n伯纳德与斯特凡挨过那顿毒打后刚恢复些许，此刻唯有他们胆敢窥视那巨人的逼近。当二人从那庞然面容中辨认出与尤尔格尼那个主持黑暗亵渎仪式的邪恶侏儒极度相似的特征时，难以言喻的恐惧陡然加剧。巨人沿山谷下行时发出的笑声，恍若暴风雨裹挟而来的回声——正是当初他们从那被诅咒的堡垒仓皇逃窜时，身后响起的可憎狞笑。在伯纳德与斯特凡眼中，这无疑是那个实为恶魔的侏儒现出了原形。\n\n巨人在谷底停驻，火焰充盈的双眼正对着修道院窗口——那正是两名窥视者藏身之处。他又发出骇人的笑声，如同地底深处的轰鸣。接着他俯身抓起一把巨石，仿佛那只是卵石般向修道院掷去。巨石如战争投石机发射的弹丸般撞击墙壁，坚固的建筑虽未倒塌，却在剧烈震颤中发出哀鸣。\n\n随后巨人双手掘出深埋山腰的巨岩，将其掷向顽固的墙壁。这一击彻底摧毁了礼拜堂的整面侧墙。后来人们在废墟中发现，那些聚集祈祷者已被砸成血肉模糊的肉酱，与他们雕刻的基督像碎片混作一处。\n\n此后巨人转身离去，仿佛不屑再与这般微不足道的猎物纠缠。他如同恶魔诞生的歌利亚，咆哮着走向阿弗罗尼山谷深处。伯纳德与斯特凡从窗口目睹了一个先前未曾注意的细节：巨人肩头悬挂着绳索捆扎的巨型木板篮，里面装着纳泰尔的十名学徒与助手，活像商贩包袱里的玩偶。\n\n关于巨人后续的暴行，阿弗罗尼流传着上百种传说——在这片恶魔肆虐的土地上，从未有过如此骇人听闻的残暴记录。尤尔格尼山下的牧羊人见他逼近，带着敏捷的羊群逃往最高处山脊。他对这些蝼蚁不屑一顾，只是将逃窜不及者如甲虫般踏碎。沿着伊索尔河的源头溪流行至森林边缘时，据说他徒手连根拔起参天古松，折断枝干制成巨棍。\n\n这根比攻城槌更沉重的凶器，将林间圣祠砸得粉碎。途经村庄时，他踏碎屋顶，推倒墙壁，将居民碾作脚下肉泥。整日里他如酩酊的独眼巨人般癫狂破坏，连最凶猛的野兽都闻风逃窜。狼群放弃猎物躲回岩穴哀嚎，贵族们的猎犬瑟缩在犬舍呜咽。\n\n人们听见他雷霆般的狂笑与怒吼，早在数里外便望风而逃。城堡领主召集士兵升起吊桥，农民藏身洞穴、地窖甚至干草堆。教堂挤满了祈求十字架庇护的难民，他们都认为撒旦或其麾下大将亲临人间。\n\n巨人不断用夏雷般的嗓音吐出亵渎咒骂，时而以师长口吻训诫背上那些黑袍身影。认识纳泰尔的人惊觉其面容与嗓音的相似，流言开始蔓延：那侏儒巫师通过与恶魔的交易，将可憎灵魂注入了这具泰坦之躯。他带着学徒归来，要向嘲笑其矮小身躯与巫术的世界宣泄无尽的怒火。更有人传言这怪物已公开承认自己的真实身份。\n\n若细数这掠夺者的暴行未免冗长......据说他像孩童撕扯昆虫般肢解逃亡者（多为教士与妇女）......还有更不堪言说的恶行......\n\n众多目击者讲述他如何追杀拉弗雷奈领主皮埃尔：单手抓起马匹与骑手，踏着树冠将其掷向城堡花岗岩墙壁。随后又将猎物赤鹿抛向血迹斑斑的墙面，那些撞击形成的猩红污渍历经秋雨冬雪仍无法褪尽。\n\n关于亵渎圣物的行径更是数不胜数：将木制圣母像与腐烂的铠甲匪徒绑在一起投入伊索尔河；徒手掘出未祝圣坟墓的蛆虫尸体扔进佩里贡修道院；甚至收集周边农场的粪堆，将圣泽诺比教堂连同内部的神职人员活埋其中。\n\n8.巨人的陨落\n\n这恶魔附体般的巨人不知疲倦地蹂躏着这片土地，如同收割者留下绵长的刈痕，身后只余不断延伸的废墟与尸骸。当村庄燃烧的黑烟遮蔽夕阳，人们仍在暮色中看见他移动的轮廓，听见那预示不祥的疯狂笑声在风暴中回荡。\n\n日落时分，当加斯帕德·杜·诺德接近维约纳城门时，透过古木间隙仍能望见远处可怖巨人的头颅与肩膀——他正沿着伊索尔河行进，不时俯身施行某种恐怖之举。\n\n尽管疲惫不堪，加斯帕德仍加快了脚步。但他相信这怪物次日才会进犯纳泰尔最憎恶的维约纳城。那巫师邪恶的灵魂正沉醉于近乎无限的破坏力，必将把终极复仇延至天明，今夜则继续蹂躏周边村落。\n\n尽管衣衫褴褛污秽得难以辨认，守城卫兵仍放加斯帕德入了城。维约纳已挤满从周边逃来的难民，无人会被拒之门外。城墙上弓箭手与长矛兵严阵以待，弩兵驻守城门，投石机沿墙垛密布。整座城市如同躁动的蜂巢般嗡嗡作响。\n\n街道上弥漫着歇斯底里的狂乱与骚动。苍白惊恐的面孔如无头苍蝇般四处奔窜，摇曳的火把在暮色中投下凄恻的光晕，仿佛厄瑞玻斯深渊升起的羽翼阴影正吞噬天光。无形的恐惧如蛛网般缠绕着每寸空气，令人窒息的压抑感淤积在昏暗中。加斯帕德如同精疲力竭却不肯屈服的泅渡者，逆着永恒粘稠的梦魇潮汐，缓慢挪向阁楼居所。\n\n事后他几乎记不起自己如何进食。当肉体与精神的耐力皆已耗尽，他裹着淤泥板结的破衣烂衫直接扑向草垫，昏沉睡去直至夜半时分。\n\n凸月惨白的光辉透过窗棂将他惊醒。起身后，他用后半夜进行某种隐秘准备——唯有如此，他认为才能对抗纳泰尔所创造并赋予生命的恶魔巨物。\n\n借着西沉月光与幽暗烛火，加斯帕德狂热地调配着熟悉的炼金材料。经过漫长而诡秘的仪式，他制出纳泰尔曾多次使用的暗灰色粉末。他推断这具由违逆天理复生的尸骸构成、仅凭死灵巫师灵魂驱动的庞然巨物，必定会受到这种专用于镇压复生死尸的粉末影响。若将粉末撒入其鼻腔，便能使这类亡者安息归墓。\n\n考虑到寻常剂量不足以安抚如此巨大的尸骸怪物，加斯帕德配制了足量药剂。当他念完赋予混合物效力的恐怖拉丁咒文时，泛白的晨光已吞没摇曳的烛焰。这段召唤阿拉斯托尔等邪魔协助的咒语令他心生抵触，但别无选择——唯有以邪术对抗邪术。\n\n维约尼斯城在崭新的恐惧中迎来黎明。加斯帕德凭直觉预感到，这具整夜以非人耐力游荡在阿弗罗涅的复仇巨像，必将于清晨逼近憎恶之城。直觉很快应验：他刚完成秘术准备，便听见街道骚动渐起，惊恐的尖叫声中混杂着远方巨人的咆哮。\n\n加斯帕德明白必须争分夺秒抢占制高点，才能将粉末撒入百尺巨像的鼻孔。城墙乃至多数教堂尖塔高度皆不足，唯有城市中心的大教堂屋顶堪当此任。他确信城墙守军根本无法阻止怪物入侵——凡俗武器甚至无法阻滞普通复生死尸的行动，遑论如此庞然邪物。\n\n他匆忙将粉末装入皮质巨囊系于腰间，随即汇入街上惊惶的人流。许多人正逃往大教堂寻求神圣庇护，他只需随狂乱人潮涌动即可。\n\n教堂中殿挤满信徒，主持庄严弥撒的牧师们嗓音因内心恐惧而颤抖。加斯帕德未被那群面色惨白的绝望者注意，悄然找到盘旋而上的阶梯，曲折通向外墙饰有石像鬼的塔楼顶端。\n\n他蜷缩在猫首狮鹫石雕后潜伏。从制高点望去，巨人的头颅与躯干已高耸于城墙之上。箭雨如乌云般袭向怪物，却未见其伸手拔除。投石机轰出的巨石于它不过砾石，深嵌皮肉的弩箭恍若木屑。\n\n无人能阻其步伐。东门城墙上持矛迎击的士兵们，被它七十尺松木棍横扫如蝼蚁。巨人随即翻越城墙闯入维约尼斯。\n\n它发出独眼巨人般的癫狂大笑，在仅及其腰的屋舍间阔步前行。不及逃命者皆遭践踏，巨棍挥击便令屋顶分崩离析。左掌随意推搡间，突出的山墙纷纷断裂，教堂尖塔伴着丧钟般的哀鸣倾覆。所经之处皆回荡着歇斯底里的凄厉哭嚎。\n\n正如加斯帕德所料，巨人直奔大教堂而来，显然欲将这座高耸建筑作为泄愤焦点。\n\n街道已空无一人，但怪物仍以攻城槌般的力道捅穿沿途墙垣窗棂，似要揪出藏匿者碾碎。其制造的破坏难以言表。\n\n很快它逼近加斯帕德藏身的塔楼。当那颗与塔楼齐平的头颅靠近时，燃烧硫磺般的双目凶光毕露。钟乳石状的獠牙间挤出憎恶的低吼，雷鸣般的话语震耳欲聋：\n\n\"嗬！你们这些无能之神的懦弱祭司与信徒！速来跪拜纳泰尔大人，否则便将尔等打入虚无！\"\n\n此刻加斯帕德以无匹勇气现身，直面暴怒的巨人。\n\n\"再靠近些，纳泰尔——若你真是那个盗墓亵尸的恶徒。\"他讥讽道，\"近前说话。\"\n\n巨人狰狞面目浮现错愕，暴怒稍敛。它狐疑地端详加斯帕德，缓缓放下高举的巨棍，将面孔凑至距这个无畏青年数尺之处。当确认对方身份后，狂暴怒意再度涌现，眼中腾起塔尔塔罗斯的烈焰，整张脸扭曲成堪比亚玻伦的恶相。左臂划出骇人弧线，抽搐的手指在青年头顶投下秃鹫般的阴影。加斯帕德瞥见巫师学徒们惨白惊惶的脸，正从巨人肩头的木板篮中窥视。\n\n\"是你吗，加斯帕德，我叛逆的门徒？\"巨人暴怒咆哮，\"我本以为你早该烂在伊卢尔涅的地牢里——如今却盘踞在这座待拆的诅咒教堂顶上！...乖乖留在原处才更明智啊，我亲爱的加斯帕德。\"\n\n他说话时呼出的气息，犹如墓穴中腐臭的阴风，吹拂在那学生脸上。他那巨硕的手指——指甲漆黑如铲刃——在头顶威胁地晃动，活像食人魔的利爪。加斯帕德悄悄解开腰间皮囊的束口，当那些抽搐的手指向他抓来时，他猛然将囊中粉末尽数倾洒在巨人脸上。灰黑色的尘雾升腾而起，顿时遮蔽了那张咆哮的嘴唇与翕动的鼻孔。\n\n他紧张地注视着效果，唯恐这些粉末终究敌不过纳泰尔高深的邪术与撒旦赋予的力量。然而奇迹般地，当那怪物吸入飞扬的尘雾时，深渊般的双眼中邪火骤然熄灭。高举的巨臂擦过蜷缩的青年，软绵绵地垂落身侧。那张扭曲的狰狞面孔突然平静下来，如同死人的脸；粗大的棍棒哐当一声砸在空荡的街道上；巨人拖着蹒跚的步子，双臂无力地晃荡着，转身背离大教堂，沿着满目疮痍的街道踉跄而去。\n\n他梦呓般喃喃自语，听见这声音的人都发誓说：那已不再是纳泰尔雷霆般的可怖嗓音，而是混杂着无数人声的呓语——其中分明可辨那些被亵渎的亡者之声。而纳泰尔本人的声音时而浮现于这片嘈杂，音量与生前无异，仿佛在愤怒地抗议着什么。\n\n这庞然巨物如同来时那般攀上东墙，漫无目的地游荡了数个时辰，不再发泄地狱般的狂怒，倒像是在——人们猜测——寻找组成其身躯的数百具尸体被掘出的墓穴。它辗转于乱葬岗与坟场之间，踏遍整片土地，却寻不到一处可供这死亡巨人安息的墓穴。\n\n及至黄昏，人们遥望见它伫立在血红色天际线下，用双手在伊索尔河畔松软的冲积平原上挖掘。最终，巨人在自掘的骇人墓穴中躺下，再未起身。据说纳泰尔的十名学徒因无法从吊篮脱身，全被压在那具伟岸躯体之下——此后无人再见过他们的踪影。\n\n整整多日，无人敢靠近那具暴露在自掘墓穴中的腐尸。盛夏骄阳下，它迅速溃烂，散发出令阿弗罗尼该地区瘟疫横行的恶臭。待到秋日臭气稍减时，冒险接近的人们发誓说：在乌鸦盘踞的庞大尸身上，仍能听见纳泰尔愤怒抗议的声音。\n\n至于拯救了行省的加斯帕德·杜·诺德，传说他备受尊崇地活到耄耋之年，成为当地唯一从未招致教会非议的术士。"

        "title": "The Mandrakes",
        "content": "\n\nGilies Grenier the sorcerer and his wife Sabine, coming into lower Averoigne from parts unknown or at least unverified, had selected the location of their hut with a careful forethought.\n\nThe hut was close to those marshes through which the slackening waters of the river Isoile, after leaving the great fosest, had overflowed in sluggish, reed-clogged channels and sedge-hidden pools mantled with scum like witches' oils. It stood among osiers and alders on a low, mound-shaped elevation; and in front, toward the marshes, there was a loamy meadow-bottom where the short fat stems and tufted leaves of the mandrake grew in lush abundance, being more plentiful and of greater size than elsewhere through all that sorcery-ridden province. The fleshly, bifurcated roots of this plant, held by many to resemble the human body, were used by Gilles and Sabine in the brewing of love-philtres. Their potions, being compounded with much care and cunning, soon acquired a marvelous renown among the peasants and villagers, and were even in request among people of a loftier station, who came privily to the wizard's hut. They would rouse, people said, a kindly warmth in the coldest and most prudent bosom, would melt the armor of the most obdurate virtue. As a result, the demand for these sovereign magistrals became enormous.\n\nThe couple dealt also in other drugs and simples, in charms and divination; and Gilles, according to common belief, could read infallibly the dictates of the stars. Oddly enough, considering the temper of the Fifteenth Century, when magic and witchcraft were still so widely reprobated, he and his wife enjoyed a repute by no means ill or unsavory. No charges of malefice were brought against them; and because of the number of honest marriages promoted by the philtres, the local clergy were content to disregard the many illicit amours that had come to a successful issue through the same agency.\n\nIt is true, there were those who looked askance at Gilles in the beginning, and who whispered fearfully that he had been driven out of Blois, where all persons bearing the name Grenier were popularly believed to be werewolves. They called attention to the excessive hairiness of the wizard, whose hands were black with bristles and whose beard grew almost to his eyes. Such insinuations, however, were generally considered as lacking proof, insomuch as no other signs or marks of lycanthropy were ever displayed by Gilles. And in time, for reasons that have been sufficiently indicated, the few detractors of Gilles were wholly overborne by a secret but widespread sentiment of public favor.\n\nEven by their patrons, very little was known regarding the strange couple, who maintained the reserve proper to those who dealt in mystery and enchantment. Sabine, a comely women with blue-gray eyes and wheat-colored hair, and no trace of the traditional witch in her appearance, was obviously much younger than Gilles, whose sable mane and beard were already touched with the white warp of time. It was rumored by visitors that she had oftentimes been overheard in sharp dispute with her husband; and people soon made a jest of this, remarking that the philtres might well be put to a domestic use by those who purveyed them. But aside from such rumors and ribaldries, little was thought of the matter. The connubial infelicities of Gilles and his wife, whether grave or trivial, in no wise impaired the renown of their love-potions.\n\nAlso, little was thought of Sabine's presence, when, five years after the coming of the pair into Averoigne, it became remarked by neighbors and customers that Gilles was alone. In reply to queries, the sorcerer merely said that his spouse had departed on a long journey, to visit relatives in a remote province. The explanation was accepted without debate, and it did not occur to any one that there had been no eye-witnesses of Sabine's departure.\n\nIt was then mid-autumn; and Gilles told the inquirers, in a somewhat vague and indirect fashion, that his wife would not return before spring. Winter came early that year and tarried late, with deeply crusted snows in the forest and on the uplands, and a heavy armor of fretted ice on the marshes. It was a winter of much hardship and privation. When the tardy spring had broken the silver buds of the willows and covered the alders with a foliage of chrysolite, few thought to ask Gilles regarding Sabine's return. And later, when the purple bells of the mandrake were succeeded by small orange-colored apples, her prolonged absence was taken for granted.\n\nGilles, living tranquilly with his books and cauldrons, and gathering the roots and herbs for his magical medicaments, was well enough pleased to have it taken for granted. He did not believe that Sabine would ever return; and his unbelief, it would seem, was far from irrational. He had killed her one evening in autumn, during a dispute of unbearable acrimony, slitting her soft, pale throat in self-defense with a knife which he had wrested from her fingers when she lifted it against him. Afterward he had buried her by the late rays of a gibbous moon beneath the mandrakes in the meadow-bottom, replacing the leafy sods with much care, so that there was no evidence of their having been disturbed other than by the digging of a few roots in the way of daily business.\n\nAfter the melting of the long snows from the meadow, he himself could scarcely have been altogether sure of the spot in which he had interred her body. He noticed, however, as the season drew on, that there was a place where the mandrakes grew with even more than their wonted exuberance; and this place, he believed, was the very site of her grave. Visiting it often, he smiled with a secret irony, and was pleased rather than troubled by the thought of that charnel nourishment which might have contributed to the lushness of the dark, glossy leaves. In fact, it may well have been a similar irony that had led him to choose the mandrake meadow as a place of burial for the murdered witch-wife.\n\nGilles Grenier was not sorry that he had killed Sabine. They had been ill-mated from the beginning, and the woman had shown toward him in their quotidian quarrels the venomous spitefulness of a very hell-cat. He had not loved the vixen; and it was far pleasanter to be alone, with his somewhat somber temper unruffled by her acrid speeches, and his sallow face and grizzling beard untorn by her sharp finger-nails.\n\nWith the renewal of spring, as the sorcerer had expected, there was much demand for his love-philtres among the smitten swains and lasses of the neighborhood. There came to him, also, the gallants who sought to overcome a stubborn chastity, and the wives who wished to recall a wandering fancy or allure the forbidden desires of young men. Anon, it became necessary for Gilles to replenish his stock of mandrake potions; and with this purpose in mind, he went forth at midnight beneath the full May moon, to dig the newly grown roots from which he would brew his amatory enchantments.\n\nSmiling darkly beneath his beard, he began to cull the great, moon-pale plants which flourished on Sabine's grave, digging out the homunculus-like taproots very carefully with a curious trowel made from the femur of a witch.\n\nThough he was well used to the weird and often vaguely human forms assumed by the mandrake, Gilles was somewhat surprized by the appearance of the first root. It seemed inordinately large, unnaturally white; and, eyeing it more closely, he saw that it bore the exact likeness of a woman's body and lower limbs, being cloven to the middle and clearly formed even to the ten toes! These were no arms, however, and the bosom ended in the large tuft of ovate leaves.\n\nGilles was more than startled by the fashion in which the root seemed to turn and writhe when he lifted it from the ground. He dropped it hastily, and the minikin limbs lay quivering on the grass. But, after a little reflection, he took the prodigy as a possible mark of Satanic favor, and continued his digging. To his amazement, the next root was formed in much the same manner as the first. A half-dozen more, which he proceeded to dig, were shaped in miniature mockery of a woman fsom breasts to heels; and amid the superstituous awe and wonder with which he regasded them, he became aware of their singularly intimate resemblance to Sabine.\n\nAt this discovery, Gilles was deeply perturbed, for the thing was beyond his compsehension. The miracle, whether divine or demoniac, began to assume a sinister and doubtful aspect. It was as if the slain women herself had returned, or had somehow wrought her unholy simulacrum in the mandrakes.\n\nHis hand trembled as he started to dig up another plant; and working with less than his usual care, he failed to remove the whole of the bifurcated root, cutting into it clumsily with the trowel of sharp bone.\n\nHe saw that he had severed one of the tiny ankles. At the same instant, a shrill, reproachful cry, like the voice of Sabine herself in mingled pain and anger, seemed to pierce his ears with intolerable acuity, though the volume was strangely lessened, as if the voice had come from a distance. The cry ceased, and was not repeated. Gilles, sorely terrified, found himself staring at the trowel, on which there was a dark, blood-like stain. Trembling, he pulled out the severed root, and saw that it was dripping with a sanguine fiuid.\n\nAt first, in his dark fear and half-guilty apprehension he thought of burying the soots which lay palely before him with their eldritch and obscene similitude to the dead sorceress. He would hide them deeply from his own sight and the ken of others, lest the murder he had done should somehow be suspected.\n\nPresently, however, his alarm began to lessen. It occurred to him that, even if seen by others, the roots would be looked upon merely as a freak of nature and would in no manner serve to betray his crime, since their actual resemblance to the person of Sabine was a thing which none but he could rightfully know.\n\nAlso, he thought, the roots might well possess an extraordinary virtue, and from them, perhaps, he would brew philtres of never-equalled power and efficacy. Overcoming entirely his initial dread and repulsion, he filled a small osier basket with the quivering, leaf-headed figurines. Then he went back to his hut, seeing in the bizarre phenomenon merely the curious advantage to which it might be turned, and wholly oblivious to any darker meaning, such as might have been read by others in his place.\n\nIn his callous hardihood, he was not disquieted overmuch by the profuse bleeding of a sanguine matter from the mandrakes when he came to prepare them for his cauldron. The ungodly, furious hissing, the mad foaming and boiling of the brew, like a devil's broth, he ascribed to the unique potency of its ingredients. He even dared to choose the most shapely and perfect of the woman-like plants, and hung it up in his hut amid other roots and dried herbs and simples, intending to consult it as an oracle in future, according to the custom of wizards.\n\nThe new philtres which he had concocted were bought by eager customers, and Gilles ventured to recommend them for their surpassing virtue, which would kindle amorous warmth in a bosom of marble or enflame the very dead.\n\nNow, in the old legend of Averoigne which I recount herewith, it is told that the impious and audacious wizard, fearing neither God nor devil nor witch-woman, dared to dig again in the earth of Sabine's grave, removing many more of the white, female-shapen roots, which cried aloud in shrill complaint to the waning moon or turned like living limbs at his violence. And all those which he dug were formed alike, in the miniature image of the dead Sabine from breasts to toes. And from them, it is said, he compounded other philtres, which he meant to sell in time when such should be requested.\n\nAs it happened, however, these latter potions were never dispensed; and only a few of the first were sold, owing to the frightful and calamitous consequences that followed their use. For those to whom the potions had been administered privily, whether men or women, were not moved by the genial fusy of desire, as was the wonted resuIt, but were driven by a darker rage, by a woful and Satanic madness, irresistibly impelling them to harm or even slay the persons who had sought to attract their love.\n\nHusbands were turned against wives, lasses against their lovers, with speeches of bitter hate and scatheful deeds. A certain young gallant who had gone to the promised rendezvous was met by a vengeful madwoman, who tore his face into bleeding shreds with her nails. A mistress who had thought to win back her recreant knight was mistreated foully and done to death by him who had hitherto been impeccably gentle, even if faithless.\n\nThe scandal of these untoward happenings was such as would attend an invasion of demons. The crazed men and women, it was thought at first, were veritably possessed by devils. But when the use of the potions became rumored, and their provenance was clearly established, the burden of the blame fell upon Gilles Grenier, who, by the law of both church and state, was now charged with sorcery.\n\nThe constables who went to arrest Gilles found him at evening in his hut of raddled osiers, stooping and muttering above a cauldron that foamed and hissed and boiled as if it had been filled with the spate of Phlegethon. They entered and took him unaware. He submitted calmly, but expressed surprize when told of the lamentable effect of the love-philtres; and he neither affirmed nor denied the charge of wizardry.\n\nAs they were about to leave with their prisoner, the officers heard a shrill, tiny, shrewish voice that cried from the shadows of the hut, where bunches of dried simples and other sorcerous ingredients were hanging. It appeared to issue from a strange, half-withered root, cloven in the very likeness of a woman's body and legs — a root that was partly pale, and partly black with cauldron-smoke. One of the constables thought that he recognized the voice as being that of Sabine, the sorcerer's wife. All swore that they heasd the voice clearly, and were able to distinguish these words:\n\n\"Dig deeply in the meadow, where the mandrakes grow the thickliest.\"\n\nThe officers were sorely frightened, both by this uncanny voice and the obscene likeness of the root, which they regarded as a work of Satan. Also, these was much doubt anent the wisdom of obeying the oracular injunction. Gilles, who was questioned narrowly as to its meaning, refused to offer any interpretation; but certain marks of perturbation in his manner finally led the officers to examine the mandrake meadow below the hut.\n\nDigging by lantern-light in the specified spot, they found many more of the roots, which seemed to crowd the ground; and beneath, they came to the rotting corpse of a woman, which was still recognizable as that of Sabine. As a result of this discovery, Gilles Grenier was arraigned not only for sorcery but also for the murder of his wife. He was readily convicted of both crimes, though he denied stoutly the imputation of intentional malefice, and claimed to the very last that he had killed Sabine only in defense of his own life against her termagant fury. He was hanged on the gibbet in company with other murderers, and his dead body was then burned at the stake.",

        "content": "\n\n1. The Deposition of Brother Gerome\n\nI, a poor scrivener and the humblest monk of the Benedictine Abbey of Perigon, have been asked by our abbot Theophile to write down this record of a strange evil that is still rampant, still unquelled. And, ere I have done writing, it may be that the evil shall come forth again from its lurking-place, and again be manifest.\n\nWe, the friars of Perigon, and all others who have knowledge of this thing, agree that its advent was coeval with the first rising of the red comet which still burns nightly, a flying balefire, above the moonless hills. Like Satan's rutilant hair, trailing on the wind of Gehenna as he hastens worldward, it rose below the ^Dragon^ [Lion] in early summer; and now it follows the Scorpion toward the western woods. Some say that the horror came from the comet, flying without wings to earth across the stars. And truly, before this summer of 1369, and the lifting of that red, disastrous scourge upon the heavens, there was no rumor or legend of such a thing in all Averoigne.\n\nAs for me, I must deem that the beast is a spawn of the seventh hell, a foulness born of the bubbling, flame-blent ooze; for it has no likeness to the beasts of earth, to the creatures of air and water. And the comet may well have been the fiery vehicle of its coming.\n\nTo me, for my sins and unworthiness, was it first given to behold the beast. Surely the sight thereof was a warning of those ways which lead to perdition: for on that occasion I had broken the rule of St. Benedict which forbids eating during a one-day's errand away from the monastery. I had tarried late, after bearing a letter from Theophile to the good priest of Ste. Zenobie, though I should have been back well before evensong. And also, apart from eating, I had drunk the mellow white wine of Ste. Zenobie with its kindly people. Doubtless because I had done these things, I met the nameless, night-born terror in the woods behind the abbey when I returned.\n\nThe day had vanished, fading unaware; and the long summer eve, without moon, had thickened to a still and eldritch darkness ere I approached the abbey postern. And hurrying along the forest path, I felt an eerie fear of the gnarled, hunchback oaks and their pit-deep shadows. And when I saw between their antic boughs the vengefully streaming fire of the new comet, which seemed to pursue me as I went, the goodly warmth of the wine died out and I began to regret my truancy. For I knew that the comet was a harbinger of ill, an omen of death and Satanry to come.\n\nNow, as I passed among the ancient trees that tower thickly, growing toward the postern, I thought that I beheld a light from one of the abbey windows and was much cheered thereby. But, going on, I saw that the light was near at hand, beneath a lowering bough beside my path; and moreover, it moved as with the flitting of a restless fenfire, and was wholly dissimilar to the honest glow of a lamp, lantern or taper. And the light was of changeable color, being pale as a corposant, or ruddy as new-spilled blood, or green as the poisonous distillation that surrounds the moon.\n\nThen, with ineffable terror, I beheld the thing to which the light clung like a hellish nimbus, moving as it moved, and revealing dimly the black abomination of head and limbs that were not those of any creature wrought by God. The horror stood erect, rising to the height of a tall man, and it moved with the swaying of a great serpent, and its members undulated as if they were boneless. The round black head, having no visible ears or hair, was thrust foreward on a neck of snakish length. Two eyes, small and lidless, glowing hotly as coals from a wizard's brazier, were set low and near together in the ^noseless^ [formless] face above the serrate gleaming of bat-like teeth.\n\nThis much I saw, and no more, ere the thing went past me with the strange nimbus flaring from venomous green to a wrathful red. Of its actual shape, and the number of its limbs, I could form no just notion. It uttered no sound, and its motion was altogether silent. Running and slithering rapidly, it disappeared in the bough-black night, among the antique oaks; and I saw the hellish light no more.\n\nI was nigh dead with fear when I reached the abbey and sought admittance at the postern. And the porter who came at last to admit me, after I had knocked many times, forbore to chide me for my tardiness when I told him of that which I had seen in the moonless wood.\n\nOn the morrow, I was called before Theophile, who rebuked me sternly for my breach of discipline, and imposed a penance of daylong solitude. Being forbidden to hold speech with the others, I did not hear till the second morn of the thing that was found before nones in the wood behind Perigon, where I had met the nameless beast.\n\nThe thing was a great stag which had been slain in some ungodly fashion, not by wolf or hunter or poacher. It was unmarked by any wound, other than a wide gash that had laid bare the spine from neck to tail; and the spine itself had been shattered and the white marrow sucked therefrom; but no other portion of the stag had been devoured. None could surmise the nature of the beast that slew and ravened in such a manner; but many, for the first time, began to credit my tale, which the abbot and the brothers had hitherto looked upon as a sort of drunken dream. Verily, they said, a creature from the Pit was abroad, and this creature had killed the stag and had sucked the marrow from its broken spine. And I, aghast with the recollection of that loathly vision, marveled at the mercy of God, which had permitted me to escape the doom of the stag.\n\nNone other, it seemed, had beheld the monster on that occasion; for all the monks, save me, had been asleep in the dormitory; and Theophile had retired early to his cell. But, during the nights that followed the slaying of the stag, the presence of this baleful thing was made manifest to all.\n\nNow, night by night, the comet greatened, burning like an evil mist of blood and fire, while the stars bleached before it and terror shadowed the thoughts of men. And in our prayers, from prime to evensong, we sought to deprecate the unknown ills which the comet would bring in its train. And day by day, from peasants, priests, woodcutters and others who came to visit the abbey, we heard the tale of fearsome and mysterious depredations, similar in all ways to the killing of the stag.\n\nDead wolves were found with their chines laid open and the spinal marrow gone; and an ox and a horse were treated in like fashion. Then, it would seem, the beast grew bolder-—or else it wearied of such humble prey as deer and wolves, horses and oxen.\n\nAt first, it did not strike at living men, but assailed the helpless dead like some foul eater of carrion. Two freshly buried corpses were found lying in the cemetery at Ste. Zenobie, where the thing had dug them from their graves and had laid open their vertebrae. In each case, only a little of the marrow had been eaten; but as if in rage or disappointment, the cadavers had been torn into shreds from crown to heel, and the tatters of their flesh were mixed inextricably with the rags of their cerements. From this, it would seem that only the spinal marrow of creatures newly killed was pleasing to the monster.\n\nThereafter the dead were not molested; but a grievous toll was taken from the living. On the night following the desecration of the graves, two charcoal-burners, who plied their trade in the forest at a distance of no more than a mile from Perigon, were slain foully in their hut. Other charcoal-burners, dwelling nearby, head the shrill screams that fell to sudden silence; and peering fearfully through the chinks of their bolted doors, they saw anon in the grey starlight the departure of a black, obscenely glowing shape that issued from the hut. Not till dawn did they dare to verify the fate of their hapless fellows, who, they then discovered, had been served in the same manner as the wolves and other victims of the beast.\n\nWhen the tale of this happening was brought to the abbey, Theophile called me before him and questioned me closely anent the apparition which I had encountered. He, like the others, had doubted me first, deeming that I was frightened by a shadow or by some furtive creature of the wood. But, after the series of atrocious maraudings, it was plain to all that a fiendish thing such as had never been fabled in Averoigne, was abroad and ravening through the summer woods. And moreover it was plain that this thing was the same which I had beheld on the eve of my return from Ste. Zenobie.\n\nOur good abbot was greatly exercised over this evil, which had chosen to manifest itself in the neighborhood of the abbey, and whose depredations were all committed within a five-hours' journey of Perigon. Pale from his over-strict austerities and vigils, with hollow cheeks and burning eyes, Theophile called me before him and made me tell my story over and over, listening as one who flagellates himself for a fancied sin. And though I, like all others, was deeply sensible of this hellish horror and the scandal of its presence, I marvelled somewhat at the godly wrath and indignation of our abbot, in whom blazed a martial ardor against the minions of Asmodai. \"Truly,\" he said, \"there is a great devil among us, that has risen with the comet from Malebolge. We, the monks of Perigon, must go forth with cross and holy water to hunt the devil in its hidden lair, which lies haply at our very portals.\"\n\nSo, on the afternoon of that same day, Theophile, together with myself and six others chosen for their hardihood, sallied forth from the abbey and made search of the mighty forest for miles around, entering with lifted crosses, by torchlight, the deep caves to which we came, but finding no fiercer thing than wolf or badger. Also, we searched the vaults of the ruined castle of Faussesflammes, which is said to be haunted by vampires. But nowhere could we trace the sable monster, or find any sign of its lairing.\n\nSince then, the middle summer has gone by with nightly deeds of terror, beneath the blasting of the comet. Beasts, men, children, women, have been done to death by the monster, which, though seeming to haunt mainly the environs of the abbey, has ranged afield even to the shores of the river Isoile and the gates of La Frênaie and Ximes. And some have beheld the monster at night, a black and slithering foulness clad in changeable luminescence; but no man has ever beheld it by day.\n\nThrice has the horror been seen in the woods behind the abbey; and once, by full moonlight, a brother peering from his window descried it in the abbey garden, as it glided between the rows of peas and turnips, going toward the forest. And all agree that the thing is silent, uttering no sound, and is swifter in its motion than the weaving viper.\n\nMuch have these occurrences preyed on our abbot, who keeps ~to} his cell in unremitting prayer and vigil, and comes forth no longer, as was his wont, to dine and hold converse with the guests of the abbey. Pale and meager as a dying saint he grows, and a strange illness devours him as if with perpetual fever; and he mortifies the flesh till he totters with weakness. And we others, living in the fear of God, and abhorring the deeds of Satan, can only pray that the unknown scourge be lifted from the land, and pass with the passing of the comet.\n\n[NOTE. Soon after the above deposition, Brother Gerome was found dead in his cell. His body was in the same condition, had been served in the same manner, as the other victims of the Beast.]\n\n2. The Letter of Theophile to Sister Therèse\n\n... To you, my sister in God as well as by consanguinity, I must ease my mind (if this be possible) by writing again of the dread thing that harbors close to Perigon: for this thing has struck once more within the abbey walls, coming in darkness and without sound or other ostent than the Phlegethonian luster that surrounds its body and members.\n\nI have told you of the death of Brother Gerome, slain at evening, in his cell, while he was copying an Alexandrian manuscript. Now the fiend has become even bolder; for last night it entered the dormitory, where the brothers sleep in their robes, girded and ready to arise instantly. And without waking the others, on whom it must have cast a Lethean spell, it took Brother Augustin, slumbering on his pallet at the end of the row. And the fell deed was not discovered fill daybreak, when the monk who slept nearest to Augustin awakened and saw his body, which lay face downward with the back of the robe and the flesh beneath a mass of bloody tatters.\n\nOn this occasion, the Beast was not beheld by anyone; but at other times, full often, it has been seen around the abbey; and its craftiness and hardihood are beyond belief, except as those of an arch-devil. And I know not where the horror will end; for exorcisms and the sprinkling of holy water at all doors and windows have failed to prevent the intrusion of the Beast; and God and Christ and all the holy Saints are deaf to our prayers.\n\nOf the terror laid upon Averoigne by this thing, and the bale and mischief it has wrought outside the abbey, I need not tell, since all this will have come to you as a matter of common report. But here, at Perigon, there is much that I would not have rumored publicly, lest the good fame of the abbey should suffer. I deem it an humiliating thing, and a derogation and pollution of our sanctity, that a foul fiend should have ingress to our halls unhindered and at will.\n\nThere are strange whispers among the brothers, who believe that Satan himself has risen to haunt us. Several have met the Beast even in the chapel, where it has left an unspeakably blasphemous sign of its presence. Bolts and locks are vain against it; and vain is the lifted cross to drive it away. It comes and goes at its own choosing; and they who behold it flee in irrestrainable terror. None knows where it will strike next; and there are those among the brothers who believe it menaces me, the elected abbot of Perigon; since many have seen it gliding along the hall outside my cell. And Brother Constantin, the cellarer, who returned late from a visit to Vyones not long ago, swears that he saw it by moonlight as it climbed the wall toward that window of my cell which faces the great forest. And seeing Constantin, the thing dropped to the ground like a huge ape and vanished among the trees.\n\nAll, it would seem, save me, have beheld the monster. And now, my sister, I must confess a strange thing, which above all else would attest the influential power of Hell in this matter, and the hovering of the wings of Asmodai about Perigon.\n\nEach night, since the coming of the comet and the Beast, I have retired early to my cell, with the intention of spending the nocturnal hours in vigil and prayer, as I am universally believed to do. And each night a stupor falls upon me as I kneel before Christ on the silver crucifix; and oblivion steeps my senses in its poppy; and I lie without dreams on the cold floor till dawn. Of that which goes on in the abbey I know nothing; and all the brothers might be done to death by the Beast, and their spines broken and sucked as is its invariable fashion, without my knowledge.\n\nHaircloth have I worn, and thorns and thistle-burs have I strewn on the floor, to awake me from this evil and ineluctable slumber that is like the working of some Orient drug. But the thorns and thistles are as a couch of paradisal ease, and I feel them not till dawn. And dim and confused are my senses when I awaken; and deep languor thralls my limbs. And day by day a lethal weakness grows upon me, which all ascribe to saintly pernoctations of prayer and austerity.\n\nSurely I have become the victim of a spell, and am holden by a baleful enchantment while the Beast is abroad with its hellish doings. Heaven, in its inscrutable wisdom, punishing me for what sin I know not, has delivered me utterly to this bondage and has thrust me down the sloughs of a Stygian despair.\n\nEver I am haunted by an eerie notion, that the Beast comes nightly to earth from the red comet which passes like a fiery wain above Averoigne; and by day it returns to the comet, having eaten its fill of that provender for which it seeks. And only with the comet's fading will the horror cease to harry the land and infest Perigon. But I know not if this thought is madness, or a whisper from the Pit.\n\nPray for me, Therèse, in my bewitchment and my despair: for God has abandoned me, and the yoke of hell has somehow fallen upon me; and naught can I do to defend the abbey from this evil. And I, in turn, pray that such things may touch you not nor approach you in the quiet cloisters of the convent at Ximes ....\n\n3. The Story of Luc le Chaudronnier\n\nOld age, like a moth in some fading arras, will gnaw my memories oversoon, as it gnaws the memories of all men. Therefore I write this record of the true origin and slaying of that creature known as the Beast of Averoigne. And when I have ended the writing, the record shall be sealed in a brazen box, and that box be set in a secret chamber of my house at Ximes, so that no man shall learn the dreadful verity of this matter till many years and decades have gone by. Indeed, it were not well for such evil prodigies to be divulged while any who took part in the happening are still on the earthward side of Purgatory. And at present the truth is known only to me and to certain others who are sworn to maintain secrecy.\n\nThe ravages of the Beast, however, are common knowledge, and have become a tale with which to frighten children. Men say that it slew fifty people, night by night, in the summer of 1369, devouring in each case the spinal marrow. It ranged mostly about the abbey of Perigon and to Ximes and Ste. Zenobie and La Fr~naie. Its nativity and lairing-place were mysteries that none could unravel; and church and state were alike powerless to curb its maraudings, so that a dire terror fell upon the land and people went to and fro as in the shadow of death.\n\nFrom the very beginning, because of my own commerce with occult things and with the spirits of darkness, the baleful Beast was the subject of my concern. I knew that it was no creature of earth or of the terrene hells, but had come with the flaming comet from ulterior space; but regarding its character and attributes and genesis, I could learn no more at first than any other. Vainly I consulted the stars and made use of geomancy and necromancy; and the familiars whom I interrogated professed themselves ignorant, saying that the Beast was altogether alien and beyond the ken of sublunar devils.\n\nThen I bethought me of the ring of Eibon, which I had inherited from my fathers, who were also wizards. The ring had come down, it was said, from ancient Hyperborea; and it was made of a redder gold than any that the earth yields in latter cycles, and was set with a great purple gem, somber and smouldering, whose like is no longer to be found. And in the gem an antique demon was held captive, a spirit from pre-human worlds and ages, which would answer the interrogation of sorcerers.\n\nSo, from a rarely opened casket, I brought out the ring of Eibon and made such preparations as were needful for the questioning of the demon. And when the purple stone was held inverted above a small brazier filled with hotly burning amber, the demon made answer, speaking in a voice that was like the shrill singing of fire. It told me the origin of the Beast, which belonged to a race of stellar devils that had not visited the earth since the foundering of Atlantis; and it told me the attributes of the Beast, which, in its own proper form, was invisible and intangible to men, and could manifest itself only in a fashion supremely abominable. Moreover, it informed me of a method by which the Beast could be banished, if overtaken in a tangible shape. And even to me, the student of darkness [and evil], the revelations were a source of horror and surprise.\n\nMusing on these dark matters, I waited among my books and braziers and alembics, for the stars had warned me that my intervention would be required in good time.\n\nToward the end of August, when the great comet was beginning to decline a little, there occurred the lamentable death of Sister Therèse, killed by the Beast in her cell at the Benedictine convent of Ximes. On this occasion, the Beast was plainly seen by late passers as it ran down the convent wall by moonlight from a window; and others met it in the shadowy streets or watched it climb the city ramparts, running like a monstrous beetle or spider on the sheer stone as it fled from Ximes to regain its hidden lair.\n\nTo me, following the death of Therèse, there came privily the town marshal, together with a priest from the household of the Bishop of Ximes. And the two, albeit with palpable hesitation, begged my advice and assistance in the laying of the Beast.\n\n\"You, Messire le Chaudronnier,\" they said, \"are reputed to know the arcanic arts of sorcery, and the spells that summon or dismiss evil demons and other spirits. Therefore, in dealing with this devil, it may be that you shall succeed where all others have failed. Not willingly do we employ you in the matter, since it is not seemly for the church and the law to ally themselves with wizardry. But the need is desperate, lest the demon should take other victims; and in return for your aid, we can promise you a goodly reward of gold and a guarantee of lifelong immunity from all inquisition and prosecution which your doings might otherwise invite. The Bishop of Ximes, and the Archbishop of Vyones, are privy to this offer, which must remain secret.\"\n\n\"I ask no reward,\" I replied, \"if it be in my power to rid Averoigne of this scourge. But you have set me a difficult task, and I must prepare myself for the undertaking, in which I shall require certain aid.\"\n\n\"All assistance that we can give you shall be yours to command,\" they said. \"Men-at-arms shall attend you, if need be; and all doors shall be opened at your request. We have consulted Theophile, the abbot of Perigon, and the grief-smitten brother of the lately slain Therèse, who is most zealous for the laying of the fiend, and will admit you to the abbey. The horror seems to center thereabout, and two of the monks have been done to death, and the abbot himself, it is rumored, has been haunted by the Beast. Therefore, it may be that you will wish to visit Perigon.\"\n\nI reflected briefly, and said:\n\n\"Go now, but send to me, an hour before sunset, two men-at-arms with horses and a third steed; and let the men be chosen for their valor and discretion: for this very night I shall visit the abbey.\"\n\nNow, when the priest and the marshal had gone, I spent several hours in making ready for my journey. It was necessary, above all other things, to compound a certain rare powder that had been recommended by the demon in the purple gem; for only by the casting of this powder could the Beast be driven away before its time. The ingredients of the powder were named in the Book of Eibon, that manual written by an old Hyper-borean wizard, who in his day had dealt with ultra-mundane spirits akin to the demon of the comet; and had also been the owner of the ring.\n\nHaving compounded the powder, I stored it in a bag of viper-skin. And soon after I had finished my preparations, the two men-at-arms and the horses came to my house, as had been stipulated.\n\nThe men were stout and tested warriors, clad in chain-mail, and carrying spears and swords. I mounted the third horse, a black and spirited mare, and we rode forth from Ximes toward Perigon, taking a direct and little-used way which ran for many miles through the werewolf-haunted forest.\n\nMy companions were taciturn, speaking only in brief answer to some question; and this pleased me, for I knew that they would maintain a discreet silence regarding that which might occur before dawn. Swiftly we rode, while the sun sank in a redness as of welling blood among the tall trees; and the darkness wove its thickening webs from bough to bough, closing upon us like some inextricable net of death and evil. Deeper we went, into the brooding woods; and even I, the master of sorceries, trembled a little at the knowledge of all that was abroad in the darkness.\n\nUndelayed and unmolested, however, we came to the abbey at late moonrise, when all the monks, except the aged porter, had retired to their dormitory. The porter, who had received word of our coming, would have admitted us; but this, as it happened, was no part of my plan. Saying I had reason to believe that the Beast would re-enter the abbey that very night, I told the porter my intention of waiting outside the walls to intercept it, and merely asked him to accompany us in a tour of the building's exterior, so that he could point out the various rooms. This he did, and during the course of the tour, he indicated a certain high window in the second story as being that of the abbot Theophile's chamber. The window faced the forest, and I remarked the abbot's rashness in leaving it open. This, the porter told me, was his invariable habit. Behind the window we could see the glimmering of a taper, as if the abbot were keeping late vigil.\n\nWe had committed our horses to the porter's care. After he had conducted us around the abbey and had left us, we returned to the space beneath Theophile's window and began our long watch in silence.\n\nPale and hollow as the face of a corpse, the moon rose higher, swimming above the somber oaks and pines, and pouring a spectral silver on the grey stone of the abbey walls. In the west the comet flared among the lusterless Signs, veiling the lifted sting of the Scorpion as it sank.\n\nWe waited hour by hour in the shortening shadow of a high pine, where none could see us from the abbey. When the moon had passed over, falling westward, the shadow began to lengthen toward the wall. All was mortally still, and we saw no movement, apart from the slow changing of the light and shade. Half-way between midnight and dawn, the taper went out in Theophile's cell, as if it had burned to the socket; and thereafter the room remained dark.\n\nUnquestioning, with ready spears, the two men-at-arms companioned me in that vigil. Well they knew the demonian terror which they might face before dawn; but there was no trace of trepidation in their bearing. And knowing much that they could not know, I held in my hands for instant use the bag of viper-skin that contained the Hyperborean powder.\n\nThe men stood nearer than I to the forest, facing it perpetually according to a strict order that I had given. But nothing stirred in the fretted gloom; and the skies grew paler, as if with morning twilight. Then, an hour before sunrise, when the shadow of the great pine had reached the wall and was climbing toward Theophile's window, there came the thing which I had anticipated. Very suddenly it came, and with no warning of its nearness, a horror of hellish red light, swift as a kindling, windblown flame, that leapt from the forest gloom and sprang upon us where we stood stiff and weary from our night-long vigil.\n\nOne of the men-at-arms was borne to the ground, and I saw above him, in a floating redness as of blood, the black and serpentine form of the Beast. A round and snakish head, without ears or nose, was tearing at the man's armor with sharp innumerable teeth, and I heard the teeth grate and clash on the linked iron as I stepped forward and flung the powder of Eibon at the Beast. The second man-at-arms, undaunted, would have assailed it with his spear, but this I forbade.\n\nThe floating powder, fine as a dust of mummia, seemed to dim the bloody light as it fell; and the Beast relinquished the fallen man, writhing away like a burnt serpent from the fire. Its members and body were loathfully convulsed; and the thing seemed to change horribly beneath our gaze, undergoing an incredible metamorphosis. Moment by moment it took on the wavering similitude of man, like a werewolf that returns from his beasthood; and the red light grew dimmer, and the unclean blackness of its flesh appeared to flow and swirl, assuming the weft of cloth, and becoming the folds of a dark robe and cowl such as are worn by the Benedictines. Then, from the cowl, a face began to peer, glimmering pale and thin in the shadow; and the thing covered its face with sooty claws that were turning into hands, and shrank away from me as I pressed upon it, sprinkling it with the remainder of the powder.\n\nNow I had driven it against the abbey wall; and there, with a wild, despairing cry that was half-human, half-demoniac, the thing turned from me and clawed frantically at the gray stone as if it would climb toward the abbot's window in that monstrous fashion that had been its wont. Almost, for a breath, it seemed to run upward, hanging to the wall like a bat or a great beetle. But the change had progressed too far, and it dropped back in the shadow of a pine, and tottering strangely as if with sudden mortal weakness, fell to the ground and lay huddled in its monkish garments like a black night-bird with broken vans.\n\nThe rays of the gibbous moon, sifting thinly through the boughs, lay cold and cadaverous on the dead face; though the body was immersed in shadow. And the face, even as I had expected, was that of the abbot Theophile, who had once been pointed out to me in Ximes. Already the peace of death was upon him; and horror had left no sign on the shut eyelids and the sealed lips; and there was no mark on the worn and haggard cheeks, other than that which might come from the saintly rigor of prolonged austerities.\n\nThe man-at-arms who had been struck down by the Beast was unharmed, though sorely bruised beneath his mail. He and his fellow stood beside me, saying naught; and I knew that they had recognized the dead abbot. So, while the moon grew grey with the nearness of dawn, I made them swear an awful oath of secrecy, and enjoined them to bear faithful witness to the statement I must make before the monks of Perigon.\n\nThen, having settled this matter, so that the good renown of the holy Theophile should rest unharmed, we aroused the porter and acquainted him with the abbot's lamentable death. And we told this story, averring that the Beast had come upon us unaware, and had gained the abbot's cell before we could prevent it, and had come forth again, carrying Theophile with its snakish members as if to bear him away to the sunken comet. Then, by means of a wizard powder, I had routed the unclean Beast, compelling it to relinquish its prey. And the thing had vanished in a cloud of sulphurous fire and vapor; but Theophile had died from the horror of his plight while the Beast was descending the wall. His death, I said, was a true martyrdom, and would not be in vain: the Beast would no longer plague the country or bedevil Perigon, since the use of Hyperborean powder was a sure exorcism.\n\nThis tale was accepted by the Brothers, who grieved mightily for their good abbot. Indeed, the tale was true enough in its fashion, for Theophile had been innocent and was wholly ignorant of the foul change that had come upon him nightly in his cell, and the deeds that were done by the Beast through his loathfully transfigured body. Each night the thing had come from the comet to assuage its hellish hunger; and being otherwise impalpable and powerless, it had used the abbot for its energumen, moulding his flesh in the image of some obscene monster from beyond the stars.\n\nAfter Theophile's death, the Beast was seen no more in Averoigne; and the murderous deeds were not repeated. And in time the comet passed to other heavens, fading slowly; and the black terror it had wrought became a varying legend, even as all other bygone things. And they who read this record in future ages will believe it not, saying that no demon or malign spirit could ever have prevailed upon true holiness. Indeed, it were well that none should believe the story: for strange abominations pass evermore between earth and moon and athwart the galaxies; and the gulf is haunted by that which it were madness for man to know. Unnameable things have come to us in alien horror, and shall come again. And the evil of the stars is not as the evil of earth.",
        "content_cn": "1. 热罗姆修士的证词  \n\n我，一个卑微的抄写员，佩里贡本笃会修道院最谦卑的修士，奉院长泰奥菲尔之命，记录下这份关于那仍在肆虐、尚未被制服的邪恶之物的证词。或许在我完成这份记录之前，那邪恶之物便会再次从它的藏身之处现身，重新显现于世。  \n\n我们佩里贡的修士们，以及所有知晓此事的人，都认为它的出现与那颗红色彗星的初次升起同时发生。那颗彗星至今仍在无月的山丘上空燃烧，如同一团飞驰的灾火。它宛如撒旦那赤红的发丝，在地狱的风中拖曳，随着他急速降临人间。初夏时分，它从狮子座下方升起；如今，它随着天蝎座向西方的森林移动。有人说，那恐怖之物正是来自这颗彗星，无翼而飞，穿越群星降临大地。的确，在1369年夏天之前，在那颗红色灾星尚未升上天空时，整个阿维罗涅从未有过关于此物的传闻或传说。  \n\n至于我，我必须认为这头野兽是第七层地狱的产物，是那沸腾、火焰与泥浆混合的污秽中诞生的怪物；因为它与大地上的野兽、天空与水域的生物毫无相似之处。而那颗彗星，或许正是它降临人间的火焰之车。  \n\n由于我的罪孽与不配，我成了第一个目睹这头野兽的人。那景象无疑是对那些通往毁灭之路的警告：因为在那一天，我违背了圣本笃的戒律，在离开修道院执行一日任务时进食。我耽搁至深夜，尽管本应在晚祷前返回，却仍留在圣泽诺比，与那里的善良人们一同饮用了醇美的白葡萄酒。毫无疑问，正是因为我做了这些事，当我返回修道院后的树林时，才遭遇了那无名、夜生的恐怖之物。  \n\n白昼悄然消逝，漫长的夏夜无月，当我接近修道院后门时，黑暗已凝结成一片诡异而古老的寂静。我匆匆穿过森林小径，对那些扭曲、驼背的橡树和它们深如坑洞的阴影感到一种莫名的恐惧。当我透过它们古怪的枝桠，看到那颗新彗星复仇般的流火时——那火焰仿佛在追逐着我——葡萄酒的暖意顿时消散，我开始为自己的怠惰感到后悔。因为我知道，这颗彗星是灾祸的先兆，是死亡与撒旦之力的预兆。  \n\n此刻，当我穿过那些高耸的古树，逐渐接近后门时，我以为自己看到了修道院某扇窗户透出的灯光，因而感到些许安慰。然而，继续前行后，我发现那光亮近在咫尺，就在我小径旁的一根低垂树枝下；更诡异的是，它如同不安的鬼火般闪烁移动，与灯、灯笼或蜡烛的寻常光芒截然不同。那光芒变幻不定，时而苍白如尸光，时而猩红如新洒的鲜血，时而翠绿如环绕月亮的毒雾。  \n\n随后，我怀着难以言喻的恐惧，看清了那光芒依附的物体——它如同一团地狱的光晕，随着移动而闪烁，隐约揭示出一个黑色、可憎的头颅与肢体，绝非上帝所造的任何生灵。那恐怖之物直立着，与高个子男人相当，行动时如同巨蛇般摇摆，肢体如无骨般蠕动。那圆形的黑色头颅没有可见的耳朵或毛发，向前伸出，支撑在一条蛇般的长颈上。两只眼睛小而无睑，如同巫师火盆中炽热的炭火，低低地嵌在那无鼻的面孔上，紧挨着蝙蝠般的锯齿牙齿。  \n\n我只看到了这些，随后那怪物便从我身旁掠过，诡异的光晕从剧毒的绿色转为愤怒的红色。至于它的确切形态和肢体的数量，我无法形成清晰的印象。它没有发出任何声音，动作也完全寂静无声。它快速滑行着，消失在古橡树间的漆黑夜色中，而那地狱般的光芒也随之消失。  \n\n当我抵达修道院后门，敲门请求进入时，几乎已被恐惧吞噬。门房最终为我开门时，听我讲述了在无月树林中的所见后，甚至没有责备我的迟到。  \n\n次日，我被召见至泰奥菲尔面前，他严厉斥责了我违反戒律的行为，并罚我独处一日。由于被禁止与他人交谈，直到第二天早晨，我才听说在我遭遇那无名野兽的佩里贡后方树林中，人们在午前发现了一具尸体。  \n\n那是一头巨大的雄鹿，以一种亵渎神灵的方式被杀害，既非狼、猎人或偷猎者所为。它身上除了一道从颈部延伸至尾部的巨大裂口外，没有任何伤痕；那道裂口暴露了它的脊柱，而脊柱本身已被粉碎，白色的骨髓被吸食殆尽；但雄鹿的其他部分却未被触碰。无人能推测出以这种方式杀戮与掠食的野兽究竟为何物；但许多人第一次开始相信我的故事，而院长与修士们此前一直将其视为某种醉酒的幻梦。他们惊恐地说，确实有一只来自深渊的生物在游荡，正是它杀死了那头雄鹿，并吸食了它破碎脊柱中的骨髓。而我，回想起那可憎的景象，不禁惊叹上帝的仁慈，竟让我逃脱了雄鹿的命运。  \n\n似乎当时再无人目睹那怪物；因为除我之外，所有修士都在宿舍中沉睡；而泰奥菲尔也早已回到他的小室。然而，在雄鹿被杀后的夜晚里，这邪恶之物的存在变得人尽皆知。  \n\n如今，夜复一夜，那颗彗星愈发壮大，如同一团血与火的邪恶迷雾般燃烧，而星辰在它面前褪色，恐惧笼罩着人们的思想。在我们的祈祷中，从晨祷到晚祷，我们试图祈求未知的灾祸不要随着彗星降临。日复一日，从农民、神父、伐木工和其他来访修道院的人口中，我们听到了与雄鹿之死如出一辙的可怕而神秘的掠夺故事。  \n\n人们发现了死去的狼，它们的脊骨被剖开，脊髓消失；一头牛和一匹马也遭到了同样的对待。随后，那野兽似乎变得更加大胆——或者厌倦了鹿、狼、牛马这类卑微的猎物。  \n\n起初，它并未袭击活人，而是像某种肮脏的食腐者般攻击无助的尸体。在圣泽诺比的墓地里，人们发现两具新近埋葬的尸体被从坟墓中挖出，脊椎被剖开。每种情况下，只有少量骨髓被吃掉；但仿佛出于愤怒或失望，尸体从头到脚被撕成碎片，血肉与寿衣的残片混杂在一起。由此看来，似乎只有新近被杀生物的脊髓才能取悦这头怪物。  \n\n此后，死者不再受到侵扰；但活人却付出了惨痛的代价。在亵渎坟墓的次日夜晚，两名在距离佩里贡不到一英里的森林中烧炭的工人，在他们的棚屋中被残忍杀害。附近的其他烧炭工人听到了尖锐的惨叫，随后突然归于寂静；他们战战兢兢地从门缝中窥视，在灰色的星光下，看到一个黑色、散发着亵渎光芒的形体从棚屋中离开。直到黎明，他们才敢确认不幸同伴的命运——发现他们与狼和其他受害者一样，遭到了同样的对待。  \n\n当这一事件的消息传到修道院时，泰奥菲尔召见了我，详细询问了我所遭遇的异象。他和其他人起初都怀疑我，认为我只是被阴影或森林中某种隐秘的生物吓到了。然而，在一系列残暴的掠夺之后，所有人都清楚地意识到，一种阿维罗涅传说中从未出现过的恶魔之物正在游荡，肆虐于夏日的森林中。而且，这显然正是我从圣泽诺比返回当晚所见的同一生物。  \n\n我们善良的院长对此邪恶之物深感忧虑，它选择在修道院附近显现，而它的掠夺行为全都在距离佩里贡五小时路程的范围内发生。泰奥菲尔因严苛的苦修与守夜而面容苍白，双颊凹陷，目光灼热，他反复召见我，让我一遍遍讲述我的经历，仿佛在鞭笞自己想象中的罪孽。尽管我和其他人一样，深切感受到这地狱般的恐怖及其存在的丑闻，但我对院长的神圣愤怒与愤慨仍感到些许惊讶——他对阿斯莫代的仆从燃起了战斗的激情。\"确实，\"他说，\"有一个大恶魔在我们中间，随着彗星从地狱深渊升起。我们，佩里贡的修士们，必须手持十字架与圣水，前往它的巢穴狩猎，或许那巢穴就在我们门前。\"  \n\n于是，在同一天的下午，泰奥菲尔、我以及其他六名被选中的勇敢修士，离开修道院，在周围的广袤森林中搜寻。我们高举十字架，手持火把，深入所遇的洞穴，却只发现了狼和獾这类生物。我们还搜索了据说有吸血鬼出没的福瑟弗拉姆废弃城堡的地窖。然而，我们未能追踪到那黑色怪物，也未能发现它的巢穴的任何迹象。  \n\n自那以后，盛夏在彗星的灾光下，伴随着夜复一夜的恐怖行径流逝。野兽、男人、儿童、女人，都被那怪物杀害。尽管它似乎主要出没于修道院周围，但它的活动范围甚至扩展到了伊索伊尔河岸，以及拉弗雷奈和希姆斯的大门。有些人在夜晚目睹过那怪物，一个黑色、滑行的污秽之物，披着变幻的光芒；但从未有人在白天见过它。  \n\n那恐怖之物三次在修道院后的树林中被目击；一次，在满月之下，一位修士从窗口窥见它在修道院的花园中滑行，穿过豌豆与芜菁的田垄，向森林移动。所有人都同意，那怪物是无声的，动作比蜿蜒的毒蛇更加迅捷。  \n\n这些事件极大地折磨着我们的院长，他持续在小室中祈祷与守夜，不再像往常那样出来与修道院的客人共餐交谈。他变得苍白消瘦，如同垂死的圣人，一种奇怪的疾病仿佛持续的高烧般吞噬着他；他苦修至虚弱蹒跚。而我们其他人，活在上帝的恐惧中，憎恶撒旦的行径，只能祈祷这未知的灾祸从这片土地上消失，随着彗星的离去而终结。  \n\n[注：在上述证词后不久，热罗姆修士被发现死在他的小室中。他的尸体与其他野兽受害者的状态相同，遭到了同样的对待。]  \n\n2. 泰奥菲尔致塞莱斯修女的信  \n\n……你既是上帝中的姐妹，也是血缘中的亲人，我必须再次写下关于那盘踞在佩里贡附近的恐怖之物，以舒缓我的心灵（如果这还有可能）：因为这邪恶之物再次在修道院的围墙内发动了袭击，在黑暗中无声无息地出现，除了它身体与肢体上那地狱般的光芒外，再无其他征兆。  \n\n我已告诉过你热罗姆修士的死亡，他在傍晚时分于小室中誊抄一份亚历山大手稿时被杀。如今，那恶魔变得更加大胆；昨夜，它进入了修士们穿着长袍、束腰入睡的宿舍。它没有惊醒其他人——想必对他们施了遗忘的咒语——而是带走了排在末位的奥古斯丁修士，他正在他的床榻上安睡。直到黎明时分，睡在奥古斯丁旁边的修士醒来，看到他的尸体面朝下躺着，长袍的背面与下方的血肉已成了一团血淋淋的碎片。  \n\n这一次，无人目睹那野兽；但在其他时候，它经常在修道院周围被看见；它的狡诈与胆量令人难以置信，除非是某个大恶魔的作为。我不知道这恐怖将如何终结；因为驱魔仪式与在所有门窗洒圣水的尝试都未能阻止野兽的入侵；而上帝、基督与所有圣徒都对我们的祈祷充耳不闻。  \n\n关于这邪恶之物给阿维罗涅带来的恐怖，以及它在修道院外造成的灾祸，我不必多言，因为这些消息想必已通过传闻传到你耳中。但在佩里贡这里，有许多事情我不愿公开，以免修道院的声誉受损。我认为这是一种屈辱，是对我们神圣性的贬低与玷污，竟让一个污秽的恶魔能够随意、无阻地进入我们的厅堂。  \n\n修士们中有奇怪的耳语，他们相信撒旦本人已现身侵扰我们。有几人甚至在礼拜堂中遭遇了那野兽，它在那里留下了亵渎至极的存在痕迹。门闩与锁对它毫无作用；高举的十字架也无法驱赶它。它来去自如；而那些目睹它的人无不陷入无法抑制的恐惧中。无人知道它下一次会在何处袭击；修士中有人认为它在威胁我，佩里贡的当选院长；因为许多人曾看到它沿着我小室外的走廊滑行。而修士康斯坦丁，不久前从维永返回时，发誓在月光下看到它攀爬墙壁，向我那面朝大森林的小室窗户移动。当康斯坦丁看到它时，那东西如同一只巨猿般落向地面，消失在树林中。\n\n除我之外，似乎所有人都已目睹那怪物。此刻，我的妹妹，我必须坦白一桩怪事——此事比任何证据都更能证明地狱之力在此事中的影响，以及阿斯莫代的羽翼正盘旋在佩里贡修道院上空。\n\n自彗星与野兽降临以来，每个夜晚我都早早回到密室，佯装彻夜祈祷。可每当我在银质十字架前跪拜基督时，总会陷入昏聩；罂粟般的遗忘浸透我的感官；直至黎明破晓，我都如尸体般躺在冰冷地板上毫无梦境。修道院中发生的一切我全然不知；即便兄弟们被野兽折断脊椎吸食骨髓——正如其一贯所为——我也毫无察觉。\n\n我铺上苦修用的鬃毛毯，撒满荆棘与蓟刺，企图从这如东方迷药般的邪恶魔咒中挣脱。可那些尖刺却化作天堂软榻，直到晨光熹微我才感受到它们的存在。苏醒时我的感官模糊混乱，四肢沉陷于致命的倦怠。日渐衰弱的躯体被众人赞颂为圣徒式彻夜苦修的荣光。\n\n我无疑已成为邪术的祭品，当那野兽带着地狱勾当横行时，恶毒咒法正禁锢着我。上天以莫测的智慧惩罚着我不自知的罪孽，将我彻底交付于这枷锁，推入冥河般的绝望深渊。\n\n有个诡谲念头始终纠缠着我：那野兽每夜从如烈火战车般掠过阿弗尔戈涅上空的赤红彗星降临，饱食猎物后又随白昼重返星空。唯有彗星消逝，恐怖才会停止肆虐佩里贡。但这究竟是疯癫妄念，还是深渊低语？我不得而知。\n\n为我祈祷吧，特蕾丝，为这中咒绝望之人：上帝已抛弃我，地狱枷锁莫名加身，我竟无力守护修道院免遭此劫。而我亦祈祷这些可怖之物不会侵扰你在希姆修道院静修的回廊……\n\n三、铜匠吕克的自白\n\n衰老如蛀蚀挂毯的飞蛾，正过早啃食我的记忆。故而我记录下这头阿弗尔戈涅之兽的真实起源与诛灭过程。待墨迹干涸，这份手稿将封存于铜匣，藏进希姆宅邸的暗室，直至数十年后世人方知这骇人真相。毕竟参与此事者尚在炼狱此岸时，此类邪恶异象绝不宜公诸于世。眼下除我与几位立誓守秘者外，无人知晓全貌。\n\n野兽的暴行却已妇孺皆知，成为吓唬孩童的夜谈。传说它在1369年夏夜接连杀害五十人，皆吸食脊髓。其活动范围多在佩里贡修道院至希姆、圣泽诺比及拉弗雷奈一带。无人知晓它的巢穴所在，教会与官府皆束手无策，死亡的阴霾笼罩着这片土地。\n\n因我常年与幽冥之事打交道，这头凶兽自然引起我的关注。我早知它非尘世或地狱造物，而是随烈焰彗星来自深空。但关于其本质特性，起初我并不比常人多知分毫。占星、地卜、通灵皆告徒劳，连我召唤的魔仆也声称这野兽完全超出月下恶魔的认知范畴。\n\n于是我取出祖传的艾本之戒——这枚据说源自远古极北之地、镶嵌着暗紫宝石的指环，囚禁着前人类时代的古老恶魔。当紫晶倒悬于炽热琥珀炭盆之上时，恶魔以火焰尖啸之声告知：此兽属星际恶魔族类，自亚特兰蒂斯沉没后便未造访地球；其本体对人类无形无质，仅能以极度可憎的形态显化。恶魔还透露了驱逐之法——前提是能逼它现形。即便对我这等钻研黑暗之术者，这些启示也令人毛骨悚然。\n\n当彗星渐趋黯淡的八月末，希姆本笃会修女特蕾丝在密室遇害。当晚多名目击者看见野兽如巨型甲虫般攀爬城墙逃遁。此后希姆城防官与主教特使秘密造访，以重金与豁免权为酬，恳请我诛杀此獠。\n\n\"无需报酬，\"我答道，\"若能为阿弗尔戈涅除害。但需两勇士日落前携三匹战马听候调遣。\"\n\n他们离去后，我按《艾本之书》配制了紫晶恶魔所述的奇异粉末，装入毒蛇皮袋。当两位披甲执矛的沉默武士如约而至，我们便取道人狼出没的密林小径直奔佩里贡。\n\n血阳西沉时，死亡蛛网般的黑暗将我们笼罩。月升之际抵达修道院，我让老门房指认了院长西奥菲尔敞开的二楼窗户——窗内烛光摇曳，显示主人正在守夜。我们潜伏在松影下，看着月光为灰石墙镀上尸衣般的银辉。西天彗星黯淡了天蝎座毒刺的光芒。\n\n子夜过后，院长室烛火猝灭。黎明前一小时，当松影爬上窗棂时，毫无征兆地——一道地狱红焰自林间扑来！两名武士立即横矛戒备，而我紧攥着盛有极北粉末的蛇皮袋。正如预言所示，终结的时刻到了。\n\n一名侍卫被扑倒在地，我望见血雾般的猩红中浮现出那野兽蜿蜒扭曲的漆黑形体。它生着蛇类般浑圆无耳无鼻的头颅，无数尖牙正撕咬着侍卫的铠甲。当我向前跨步撒出艾本之粉时，铁链甲上传来的利齿刮擦声令人毛骨悚然。另一名无畏的侍卫欲举矛刺击，却被我厉声制止。\n\n飘散的粉末如木乃伊尘灰般细密，坠落时仿佛令血光黯淡；那野兽松开倒地者，如同被火焰灼伤的毒蛇般痛苦扭动。它可憎的肢体剧烈痉挛，在我们注视下发生骇人畸变，每一瞬都更接近人形，犹如狼人褪去兽性。猩红光芒渐弱，它污秽的黑色血肉如织物般流动翻卷，逐渐化作本笃会修士特有的黑袍与风帽。\n\n风帽阴影中渐渐浮现一张苍白瘦削的面孔，当它正用逐渐化作人手的煤烟色利爪掩面退缩时，我将剩余粉末尽数洒向这个怪物。此刻我已将它逼至修道院墙边，它突然发出半人半魔的凄厉嚎叫，转身疯狂抓挠灰石墙面，似乎仍想以惯常的可怖方式攀向院长窗口。刹那间它竟如蝙蝠或巨甲虫般悬附墙面向上窜动，但蜕变已不可逆——最终它坠落在松影中，带着垂死者的踉跄颓然倒地，裹着僧袍的身躯宛如折翼夜鸦般蜷缩。\n\n下弦月的冷光如尸布般透过枝桠，映照在那张死寂的面容上；尽管身躯仍浸没在阴影里。正如我所料，这正是曾在希梅城指认给我的泰奥菲尔院长。死亡的宁静已笼罩其身，紧闭的眼睑与双唇未留恐惧痕迹，憔悴面颊上唯有长期苦修留下的圣徒印记。\n\n遭袭的侍卫虽铠甲下淤伤严重却性命无虞。他与同伴静立我身侧，沉默中我知晓他们已认出死者。当月光随黎明将至转为灰白时，我令他们立下可怖的缄默誓言，并命其为我即将在佩里冈修士会前的证词作见证。\n\n为保全圣徒泰奥菲尔的清誉，我们唤醒门房，宣告院长悲恸的死讯。我们编造说那野兽趁我们不备潜入院长密室，当其蜿蜒肢体挟持泰奥菲尔欲将其拖向陨落彗星时，我以秘法粉末驱退邪物。怪物最终在硫磺火雾中消散，而泰奥菲尔在野兽攀墙时因极度恐惧身亡。我宣称这乃是真正的殉道，其死非虚——因使用极北粉末确能永久驱邪，此兽再不会为祸乡里。\n\n修士们深信不疑，为善良的院长哀恸不已。某种意义上这故事确属实情，因泰奥菲尔始终不知每夜在自己密室发生的可怖异变，更不晓那借其污秽变形之躯行凶的恶行。那来自彗星的邪物每夜借院长肉身满足地狱饥渴——它本无形无质，却将院长躯壳重塑成星际之外某种不可名状的可憎形态。\n\n泰奥菲尔死后，阿弗罗涅再未见野兽踪迹，凶案亦绝迹。随着彗星远遁他方，这段黑色恐怖终成飘忽传说，如同所有湮灭往事。后世读者必难采信此录，认定真圣徒绝无遭邪灵附体之理。实则无人相信方为上策——因地球与月球间、银河裂隙中，永远游荡着人类知晓即疯的不可名状之物。来自异界的恐怖曾降临，亦将再临。星之邪恶，迥异于尘世之恶。"

        "content": "\n\nPrior to certain highly deplorable and scandalous events in the year 1550, the vegetable garden of Perigon was situated on the southeast side of the abbey. After these events, it was removed to the northwest side, where it has remained ever since; and the former garden-site was given to weeds and briars which, by strict order of the successive abbots, no one has ever tried to eradicate or curb.\n\nThe happenings which compelled this removal of the Benedictine's turnip and carrot patches became a popular tale in Averoigne. It is hard to say how much or how little of the legend is apocryphal.\n\nOne April morning, three monks were spading lustily in the garden. Their names were Paul, Pierre and Hughes. The first was a man of ripe years, hale and robust; the second was in his early prime; the third was little more than a boy, and had but recently taken his final vows.\n\nBeing moved with an especial ardour, in which the vernal stirring of youthful sap may have played its part, Hughes proceeded to dig the loamy soil even more diligently than his comrades. The ground was almost free of stones, owing to the careful tillage of many generations of monks; but anon, through the muscular zeal with which it was wielded, the spade of Hughes encountered a hard and well-buried object of indeterminate size.\n\nHughes felt that this obstruction, which in all likelihood was a small boulder, should be removed for the honour of the monastery and the glory of God. Bending busily, he shovelled away the moist, blackish loam in an effort to uncover it. The task was more arduous than he had expected; and the supposed boulder began to reveal an amazing length and a quite singular formation as he bared it by degrees. Leaving their own toil, Pierre and Paul came to his assistance. Soon, through the zealous endeavours of the three, the nature of the buried object became all too manifest.\n\nIn the large pit they had now dug, the monks beheld the grimy head and torso of what was plainly a marble woman or goddess from antique years. The pale stone of shoulders and arms, tinged faintly as if with a living rose, had been scraped clean in places by their shovels; but the face and breasts were still black with heavily caked loam.\n\nThe figure stood erect, as if on a hidden pedestal. One arm was raised, caressing with a shapely hand the ripe contour of shoulder and bosom; the other, hanging idly, was still plunged in the earth. Digging deeper, the monks uncovered the full hips and rounded thighs; and finally, taking turns in the pit, whose rim was now higher than their heads, they came to the sunken pedestal, which stood on a pavement of granite.\n\nDuring the course of their excavations, the Brothers had felt a strange, powerful excitement whose cause they could hardly have explained, but which seemed to arise, like some obscure contagion, from the long-buried arms and bosom of the image. Mingled with a pious horror due to the infamous paganry and nudity of the statue, there was an unacknowledged pleasure which the three would have rebuked in themselves as vile and shameful if they had recognized it.\n\nFearful of chipping or scratching the marble, they wielded their spades with much chariness; and when the digging was completed and the comely feet were uncovered on their pedestal, Paul, the oldest, standing beside the image in the pit, began to wipe away with a handful of weeds and grass the maculations of dark loam that still clung to its lovely body. This task he performed with great thoroughness; and he ended by polishing the marble with the hem and sleeves of his black robe.\n\nHe and his fellows, who were not without classic learning, now saw that the figure was evidently a statue of Venus, dating no doubt from the Roman occupation of Averoigne, when certain altars to this divinity had been established by the invaders.\n\nThe vicissitudes of half-legendary time, the long dark years of inhumation, had harmed the Venus little if at all. The slight mutilation of an ear-tip half hidden by rippling curls, and the partial fracture of a shapely middle toe, merely served to add, if possible, a keener seduction to her languorous beauty.\n\nShe was exquisite as the succubi of youthful dreams, but her perfection was touched with inenarrable evil. The lines of the mature figure were fraught with a maddening luxuriousness; the lips of the full, Circean face were half pouting, half smiling with ambiguous allure. It was the masterpiece of an unknown, decadent sculptor; not the noble, maternal Venus of heroic times, but the sly and cruelly voluptuous Cytherean of dark orgies, ready for her descent into the Hollow Hill.\n\nA forbidden enchantment, an unhallowed thralldom, seemed to flow from the flesh-pale marble and to weave itself like invisible hair about the hearts of the Brothers. With a sudden, mutual feeling of shame, they recalled their monkhood, and began to debate what should be done with the Venus, which, in a monastery garden, was somewhat misplaced. After brief discussion, Hughes went to report their find to the abbot and await his decision regarding its disposal. In the meanwhile, Paul and Pierre resumed their garden labours, stealing perhaps, occasional covert glances at the pagan goddess.\n\nAugustin the abbot came presently into the garden, accompanied by those monks who were not, at that hour, engaged in some special task. With a severe mien, in silence, he proceeded to inspect the statue; and those with him waited reverently, not venturing to speak before their abbot had spoken.\n\nEven the saintly Augustin, however, in spite of his age and rigorous temper, was somewhat discomfited by the peculiar witchery which seemed to emanate from the marble. Of this he gave no sign, and the natural austerity of his demeanour deepened. Curtly he ordered the bringing of ropes, and directed the raising of the Venus from her loamy bed to a standing position on the garden ground beside the hole. In this task, Paul, Pierre and Hughes were assisted by two others.\n\nMany of the monks now pressed forward to examine the figure closely; and several were even prompted to touch it, till rebuked for this unseemly action by their superior. Certain of the elder and more austere Benedictines urged its immediate destruction, arguing that the image was a heathen abomination that defiled the abbey garden by its presence. Others, the most practical, pointed out that the Venus, being a rare and beautiful example of Roman sculpture, might well be sold at a goodly price to some rich and impious art-lover.\n\nAugustin, though he felt that the Venus should be destroyed as an impure pagan idol, was filled with a queer and peculiar hesitation which led him to defer the necessary orders for her demolishment. It was as if the subtly wanton loveliness of the marble were pleading for clemency like a living form, with a voice half human, half divine. Averting his eyes from the white bosom, he spoke harshly, bidding the Brothers to return to their labours and devotions, and saying that the Venus could remain in the garden till arrangements were made for her ultimate disposition and removal. Pending this, he instructed one of the Brothers to bring sackcloth and drape therewith the unseemly nudity of the goddess.\n\nThe disinterment of this antique image became a source of much discussion and some perturbation and dissension amid the quiet Brotherhood at Perigon. Because of the curiosity shown by many monks, the abbot issued an injunction that no one should approach the statue, other than those whose labours might compel an involuntary proximity. He himself, at that time, was criticized by some of the deans for his laxness in not destroying the Venus immediately. During the few years that remained to him, he was to regret bitterly the remissness he had shown in this matter.\n\nNo one, however, dreamt of the grave scandals that were to ensue shortly. But, on the day following the discovery of the statue, it became manifest that some evil and disturbing influence was abroad. Heretofore, breaches of discipline had been rare among the Brothers; and cardinal offences were quite unknown; but now it seemed that a spirit of unruliness, impiety, ribaldry and wrongdoing had entered Perigon.\n\nPaul, Pierre and Hughes were the first to undergo penance for their peccancies. A shocked dean had overheard them discussing with impure levity, certain matters that were more suitable for the conversation of worldly gallants than of monks. By way of extenuation, the three Brothers pleaded that they had been obsessed with carnal thoughts, and images ever since their exhumation of the Venus; and for this they blamed the statue, saying that a pagan witchcraft had come upon them from its flesh-white marble.\n\nOn that same day, others of the monks were charged with similar offences; and still others made confession of lubric desires and visions such as had tormented Anthony during his desert vigil. Those, too, were prone to blame the Venus. Before evensong, many infractions of monastic rule were reported; and some of them were of such nature as to call for the severest rebuke and penance. Brothers whose conduct had heretofore been exemplary in all ways were found guilty of transgressions such as could be accounted for only by the direct influence of Satan or some powerful demon.\n\nWorst of all, on that very night, it was found that Hughes and Paul were absent from their beds in the dormitory; and no one could say whither they had gone. They did not return on the day following, Inquiries were made by the abbot's order in the neighboring village of Sainte Zenobie, and it was learned that Paul and Hughes had spent the night at a tavern of unsavoury repute, drinking and wenching; and they had taken the road to Vyones, chief city of the province, at early dawn. Later, they were apprehended and brought back to the monastery, protesting that their downfall was wholly due to some evil contagion which they had incurred by touching the statue.\n\nIn view of the unexampled demoralization which prevailed at Perigon, no one doubted that a diabolic pagan charm was at work The source of the charm was all too obvious, Moreover, queer tales were told by monks who had laboured in the garden or had passed within sight of the image. They swore that the Venus was no mere sculptured idol but a living woman or she-devil who had changed her position repeatedly and had re-arranged the folds of the sackcloth in such manner as to lay bare one shapely shoulder and a part of her bosom. Others avowed that the Venus walked in the garden by night; and some even affirmed that she had entered the monastery and appeared before them like a succubus.\n\nMuch fright and horror was created by these tales, and no one dared to approach the image closely. Though the situation was supremely scandalous, the abbot still forbore to issue orders for the statue's demolition, fearing that any monk who touched it, even with a motive so pious, would court the baleful sorcery that had brought Hughes and Paul to disaster and disgrace, and had led others into impurity of speech or actual impiety.\n\nIt was suggested, however, that some layman should be hired to shatter the idol and remove and bury its fragments. This, no doubt would have been accomplished in good time, if it had not been for the hasty and fanatic zeal of Brother Louis.\n\nThis Brother, a youth of good family, was conspicuous among the Benedictines both for his comely face and his austere piety. Handsome as Adonis, he was given to ascetic vigils and prolonged devotions, outdoing in this regard the abbot and the deans.\n\nAt the hour of the statue's disinterment, he was busily engaged in copying a Latin testament; and neither then nor at any later time had he cared to inspect a find which he considered more than dubious. He had expressed disapprobation on hearing from his fellows the details of the discovery; and feeling that the abbey garden was polluted by the presence of an obscene image, he had purposely avoided all windows through which the marble might have been visible to his chaste eyes.\n\nWhen the influence of heathen evil and corruption became manifest amid the Brothers, he had shown great indignation deeming it a most insufferable thing that virtuous, God-fearing monks should be brought to shame through the operation of some hellish pagan spell. He had reprobated openly the hesitation of Augustin and his delay in destroying the maleficent idol. More mischief, he said, would ensue if it were left intact.\n\nIn view of all this, extreme surprise and alarm were felt at Perigon when, on the fourth day after the exhumation of the statue, Brother Louis was discovered missing, His bed had not been occupied on the previous night; but it seemed impossible that he could have fled the monastery, yielding to such desires and impulsions, as had caused the ruin of Paul and Hughes.\n\nThe monks were strictly interrogated by their abbot, and it was revealed that Brother Louis, when last seen, had been loitering about the abbey workshop. Since, formerly, he had shown small interest in tools or manual labour, this was deemed a peculiar thing. Forthwith a visit was made to the workshop; and the monk in charge of the smithy soon found that one of his heaviest hammers had been removed.\n\nThe conclusion was obvious to all: Louis, impelled by virtuous ardour and holy wrath, had gone forth during the night to demolish the baleful image of Venus.\n\nAugustin and the Brothers who were with him repaired immediately to the garden. There they were met by the gardeners who, noticing from afar that the image no longer occupied its position beside the pit, were hurrying to report this matter to the abbot. They had not dared to investigate the mystery of its disappearance, believing firmly that the statue had come to life and was lurking somewhere about the garden.\n\nMade bold by their number and by the leadership of Augustin, the assembled monks approached the pit. Beside its rim they beheld the missing hammer, lying on the clodded loam as if Louis had cast it aside. Near by was the sacking that had clothed the image; but there were no fragments of broken marble such as they had thought to see. The footprints of Louis were clearly imprinted upon the pit's margin, and were discernible in strangely close proximity to the mark left by the pedestal of the statue.\n\nAll this was very peculiar, and the monks felt that the mystery had begun to assume a more than sinister tinge. Then, peering into the hole itself, they beheld a thing that was explicable only through the machinations of Satan — or one of Satan's most pernicious and seductive she-demons.\n\nSomehow, the Venus had been overturned and had fallen back into the broad deep pit. The body of Brother Louis, with a shattered skull and lips bruised to a sanguine pulp, was lying crushed beneath her marble breasts. His arms were clasped about her in a desperate, loverlike embrace, to which death had now added its own rigidity. Even more horrible and inexplicable, however, was the fact that the stone arms of the Venus had changed their posture and were now folded closely about the dead monk as if she had been sculptured in the attitude of an amorous enlacement!\n\nThe horror and consternation felt by the Benedictines were inexpressible. Some would have fled from the spot in panic, after viewing this frightful and most abominable prodigy; but Augustin restrained them, his features stern with the religious ire of one who beholds the fresh handiwork of the Adversary. He commanded the bringing of a cross, an aspergillus and holy water, together with a ladder for use in descending into the pit; saying that the body of Louis must be redeemed from the baleful and dolorous plight into which it had fallen. The iron hammer, lying beside the hole, was proof of the righteous intention with which Louis had gone forth; but it was all too plain that he had succumbed to the hellish charms of the statue. Nevertheless, the Church could not abandon its erring servant to the powers of evil.\n\nWhen the ladder was brought, Augustin himself led the descent, followed by three of the stoutest and most courageous Brothers, who were willing to risk their own spiritual safety for the redemption of Louis. Regarding that which ensued, the legends vary slightly. Some say that the aspersions of holy water, made by Augustin on the statue and its victim, were without palpable effect; while others relate that the drops turned to infernal steam when they struck the recumbent Venus, and blackened the flesh of Louis like that of a month-old cadaver, thus proving him wholly claimed by perdition. But the tales agree in this, that the strength of the three stout Brothers, labouring in unison at their abbot's direction, was impotent to loosen the marble clasp of the goddess from about her prey.\n\nSo, by the order of Augustin, the pit was filled hastily to its rim with earth and stones; and the very spot where it had been, being left without mound or other mark, was quickly overgrown by grass and weeds along with the rest of the abandoned garden.",
        "content_cn": "在1550年那桩极其可耻的丑闻事件之前，佩里贡修道院的菜园一直位于修道院东南侧。自那以后，菜园被迁至西北角，至今未变；而原先的园址则任由荆棘杂草丛生——历任修道院长都严令禁止任何人清理这片荒地。\n\n迫使本笃会修士们迁移萝卜胡萝卜田的变故，在阿弗罗尼地区演变成家喻户晓的传说。至于其中有多少真实成分，现已无从考证。\n\n某个四月的清晨，三位修士正在菜园里奋力翻土。他们分别名为保罗、皮埃尔和于格。第一位是体格健硕的壮年人；第二位正值盛年；而最年轻的于格刚立下终身誓愿不久，几乎还是个少年。\n\n或许是受到春日里年轻血液的躁动驱使，于格挖掘肥沃土壤的动作比同伴们更为热切。经过历代修士精心耕作的土地几乎不见碎石，但突然之间，于格手中的铁锹因用力过猛，撞上了深埋土中的坚硬物体。\n\n于格认定这阻碍物很可能是块小圆石，为修道院的荣誉与上帝的荣光，必须将其铲除。他弯腰忙碌地铲开潮湿的黑土，渐渐显露出埋藏物的轮廓。这工作比他预想的更为艰巨——随着土层剥落，所谓的\"圆石\"竟展现出惊人的长度与奇特的形态。保罗与皮埃尔见状也放下农具前来协助。很快，在三人的狂热挖掘下，土中之物的真容昭然若揭。\n\n在掘出的深坑里，修士们看见了布满泥垢的大理石头颅与躯干——这显然是古代的女性雕像或女神像。他们铲去了雕像肩臂处泛着活物般玫瑰色泽的苍白石材上的泥土，但面容与胸脯仍覆盖着板结的黑土。\n\n雕像笔直矗立，仿佛站在隐形基座上。一只纤手抬起轻抚圆润的肩颈曲线，另一只垂落的手臂仍埋在土中。随着挖掘深入，修士们相继挖出丰腴的臀部与浑圆的大腿。最后，当坑沿已高过他们头顶时，轮流作业的修士们发现了立于花岗岩地基上的下沉基座。\n\n挖掘过程中，修士们感受到某种难以解释的强烈躁动，仿佛某种隐秘的瘟疫正从雕像久埋的臂弯与胸脯散发出来。在对异教裸像虔诚的惊惧之下，暗涌着他们不愿承认的快感——若意识到这点，三人定会斥之为卑劣可耻。\n\n为避免刮伤大理石，他们格外谨慎地挥动铁锹。当基座上优美的双足终于重见天日时，年长的保罗站在坑中，用杂草擦拭雕像胴体上残留的污渍。他干得极为彻底，最后甚至用黑袍袖口为大理石抛光。\n\n略通古典学的修士们认出，这显然是古罗马统治阿弗罗尼时期遗留的维纳斯像——当年入侵者曾在此建立多座供奉这位女神的祭坛。\n\n历经半传说时代的沧桑与漫长黑暗的掩埋，这座维纳斯像几乎完好无损。掩映在鬈发下的耳尖微损，以及纤足中趾的局部断裂，反倒为慵懒的美貌平添几分摄人心魄的妖冶。\n\n她宛若少年春梦中的女妖般精致，但完美中透着不可名状的邪气。成熟躯体的曲线蕴藏着令人发狂的奢靡；丰润如喀耳刻般的双唇半嗔半笑，透着暧昧的诱惑。这绝非英雄时代高贵母性的维纳斯，而是某位佚名颓废艺术家的杰作——她是黑暗祭仪中狡黠而残忍的塞浦路斯淫妇，正待沉入空心山丘的深渊。\n\n某种禁忌的魅惑与渎神的魔力似乎正从苍白大理石中渗出，如同无形发丝缠绕修士们的心脏。他们突然羞愧地想起自己的修士身份，开始商讨如何处置这座与修道院格格不入的异教神像。简单商议后，于格前去向院长报告发现，等待处置决定。其间保罗与皮埃尔继续耕作，却不时偷瞥那座异教女神像。\n\n奥古斯丁院长很快带着闲散修士来到菜园。他面色严峻地检视雕像，众人恭敬静候，不敢先于院长发言。\n\n即便圣洁如老院长这般严苛之人，也被大理石散发的诡异魔力扰得心神不宁。但他未露端倪，反而愈发肃穆。他简短命令取来绳索，指挥众人将维纳斯像从泥坑移至旁边空地。保罗、皮埃尔和于格在两名修士协助下完成了这项任务。\n\n许多修士挤上前细看，甚至有人忍不住触摸，直到被院长呵斥。部分年长严肃的本笃会修士主张立即销毁这尊玷污圣地的异教秽物；而务实派则指出，作为罕见的罗马艺术珍品，大可卖给富有的艺术收藏家换取重金。\n\n奥古斯丁虽觉应摧毁这尊不洁偶像，却莫名犹豫不决。仿佛大理石中微妙放荡的美艳正在祈求宽恕，如同半人半神的活物。他移开凝视白晳胸脯的目光，厉声命令修士们回去劳作祈祷，并宣布神像暂留园中以待最终处置。期间他令修士取来粗麻布遮盖女神不雅的裸体。\n\n这座古像的出土在佩里贡宁静的修士团体中引发轩然大波。由于好奇者众，院长下令除必要劳作外，任何人不得接近雕像。当时就有教长批评院长未立即销毁神像的懈怠——余生数年里，老院长都将为此追悔莫及。\n\n然而无人预料到即将爆发的重大丑闻。就在发现神像次日，某种邪恶扰动开始显现。此前修士们纪律严明，重罪绝迹；如今佩里贡却弥漫着叛逆、渎神与猥亵的邪气。\n\n保罗、皮埃尔和于格最先因罪孽受罚。震惊的教长听见他们用世俗浪子的轻佻语气谈论淫秽话题。三人辩称自挖掘维纳斯像后，肉欲幻想便挥之不去，将之归咎于大理石中散发的异教巫术。\n\n同日，更多修士因类似罪行被指控，还有人坦白承受着如沙漠中的圣安东尼所遭遇的淫邪幻象折磨。晚祷前，修道院上报了诸多违规事件，其中某些恶劣行径需严惩不贷。就连素来品行端正的修士也犯下唯有撒旦直接引诱才能解释的罪行。\n\n最严重的是，当夜于格与保罗竟从宿舍失踪。次日调查发现他们在声名狼藉的圣泽诺比村酒馆纵情声色，黎明时分离城而去。后来两人被押回修道院，坚称堕落全因触碰雕像染上邪毒。\n\n面对修道院空前的道德崩坏，无人怀疑是异教邪术作祟。更诡异的是，在菜园劳作或途经神像的修士发誓，维纳斯绝非普通雕像——她会自行变换姿态，让麻布滑落露出香肩玉肌；有人说深夜看见她在园中漫步；更有人指证她如女妖般潜入寝室。\n\n这些传闻引发恐慌，再无人敢近观神像。尽管丑闻愈演愈烈，院长仍迟迟未下令销毁，唯恐执行者会如于格、保罗般遭邪术蛊惑。\n\n正当商议雇佣俗人粉碎神像时，修士路易斯突然狂热地采取了行动。\n\n这位出身名门的美男子修士，以阿多尼斯般的容貌与极端苦修著称。出土当日他正抄写拉丁文圣经，始终回避观看这尊\"可疑之物\"。当异教腐蚀在修士中蔓延时，他公开谴责院长犹豫不决，警告保留神像必酿大祸。\n\n因此当神像出土第四日，路易斯修士失踪的消息震惊全院。他的床榻整夜未动，但没人相信他会步于格、保罗的后尘。\n\n审问发现路易斯最后出现于修道院工坊——这个从不干活的苦修者竟对工具产生兴趣。铁匠随即发现少了柄最重的铁锤。\n\n众人皆得出了显而易见的结论：路易修士受虔诚热忱与神圣怒火的驱使，趁夜前去摧毁那座不祥的维纳斯像。\n\n奥古斯丁与随行修士立即赶往花园。途中遇见几名园丁，他们远远望见神像已不在坑穴旁的原位，正匆忙赶来向院长报告。这些人不敢探查神像消失之谜，坚信那尊雕像已然复活，此刻正潜伏在花园某处。\n\n在奥古斯丁的率领下，聚集的修士们壮着胆子靠近坑穴。坑沿处躺着失踪的铁锤，沾满泥块的锤身仿佛被路易随手弃置。附近散落着包裹神像的麻布，却不见他们预想中的大理石碎片。路易的脚印清晰地印在坑缘，诡异的是，这些足迹竟紧贴着神像基座留下的压痕。\n\n这一切都透着古怪，修士们感到谜团正蒙上不祥的阴影。当他们窥向坑底时，目睹了唯有撒旦——或某个极恶毒的魅魔——才能炮制的可怖景象。\n\n不知何故，维纳斯像已然倾覆，倒栽回宽阔的深坑中。路易修士的尸体被压在大理石胸脯下，颅骨碎裂，双唇淤肿如血糜。他的双臂以情人般绝望的姿态紧搂神像，死亡的僵直更强化了这个拥抱。然而最骇人听闻的是，维纳斯的石臂竟改变了姿势，此刻正紧紧环抱着死去的修士，仿佛这尊雕像本就是为表现缠绵交颈的姿态而雕琢！\n\n本笃会修士们的恐惧与惊愕难以言表。有人目睹这亵渎神明的异象后几欲奔逃，但奥古斯丁厉声喝止——当他看见恶魔新近的杰作时，宗教怒火令其面容如铁。他命人取来十字架、圣水帚与祝圣过的清水，以及下坑用的梯子，宣称必须将路易的遗体从邪恶痛苦的境地中解救出来。坑边的铁锤证明路易出发时心怀正义，但显然他最终屈服于神像的地狱诱惑。即便如此，教会绝不能将迷途的羔羊拱手让与邪魔。\n\n梯子运抵后，奥古斯丁亲自率三名最健硕勇敢的修士下坑，他们甘愿冒着灵魂堕落的危险来救赎路易。关于后续事件，传说略有出入。有版本称奥古斯丁向神像与受难者洒圣水时未见实效；另有说法称圣水触及横卧的维纳斯时化作地狱蒸汽，将路易的血肉熏得如同腐烂月余的尸骸，证明他已彻底沦入永罚。但所有传说都确认：三名壮硕修士遵照院长指示合力拉扯，却始终无法掰开女神环抱猎物的石臂。\n\n最终奥古斯丁下令用泥土与石块仓促填平坑穴。这片未留坟冢亦无标记的土地，很快与荒废花园一同湮没在蔓草杂芜之中。"

        "content": "\n\n\"Why must you always hurry away, my little one?\"\n\nThe voice of Mere Antoinette, the witch, was an amorous croaking. She ogled Pierre, the apothecary's young apprentice, with eyes full-orbed and unblinking as those of a toad. The folds beneath her chin swelled like the throat of some great batrachian. Her huge breasts, pale as frog-bellies, bulged from her torn gown as she leaned toward him.\n\nHe gave no answer; and she came closer, till he saw in the hollow of those breasts a moisture glistening like the dew of marshes... like the slime of some amphibian... a moisture that seemed always to linger there.\n\nHer voice, raucously coaxing, persisted. \"Stay awhile tonight, my pretty orphan. No one will miss you in the village. And your master will not mind.\" She pressed against him with shuddering folds of fat. With her short flat fingers, which gave almost the appearance of being webbed, she seized his hand and drew it to her bosom.\n\nPierre wrenched the hand away and drew back discreetly. Repelled, rather than abashed, he averted his eyes. The witch was more than twice his age, and her charms were too uncouth and unsavory to tempt him for an instant. Also, her repute was such as to have nullified the attractions of a younger and fairer sorceress. Her witchcraft had made her feared among the peasantry of that remote province, where belief in spells and philters was still common. The people of Averoigne called her La Mere des Crapauds, Mother of Toads, a name given for more than one reason. Toads swarmed innumerably about her hut; they were said to be her familiars, and dark tales were told concerning their relationship to the sorceress, and the duties they performed at her bidding. Such tales were all the more readily believed because of those batrachian features that had always been remarked in her aspect.\n\nThe youth disliked her, even as he disliked the sluggish, abnormally large toads on which he had sometimes trodden in the dusk, upon the path between her hut and the village of Les Hiboux. He could hear some of these creatures croaking now; and it seemed, weirdly, that they uttered half-articulate echoes of the witch's words.\n\nIt would be dark soon, he reflected. The path along the marshes was not pleasant by night, and he felt doubly anxious to depart. Still without replying to Mere Antionette's invitation, he reached for the black triangular vial she had set before him on her greasy table. The vial contained a philter of curious potency which his master, Alain le Dindon, had sent him to procure. Le Dindon,the village apothecary, was wont to deal surreptitiously in certain dubious medicaments supplied by the witch; and Pierre had often gone on such errands to her osier-hidden hut.\n\nThe old apothecary, whose humor was rough and ribald, had sometimes rallied Pierre concerning Mere Antoinette's preference for him. \"Some night, my lad, you will remain with her,\" he had said. \"Be careful, or the big toad will crush you.\" Remembering this gibe, the boy flushed angrily as he turned to go.\n\n\"Stay,\" insisted Mere Antoinette. \"The fog is cold on the marshes; and it thickens apace. I knew that you were coming, and I have mulled for you a goodly measure of the red wine of Ximes.\"\n\nShe removed the lid from an earthen pitcher and poured its steaming contents into a large cup. The purplish-red wine creamed delectably, and an odor of hot, delicious spices filled the hut, overpowering the less agreeable odors from the simmering cauldron, the half-dried newts, vipers, bat-wings and evil, nauseous herbs hanging on the walls, and the reek of the black candles of pitch and corpse-tallow that burned always, by noon or night, in that murky interior.\n\n\"I'll drink it,\" said Pierre, a little grudgingly. \"That is, if it contains nothing of your own concoction.\"\n\n\"'Tis naught but sound wine, four seasons old, with spices of Arabia,\" the sorceress croaked ingratiatingly. \"'Twill warm your stomach... and...\" She added something inaudible as Pierre accepted the cup.\n\nBefore drinking, he inhaled the fumes of the beverage with some caution but was reassured by its pleasant smell. Surely it was innocent of any drug, any philter brewed by the witch: for, to his knowledge, her preparations were all evil-smelling.\n\nStill, as if warned by some premonition, he hesitated. Then he remembered that the sunset air was indeed chill; that mists had gathered furtively behind him as he came to Mere Antoinette's dwelling. The wine would fortify him for the dismal return walk to Les Hiboux. He quaffed it quickly and. set down the cup. \"Truly, it is good wine,\" he declared. \"But I must go now.\"\n\nEven as he spoke, he felt in his stomach and veins the spreading warmth of the alcohol, of the spices... of something more ardent than these. It seemed that his voice was unreal and strange, falling as if from a height above him. the warmth grew, mounting within him like a golden flame fed by magic oils. His blood, a seething torrent,poured tumultuously and more tumultuously through his members.\n\nThere was a deep soft thundering in his ears, a rosy dazzlement in his eyes. Somehow the hut appeared to expand, to change luminously about him. He hardly recognized its squalid furnishings, its litter of baleful oddments, on which a torrid splendor was shed by the black candles, tipped with ruddy fire, that towered and swelled gigantically into the softgloom His blood burned as with the throbbing flame of the candles.\n\nIt came to him, for an instant, that all this was a questionable enchantment, a glamor wrought by the witch's wine. Fear was upon him and he wished to flee. Then, close beside him, he saw Mere Antoinette.\n\nBriefly he marvelled at the change that had befallen her. Then fear and wonder were alike forgotten, together with his old repulsion. He knew why the magic warmth mounted ever higher and hotter within him; why his flesh glowed like the ruddy tapers.\n\nThe soiled skirt she had worn lay at her feet, and she stood naked as Lilith, the first witch. The lumpish limbs and body had grown voluptuous; the pale, thick-lipped mouth enticed him with a promise of ampler kisses than other mouths couldyield. The pits of her short round arms, the concave of her ponderously drooping breasts, the heavy creases and swollen rondures of flanks and thighs, all were fraught with luxurious allurement.\n\n\"Do you like me now, my little one?\" she questioned.\n\nThis time he did not draw away but met her with hot, questing hands when she pressed heavily against him. Her limbs were cool and moist; her breasts yielded like the turf-mounds above a bog. Her body was white and wholly hairless; but here and there he found curious roughnesses... like those on the skin of a toad... that somehow sharpened his desire instead of repelling it.\n\nShe was so huge that his fingers barely joined behind her, His two hands, together, were equal only to the cupping of a single breast. But the wine had filled his blood with a philterous ardor.\n\nShe led him to her couch beside the hearth where a great cauldron boiled mysteriously, sending up its fumes in strange-twining coils that suggested vague and obscene figures. The couch was rude and bare. But the flesh of the sorceress was like deep, luxurious cushions...\n\nPIERRE AWOKE in the ashy dawn, when the tall black tapers had dwindled down and had melted limply in their sockets. Sick and confused, he sought vainly to remember where he was or what he had done. Then, turning a little, he saw beside him on the couch a thing that was like some impossible monster of ill dreams; a toadlike form, large as a fat woman. Its limbs were somehow like a woman's arms and legs. Its pale, warty body pressed and bulged against him, and he felt the rounded softness of something that resembled a breast.\n\nNausea rose within him as memory of that delirious night returned; Most foully he had been beguiled by the witch, and had succumbed to her evil enchantments.\n\nIt seemed that an incubus smothered him, weighing upon all his limbs and body. He shut his eyes, that he might no longer behold the loathsome thing that was Mere Antoinette in her true semblance. Slowly, with prodigious effort, he drew himself away from the crushing nightmare shape. It did not stir or appear to waken; and he slid quickly from the couch.\n\nAgain, compelled by a noisome fascination, he peered at the thing on the couch — and saw only the gross form of Mere Antoinette. Perhaps his impression of a great toad beside him had been but an illusion, a half-dream that lingered after slumber. He lost something of his nightmarish horror; but his gorge still rose in a sick disgust, remembering the lewdness to which he had yielded.\n\nFearing that the witch might awaken at any moment and seek to detain him, he stole noiselessly from the hut. It was broad daylight, but a cold, hueless mist lay everywhere, shrouding the reedy marshes, and hanging like a ghostly curtain on the path he must follow to Les Hiboux. Moving and seething always, the mist seemed to reach toward him with intercepting fingers as he started homeward. He shivered at its touch, he bowed his head and drew his cloak closer around him.\n\nThicker and thicker the mist swirled, coiling, writhing endlessly, as if to bar Pierre's progress. He could discern the twisting, narrow path for only a few paces in advance. It was hard to find the familiar landmarks, hard to recognize the osiers and willows that loomed suddenly before him like gray phantoms and faded again into the white nothingness as he went onward. Never had he seen such fog: it was like the blinding, stifling fumes of a thousand witch-stirred cauldrons.\n\nThough he was not altogether sure of his surroundings, Pierre thought that he had covered half the distance to the village. Then, all at once, he began to meet the toads. They were hidden by the mist till he came close upon them. Misshapen, unnaturally big and bloated, they squatted in his way on the little footpath or hopped sluggishly before him from the pallid gloom on either hand.\n\nSeveral struck against his feet with a horrible and heavy flopping. He stepped unaware upon one of them, and slipped in the squashy noisomeness it had made, barely saving himself from a headlong fall on the bog's rim. Black, miry water gloomed close beside him as he staggered there.\n\nTurning to regain his path, he crushed others of the toads to an abhorrent pulp under his feet. The marshy soil was alive with them. They flopped against him from the mist, striking his legs, his bosom, his very face with their clammy bodies. They rose up by scores like a devil-driven legion. It seemed that there was a malignance, an evil purpose in their movements, in the buffeting of their violent impact. He could make no progress on the swarming path, but lurched to and fro, slipping blindly, and shielding his face with lifted hands. He felt an eery consternation, an eldrich horror. It was as if the nightmare of his awakening in the witch's hut had somehow returned upon him.\n\nThe toads came always from the direction of Les Hiboux, as if to drive him back toward Mere Antoinette's dwelling. They bounded against him like a monstrous hail, like missiles flung by unseen demons. The ground was covered by them, the air was filled with their hurtling bodies. Once, he nearly went down beneath them.\n\nTheir number seemed to increase, they pelted him in a noxious storm. He gave way before them, his courage broke, and he started to run at random, without knowing that he had left the safe path. Losing.all thought of direction, in his frantic desire to escape from those impossible myriads, he plunged on amid the dim reeds and sedges, over ground that quivered gelatinously beneath him. Always at his heels he heard the soft, heavy flopping of the toads; and sometimes they rose up like a sudden wall to bar his way and turn him aside. More than once, they drove him back from the verge of hidden quagmires into which he would otherwise have gallen. It was as if they were herding him deliberately and concertedly to a destined goal.\n\nNow, like the lifting of a dense curtain, the mist rolled away, and Pierre saw before him in a golden dazzle of morning sunshine the green, thick-growing osiers that surrounded Mere Antoinette's hut. The toads had all disappeared, though he could have sworn that hundreds of them were hopping close about him an instant previously. With a feeling of helpless fright and panic, he knew that he was still within the witch's toils; that the toads were indeed her familiars, as so many people believed them to be. They had prevented his escape, and had broughthimback to the foul creature... whether woman, batrachian, or both... who was known as The Mother of Toads.\n\nPierre's sensations were those of one who sinks momently deeper into some black and bottomless quicksand. He saw the witch emerge from the hut and come toward him. Her thick fingers, with pale folds of skin between them like the beginnings of a web, were stretched and flattened on the steaming cup that she carried. A sudden gust of wind arose as if from nowhere, lifting the scanty skirts of Mere Antoinette about her fat thighs, and bearing to Pierre's nostrils the hot, familiar spices of the drugged wine.\n\n\"Why did you leave so hastily, my little one~\" There was an amorous wheedling in the very tone of the witch's question. \"I should not have let you go without another cup of the good red wine, mulled and spiced for the warming of your stomach... See, I have prepared it for you... knowing that you would return.\"\n\nShe came very close to him as she spoke, leering and sidling, and held the cup toward his lips. Pierre grew dizzy with the strange fumes and turned his head away. It seemed that a paralyzing spell had seized his muscles, for the simple movement required an immense effort.\n\nHis mind, however, was still clear, and the sick revulsion of that nightmare dawn returned upon him. He saw again the great toad that had lain at his side when he awakened.\n\n\"I will not drink your wine,\" he said firmly. \"You are a foul witch, and I loathe you. Let me go.\n\n\"Why do you loathe me?\" croaked Mere Antoinette. \"You loved me yesternight. I can give you all that other women give ... and more.\"\n\n\"You are not a woman,\" said Pierre. \"You are a big toad. I saw you in your true shape this morning. I'd rather drown in the marsh-waters than sleep with you again.\"\n\nAn indescribable change came upon the sorceress before Pierre had finished speaking. The leer slid from her thick and pallid features, leaving them blankly inhuman for an instant. Then her eyes bulged and goggled horribly, and her whole body appeared to swell as if inflated with venom.\n\n\"Go, then!\" she spat with a guttural virulence. \"But you will soon wish that you had stayed...\"\n\nThe queer paralysis had lifted from Pierre's muscles. It was as if the injunction of the angry witch had served to revoke an insidious, half-woven spell. With no parting glance or word, Pierre turned from her and fled with long, hasty steps, almost running, on the path to Les Hiboux.\n\nHe had gone little more than a hundred paces when the fog began to return. It coiled shoreward in vast volumes from the marshes, it poured like smoke from the very ground at his feet. Almost instantly, the sun dimmed to a wan silver disk and disappeared. The blue heavens were lost in the pale and seething voidness overhead. The path before Pierre was blotted out till he seemed to walk on the sheer rim of a white abyss, that moved with him as he went.\n\nLike the clammy arms of specters, with death-chill fingers that clutched and caressed, the weird mists drew closer still about Pierre. They thickened in his nostrils and throat, they dripped in a heavy dew from his garments. They choked him with the fetor of rank waters and putrescent ooze ... and a stench as of liquefying corpses that had risen somewhere to the surface amid the fen.\n\nThen, from the blank whiteness, the toads assailed Pierre in a surging, solid wave that towered above his head and swept him from the dim path with the force of falling seas as it descended. He went down, splashing and floundering, into water that swarmed with the numberless batrachians. Thick slime was in his mouth and nose as he struggled to regain his footing. The water, however, was only knee-deep, and the bottom, though slippery and oozy, supported him with little yielding when he stood erect.\n\nHe discerned indistinctly through the mist the nearby margin from which he had fallen. But his steps were weirdly and horribly hampered by the toad-seething waters when he strove to reach it. Inch by inch, with a hopeless panic deepening upon him, he fought toward the solid shore. The toads leaped and tumbled about him with a dizzying eddylike motion. They swirled like a viscid undertow around his feet and shins. They swept and swelled in great loathsome undulations against his retarded knees.\n\nHowever, he made slow and painful progress, till his outstretched fingers could almost grasp the wiry sedges that trailed from the low bank lhen, from that mist-bound shore, there fell and broke upon him a second deluge of those demoniac toads; and Pierre was bome helplessly backward into the filthy waters.\n\nHeld down by the piling and crawling masses, and drowning in nauseous darkness at the thick-oozed bottom, he clawed feebly at his assailants. For a moment, ere oblivion came, his fingers found among them the outlines of a monstrous form that was somehow toadlike... but large and heavy as a fat woman. At the last, it seemed to him that two enormous breasts were crushed closely down upon his face.",
        "content_cn": "\"我的小可爱，为何总是这般匆匆离去？\"\n\n梅尔·安托瓦内特——那个女巫——的声音带着情欲的嘶哑。她像蟾蜍般鼓着永不眨动的圆眼，直勾勾盯着药剂师年轻的学徒皮埃尔。她向前倾身时，下巴的赘肉如牛蛙喉囊般颤动，苍白如蛙腹的巨乳从破旧长袍里垂坠而出。\n\n少年沉默以对。她越靠越近，直到他看见那对乳房间闪烁着沼泽露水般的黏液...某种两栖生物特有的黏液...仿佛永远盘踞在那道沟壑里。\n\n\"今晚留下吧，漂亮的孤儿。\"沙哑的嗓音纠缠不休，\"村里没人会惦记你，你师父也不会介意。\"她颤抖的肥肉贴上来，短扁如蹼的手指抓住他的手腕按向自己胸口。\n\n皮埃尔猛地抽手后退。他转过脸去，眼中只有嫌恶而非羞赧。这女巫年纪足有他两倍大，粗鄙肉体散发的气息令人作呕。更何况当地人都唤她\"蟾母\"，这诨名绝非空穴来风——她茅屋周围永远聚集着成群的蟾蜍，据说都是供她驱使的魔宠。此刻那些生物正在暗处发出嘶鸣，诡异得像是应和着女巫的话语。\n\n暮色渐浓。皮埃尔伸手去取油腻木桌上的黑色三角瓶，里面装着师父需要的魔药。老药剂师常暗中交易这些可疑的药剂，还总拿女巫对他的垂涎打趣：\"小心哪天被那只大蛤蟆压扁。\"想起这些下流调侃，少年涨红着脸转身欲走。\n\n\"沼泽起雾了。\"女巫掀开陶罐，\"我特意为你热了希梅斯红酒。\"\n\n紫红色酒液泛起诱人泡沫，蒸腾的香料气息掩盖了屋内悬挂的蝾螈、毒蛇与蝙蝠翅膀的腥臭。皮埃尔谨慎地嗅了嗅——以他所知，女巫的魔药都该有刺鼻气味才对。\n\n\"真是好酒。\"他一饮而尽，\"但我该走了。\"\n\n酒精的暖意刚在血管里扩散，异变陡生。茅屋在他眼前膨胀扭曲，黑蜡烛的火焰蹿成巨柱。女巫的破裙滑落脚下，此刻她赤裸如传说中的魔女莉莉丝。臃肿的肢体变得丰腴诱人，苍白厚唇许诺着销魂热吻。当他发现她皮肤上蟾蜍般的颗粒时，竟感到更强烈的渴望。\n\n\"现在喜欢我了吗？\"她问。\n\n这次他没有退缩。她的肢体冰凉湿润，乳房像沼泽上的草丘般柔软。他们倒向炉边那张简陋的床榻，而女巫的肉体成了最奢华的软垫......\n\n灰白晨光中，皮埃尔在干涸的蜡油旁惊醒。身旁蜷缩着噩梦般的怪物——蟾蜍般的躯体却有女人的四肢，苍白疣粒的皮肤紧贴着他。昨夜癫狂的记忆涌来，他强忍呕吐的冲动挣脱这具躯体。\n\n晨雾如亡灵帷幕笼罩着芦苇荡。皮埃尔裹紧斗篷前行时，白雾里突然跳出畸形硕大的蟾蜍。它们蹲伏在小径上，迟缓地在他面前跳跃。雾气越来越浓，最终化作千口魔釜蒸腾的毒瘴，彻底吞没了通往莱西布村的道路。\n\n几只可憎的蟾蜍重重地拍打在他的脚面上。他不慎踩中其中一只，在黏腻恶心的浆液中滑倒，险些栽进沼泽边缘的黑色泥潭。当他踉跄站稳时，腐臭的泥水正在身旁幽幽发亮。\n\n他转身寻找来路，却将更多蟾蜍踩成令人作呕的肉泥。潮湿的土壤里蠕动着无数活物。这些黏滑的生物从雾霭中扑来，撞击他的双腿、胸膛乃至面颊。它们如恶魔驱使的军团般成片跃起，每一次撞击都带着恶毒的意图。在这条爬满活物的路径上，他寸步难行，只能盲目地踉跄躲闪，高举双手护住面孔。某种诡异的惊惶攫住了他——仿佛在女巫小屋醒来的噩梦再度降临。\n\n蟾蜍始终来自莱西布方向，似要将他逼回安托瓦内特老妪的住所。它们像冰雹般砸来，如同隐形恶魔投掷的弹丸。地面布满这些生物，空中飞舞着它们肥硕的躯体。有几次他几乎被撞倒在地。\n\n它们的数量不断增殖，形成一场恶毒的暴风雨。他的勇气终于崩溃，开始漫无目的地奔逃，浑然不觉已偏离安全路径。在逃离这恐怖蟾群的疯狂冲动中，他彻底迷失方向，冲进朦胧的芦苇丛，脚下凝胶状的土壤不住震颤。黏腻的拍打声始终尾随其后，有时它们会突然筑起肉墙截断去路。多次将他从隐蔽的泥潭边缘驱回——这些生物仿佛正有预谋地将他赶向某个既定终点。\n\n浓雾如帷幕般突然升起。晨光中，皮埃尔看见安托瓦内特小屋周围茂密的柳丛泛着金绿色光芒。蟾群已消失无踪，尽管他确信片刻前仍有数百只环绕身侧。一种无助的恐惧攫住他：自己仍陷于女巫的罗网，那些蟾蜍确如传闻所言是她的使魔。它们阻止了他的逃亡，将他带回这个污秽存在——不知是女人、蟾蜍还是两者结合体——被称作\"蟾之母\"的生物身边。\n\n皮埃尔的感觉如同沉入无底流沙。女巫从小屋现身走来，苍白指间带着蹼膜的双手捧着热气腾腾的杯子。一阵怪风突然掀起她单薄的裙摆，将药酒刺鼻的香料味送入他鼻腔。\n\n\"为何匆匆离去，我的小可爱？\"女巫的语调带着淫邪的诱哄，\"我该让你再饮一杯暖胃的香料红酒...瞧，我早为你备好了...就知道你会回来。\"\n\n她贴近他，斜眼睨视着递来酒杯。诡异的酒气令皮埃尔头晕目眩，他别过脸去。某种麻痹咒似乎控制了他的肌肉，这个简单动作竟需耗费巨力。\n\n但他的神智依然清醒，黎明时分的噩梦记忆涌上心头。他又看见醒来时身旁那只巨型蟾蜍。\n\n\"我不喝你的酒，\"他厉声道，\"你这污秽的女巫，我厌恶你。放我走。\"\n\n\"为何厌恶我？\"安托瓦内特嘶声道，\"昨夜你分明爱我。我能给你寻常女人给的一切...还有更多。\"\n\n\"你不是女人，\"皮埃尔说，\"是只巨蟾。今晨我见过你真容。宁可溺死沼泽也不愿再碰你。\"\n\n未等他说完，女巫面容已发生骇人变化。淫笑从她浮肿的脸上褪去，瞬间显露出非人的空白。接着眼球可怕地暴突，整个躯体如充气般膨胀。\n\n\"滚吧！\"她喉间迸出恶毒的嘶吼，\"但你很快就会后悔...\"\n\n诡异的麻痹感突然从皮埃尔肌肉中消退，仿佛女巫的怒斥解除了未完成的咒语。他头也不回地冲向莱西布的小路，几乎狂奔起来。\n\n刚跑出百步远，浓雾再度降临。沼泽中升起的灰白烟瘴如活物般缠绕着他，顷刻间太阳便化作惨白圆盘消失无踪。蓝天被翻涌的虚无吞噬，小路在他脚下化作移动的白色深渊边缘。\n\n雾气如幽灵黏腻的手臂缠绕皮埃尔，死亡般冰冷的手指抚过他的咽喉。腐水与烂泥的恶臭灌入他的口鼻，衣袍上凝结着沉重的露珠...其间还混杂着某种似从沼泽深处浮起的尸解气息。\n\n突然，白色虚空中掀起滔天蟾浪，高过他的头顶，以海啸之势将他拍离小径。他跌进满是蟾蜍的水中挣扎，黏浆灌进鼻腔。好在水深仅及膝，虽然底部滑腻，站立时尚能勉强支撑。\n\n透过雾气，他隐约辨出跌落处的岸沿。但试图返回时，蟾群翻涌的水域诡异阻滞着他的步伐。他绝望地与恐慌搏斗，一寸寸挪向坚实地面。蟾蜍形成令人眩晕的漩涡环绕着他，黏稠的暗流冲刷小腿，恶心的浪涛不断冲击膝盖。\n\n当他的指尖几乎够到岸边垂落的莎草时，第二波恶魔蟾群从雾中倾泻而下。皮埃尔再次无助地倒灌进污水中。\n\n无数爬行生物将他压向散发着恶臭的淤泥底部。在陷入黑暗前，他的手指触碰到某个蟾形巨物...其肥硕程度堪比胖妇人。最终时刻，他感觉两团巨大的乳房紧紧压住了他的面孔。"

        "content": "\n\nSabmon the anchorite was famed no less for his piety than for his prophetic wisdom and knowledge of the dark art of sorcery. He had dwelt alone for two generations in a curious house on the rim of the northern desert of Tasuun: a house whose floor and walls were built from the large bones of dromedaries, and whose roof was a wattling composed of the smaller bones of wild dogs and men and hyenas. These ossuary relics, chosen for their whiteness and symmetry, were bound securely together with well-tanned thongs, and were joined and fitted with marvelous closeness, leaving no space for the blown sand to penetrate. This house was the pride of Sabmon, who swept it daily with a besom of mummy's hair, till it shone immaculate as polished ivory both within and without.\n\nDespite his remoteness and reclusion, and the hardships that attended a journey to his abode, Sabmon was much consulted by the people of Tasuun, and was even sought by pilgrims from the farther shores of Zothique. However, though not ungracious or inhospitable, he often ignored the queries of his visitors, who, as a rule, wished merely to divine the future or to ask advice concerning the most advantageous government of their affairs. He became more and more taciturn with age, and spoke little with men in his last years. It was said, perhaps not untruly, that he preferred to talk with the murmuring palms about his well, or the wandering stars that went over his hermitage.\n\nIn the summer of Sabmon's ninety-third year, there came to him the youth Amalzain, his great-nephew, and the son of a niece that Sabmon had loved dearly in days before his retirement to a gymnosophic seclusion. Amalzain, who had spent all of his one-and-twenty years in the upland home of his parents, was on his way to Miraab, the capital of Tasuun, where he would serve as a cup-bearer to Famorgh the king. This post, obtained for him by influential friends of his father, was much coveted among the youth of the land, and would lead to high advancement if he were fortunate enough to win the king's favor. In accord with his mother's wish, he had come to visit Sabmon and to ask the counsel of the sage regarding various problems of worldly conduct.\n\nSabmon, whose eyes were undimmed by age and astronomy and much poring over volumes of archaic ciphers, was pleased with Amalzain and found in the boy something of his mother's beauty. And for this reason he gave freely of his hoarded wisdom; and, after uttering many profound and pertinent maxims, he said to Amalzain:\n\n\"It is indeed well that you have come to me: for, innocent of the world's turpitude, you fare to a city of strange sins and strange witcheries and sorceries. There are numerous evils in Miraab. Its women are witches and harlots, and their beauty is a foulness wherein the young, the strong, the valiant, are limed and taken.\"\n\nThen, ere Amalzain departed, Sabmon gave to him a small amulet of silver, graven curiously with the migniard skeleton of a girl. And Sabmon said:\n\n\"I counsel you to wear this amulet at all times henceforward. It contains a pinch of ashes from the pyre of Yos Ebni, sage and archimage, who won supremacy over men and demons in elder years by defying all mortal temptation and putting down the insubordination of the flesh. There is a virtue in these ashes, and they will protect you from such evils as were overcome by Yos Ebni. And yet, peradventure, there are ills and enchantments in Miraab from which the amulet can not defend you. In such case you must return to me. I shall watch over you carefully, and shall know all that occurs to you in Miraab: for I have long since become the owner of certain rare faculties of sight and hearing whose exercise is not debarred or limited by mere distance.\"\n\nAmalzain, being ignorant of the matters at which Sabmon hinted, was somewhat bewildered by this peroration. But he received the amulet gratefully. Then, bidding Sabmon a reverential farewell, he resumed his journey to Miraab, wondering much as to the fortune that would befall him in that sinful and many-legended city.\n\nFamorgh, who had grown old and senile amid his debaucheries, was the ruler of an aging, semi-desert land; and his court was a place of farsought luxury, of obliquitous refinement and corruption. The youth Amalzain, accustomed only to the simple manners, the rude virtues and vices of country-dwelling folk, was dazzled at first by the sybaritic life around him. But a certain innate strength of character, fortified by the moral teachings of his parents and the precepts of his great-uncle, Sabmon, preserved him from any grave errors or lapses.\n\nThus it was that he served as a cup-bearer at bachannalian revels, but remained abstemious throughout, pouring night after night in the ruby-crusted cup of Famorgh the maddening wines that were drugged with cannabis and the stupefying arrack with its infusion of poppy. With untainted heart and flesh he beheld the infamous mummeries whereby the courtiers, vying with each other in shamelessness, attempted to lighten the king's ennui. Feeling only wonder or disgust, he watched the nimble and lascivious contortions of black dancers from Dooza Thom in the north, or saffron-bodied girls from the southern isles. His parents, who believed implicitly in the superhuman goodness of monarchs, had not prepared him for this spectacle of royal vice; but the reverence they had instilled so thoroughly into Amalzain led him to regard it all as being the peculiar but mysterious prerogative of the kings of Tasuun.\n\nDuring his first month in Miraab, Amalzain heard much of the Princess Ulua, sole daughter of Famorgh and Queen Lunalia; but since the women of the royal family seldom attended the banquets or appeared in public, he did not see her. The huge and shadowy palace, however, was filled with whispers concerning her amours. Ulua, he was told, had inherited the sorceries of her mother Lunalia, whose dark, luxurious beauty, so often sung by bewitched poets, was now fallen to a haggish decrepitude. The lovers of Ulua were innumerable, and she often procured their passion or insured their fidelity by other charms than those of her person. Though little taller than a child, she was exquisitely formed and endowed with the loveliness of some female demon that might haunt the slumbers of youth. She was feared by many and her ill will was deemed a dangerous thing. Famorgh, no less blind to her sins and witcheries than he had been to those of Lunalia, indulged her in all ways and denied her nothing.\n\nAmalzain's duties left him much idle time, for Famorgh usually slept the double sleep of age and intoxication after the evening revels. Much of this time he gave to the study of algebra and the reading of olden poems and romances. One morning, while he was engaged with certain algebraic calculations, there came to Amalzain a huge negress who had been pointed out to him as one of Ulua's waiting-women. She told him peremptorily that he was to follow her to the apartments of Ulua. Bewildered and amazed by this singular interruption of his studies, he was unable to reply for a moment. Thereupon, seeing his hesitation, the great black woman lifted him in her naked arms and carried him easily from the room and through the palace halls. Angry, and full of discomfiture, he found himself deposited in a chamber hung with shameless designs, where, amid the fuming of aphrodisiac vapors, the princess regarded him with luxurious gravity from a couch of fire-bright scarlet. She was small as a woman of the elf-folk, and voluptuous as a coiled lamia. The incense floated about her like sinuous veils.\n\n\"There are other things than the pouring of wine for a sottish monarch, or the study of worm-eaten volumes,\" said Ulua in a voice that was like the flowing of hot honey. \"Sir cup-bearer, your youth should have a better employment than these.\"\n\n\"I ask no employment, other than my duties and studies,\" replied Amalzain ungraciously. \"But tell me, O princess, what is your will? Why has your serving-woman brought me here in a fashion so unseemly?\"\n\n\"For a youth so erudite and clever, the question should be needless,\" answered Ulua, smiling obliquely. \"See you not that I am beautiful and desirable? Or can it be that your perceptions are duller than I had thought?\"\n\n\"I do not doubt that you are beautiful,\" said the boy, \"but such matters hardly concern a humble cup-bearer.\"\n\nThe vapors, mounting thickly from golden thuribles before the couch, were parted with a motion as of drawn draperies; and Amalzain lowered his gaze before the enchantress, who shook with a soft laughter that made the jewels upon her bosom twinkle like living eyes.\n\n\"It would seem that those musty volumes have indeed blinded you,\" she told him. \"You have need of that euphrasy which purges the sight. Go now: but return presently—of your own accord.\"\n\nFor many days thereafter, Amalzain, going about his duties as usual, was aware of a strange haunting. It seemed now that Ulua was everywhere. Appearing at the revels, as if by some new caprice, she flaunted her evil beauty in the eyes of the young cup-bearer; and often, by day, he met her in the palace gardens and corridors. All men spoke of her, as if conspiring tacitly to keep her in his thoughts; and it seemed that even the heavy arrases whispered her name as they rustled in the lost winds that wandered through the gloomy and interminable halls.\n\nThis, however, was not all: for her undesired image began to trouble his nightly dreams; and awakening, he heard the warm dulcet languor of her voice, and felt the caress of light and subtle fingers in the darkness. Peering at the pale moon that waxed beyond the windows, above the black cypresses, he saw her dead, corroded face assume the living features of Ulua. The lithe and migniard form of the young witch appeared to move among the fabulous queens and goddesses that thronged the opulent hangings with their amours. Beheld as if through enchantment, her face leaned beside his in the mirrors; and she came and vanished, phantom-like, with seductive murmurs and wanton gestures, as he bent over his books. But though he was perturbed by these appearances, in which he could scarce distinguish the real from the illusory, Amalzain was still indifferent toward Ulua, being surely protected from her charms by the amulet containing the ashes of Yos Ebni, saint and sage and archimage. From certain curious flavors detected more than once in his food and drink, he suspected that the love-potions for which she had become infamous were being administered to him; but beyond a light and passing qualmishness, he experienced no ill effect whatever; and he was wholly ignorant of the spells woven against him in secret, and the thrice-lethal invultuations that were designed to wound his heart and senses.\n\nNow (though he knew it not) his indifference was a matter of much gossip at the court. Men marvelled greatly at such exemption: for all whom the princess had chosen heretofore, whether captains, cup-bearers or high dignitaries, or common soldiers and grooms, had yielded easily to her bewitchments. So it came to pass that Ulua was angered, since all men knew that her beauty was scorned by Amalzain, and her sorcery was impotent to ensnare him. Thereupon she ceased to appear at the revels of Famorgh; and Amalzain beheld her no longer in the halls and gardens; and neither his dreams nor his waking hours were haunted any more by the spell-wrought semblance of Ulua. So, in his innocence, he rejoiced as one who has encountered a grave peril and has come forth unharmed.\n\nThen, later, on a moonless night, as he lay sleeping tranquilly in the moonless hours before dawn, there came to him in his dream a figure muffled from crown to heel with the vestments of the tomb. Tall as a caryatid, awful and menacing, it leaned above him in silence more malignant than any curse; and the cerements fell open at the breast, and charnel-worms and death-scarabs and scorpions, together with shreds of rotting flesh, rained down upon Amalzain. Then, as he awoke from his nightmare, sick and stifled, he breathed a carrion fetor, and felt against him the pressure of a still, heavy body. Affrighted, he rose and lit the lamp; but the bed was empty. Yet the odor of putrefaction still lingered; and Amalzain could have sworn that the corpse of a woman, two weeks dead and teeming with maggots, had laid closely at his side in the darkness.\n\nThereafter, for many nights, his slumbers were broken by such foulnesses as this. Hardly could he sleep at all for the horror of that which came and went, invisible but palpable, in his chamber. Always he awoke from ill dreams, to find about him the stiffened arms of long-dead succubi, or to feel at his side the amorous trembling of fleshless skeletons. He was choked by the natron and bitumen of mummied breasts; he was crushed by the unremoving weight of gigantic liches; he was kissed nauseously by lips that were oozing tatters of corruption.\n\nNor was this all; for other abominations came to him by day, visible and perceived through all his senses, and more loathsome even than the dead. Things that seemed as the leavings of leprosy crawled before him at high noon in the halls of Famorgh; and they rose up from the shadows and sidled toward him, leering whitely with faces that were no longer faces, and trying to caress him with their half-eaten fingers. About his ankles, as he went to and fro, there clung lascivious empusae with breasts that were furred like the bat; and serpent-bodied lamiae minched and pirouetted before his eyes, like the dancers before the king.\n\nNo longer could he read his books or solve his problems of algebra in peace: for the letters changed from moment to moment beneath his scrutiny and were twisted into runes of evil meaning; and the signs and ciphers he had written were turned into devils no bigger than large emmets, that writhed foully across the paper as if on a field, performing those rites which are acceptable only to Alila, queen of perdition and goddess of all iniquities.\n\nThus plagued and bedevilled, the youth Amalzain was near to madness; yet he dared not complain or speak to others of aught that he beheld; for he knew that these horrors, whether immaterial or substantial, were perceived only by himself. Nightly, for the full period of a moon, he lay with dead things in his chamber; and daily, in all his comings and goings, he was besought by abhorrent specters. And he doubted not that all these were the sendings of Ulua, angered by his refusal of her love; and he remembered that Sabmon had hinted darkly of certain enchantments from which the ashes of Yes Ebni, preserved in the silver amulet, might be powerless to defend him. And, knowing that such enchantments were upon him now, he recalled the final injunction of the old archimage.\n\nSo, feeling that there was no help for him save in the wizardry of Sabmon, he went before King Famorgh and begged a short leave of absence from the court. And Famorgh, who was well pleased with the cup-bearer, and moreover had begun to note his thinness and pallor, granted the request readily.\n\nMounted on a palfrey chosen for speed and endurance, Amalzain rode northward from Miraab on a sultry morning in autumn. A strange heaviness had stilled all the air; and great coppery clouds were piled like towering, many-domed palaces of genii on the desert hills. The sun appeared to swim in molten brass. No vultures flew on the silent heavens; and the very jackals had retired to their lairs, as if in fear of some unknown doom. But Amalzain, riding swiftly toward Sabmon's hermitage, was haunted still by leprous larvae that rose before him, posturing foully on the dun sands; and he heard the desirous moaning of succubi under the hooves of his horse.\n\nThe night waylaid him, airless and starless, as he came to a well amid dying palms. Here he lay sleepless, with the curse of Ulua still upon him: for it seemed that the dry, dusty liches of desert tombs reclined rigidly at his side; and bony fingers wooed him toward the unfathomable sand-pits from which they had risen.\n\nWeary and devil-ridden, he reached the wattled house of Sabmon at noon of the next day. The sage greeted him affectionately, showing no surprise, and listened to his story with the air of one who harkens a twice-told tale.\n\n\"These things, and more, were known to me from the beginning,\" he said to Amalzain. \"I could have saved you from the sendings of Ulua ere now; but it was my wish that you should come to me at this time, forsaking the court of the dotard Famorgh and the evil city of Miraab, whose iniquities are now at the full. The imminent doom of Miraab, though unread by her astrologers, has been declared in the heavens; and I would not that you should share the doom.\"\n\n\"It is needful,\" he went on, \"that the spells of Ulua should be broken on this very day, and the sendings returned to her that sent them; since otherwise they would haunt you for ever, remaining as a visible and tangible plague when the witch herself has gone to her black lord, Thasaidon, in the seventh hell.\"\n\nThen, to the wonderment of Amalzain, the old magician brought forth from a cabinet of ivory an elliptic mirror of dark and burnished metal and placed it before him. The mirror was held aloft by the muffled hands of a veiled image; and peering within it, Amalzain saw neither his own face nor the face of Sabmon, nor aught of the room itself reflected. And Sabmon enjoined him to watch the mirror closely, and then repaired to a small oratory that was curtained from the chamber with long and queerly painted rolls of camel-parchment.\n\nWatching the mirror, Amalzain was aware that certain of the sendings of Ulua came and went beside him, striving ever to gain his attention with unclean gestures such as harlots use. But resolutely he fixed his eyes on the void and unreflecting metal; and anon he heard the voice of Sabmon chanting without pause the powerful words of an antique formula of exorcism; and now from between the oratory curtains there issued the intolerable pungency of burning spices, such as are employed to drive away demons.\n\nThen Amalzain perceived, without lifting his eyes from the mirror, that the sendings of Ulua had vanished like vapors blown away by the desert wind. But in the mirror a scene limned itself darkly, and he seemed to look on the marble towers of the city of Miraab beneath overlooming bastions of ominous cloud. Then the scene shifted, and he saw the palace hall where Famorgh nodded in wine-stained purple, senile and drunken, amid his ministers and sycophants. Again the mirror changed, and he beheld a room with tapestries of shameless design, where, on a couch of fire-bright crimson, the Princess Ulua sat with her latest lovers amid the fuming of golden thuribles.\n\nMarvelling as he peered within the mirror, Amalzain witnessed a strange thing; for the vapors of the thuribles, mounting thickly and voluminously, took from instant to instant the form of those very apparitions by which he had been bedevilled so long. Ever they rose and multiplied, till the chamber teemed with the spawn of hell and the vomitings of the riven charnel. Between Ulua and the lover at her right hand, who was a captain of the king's guard, there coiled a monstrous lamia, enfolding them both in its serpentine volumes and crushing them with its human bosom; and close at her left hand appeared a half-eaten corpse, leering with lipless teeth, from whose cerements worms were sifted upon Ulua and her second lover, who was a royal equerry. And, swelling like the fumes of some witches' vat, those other abominations pressed about the couch of Ulua with obscene mouthings and fingerings.\n\nAt this, like the mark of a hellish branding, horror was printed on the features of the captain and the equerry; and a terror rose in the eyes of Ulua like a pale flame ignited in sunless pits; and her breasts shuddered beneath the breast-cups. And now, in a trice, the mirrored room began to rock violently, and the censers were overturned on the tilting flags, and the shameless hangings shook and bellied like the blown sails of a vessel in storm. Great cracks appeared in the floor, and beside the couch of Ulua a chasm deepened swiftly and then widened from wall towall. The whole chamber was riven asunder, and the princess and her two lovers, with all her loathly sendings about them, were hurled tumultuously into the chasm.\n\nAfter that, the mirror darkened, and Amalzain beheld for a moment the pale towers of Miraab, tossing and falling on heavens black as adamant. The mirror itself trembled, and the veiled image of metal supporting it began to totter and seemed about to fall; and the wattled house of Sabmon shook in the passing earthquake, but, being stoutly built, stood firm while the mansions and palaces of Miraab went down in ruin.\n\nWhen the earth had ceased its long trembling, Sabmon issued from the oratory.\n\n\"It is needless to moralize on what has happened,\" he said. \"You have learned the true nature of carnal desire, and have likewise beheld the history of mundane corruption. Now, being wise, you will turn early to those things which are incorruptible and beyond the world.\"\n\nThereafter, till the death of Sabmon, Amalzain dwelt with him and became his only pupil in the science of the stars and the hidden arts of enchantment and sorcery.\n\nPrinted from: www.eldritchdark.com/writings/short-stories/248\n\nPrinted on: January 11, 2011",
        "content_cn": "隐士萨布蒙因其虔诚与预言智慧而闻名，更以精通黑暗巫术著称。他在塔苏恩北部沙漠边缘那座奇特的房屋中独居了两代人——那房屋的墙壁与地板全由单峰驼的巨大骸骨搭建，屋顶则用野狗、人类与鬣狗的细小骨骼编织而成。这些因洁白对称而被选中的骨殖遗物，用鞣制皮革牢牢捆扎，以不可思议的精密工艺拼接，连一粒流沙都无法渗入。萨布蒙每日用木乃伊发丝制成的扫帚清扫，使这骨屋内外皆如象牙般光洁无瑕，成为他引以为傲的居所。\n\n尽管隐居荒僻、访客需历经艰险，塔苏恩民众仍常来求教萨布蒙，甚至佐西克远岸的朝圣者也慕名而至。这位隐士虽非刻薄之人，却往往对占卜未来或世俗事务的咨询置若罔闻。随着年岁增长，他愈发沉默寡言，晚年几乎不与凡人交谈。据说他更愿与井边絮语的棕榈，或是掠过隐居处的游荡星辰对话——这传闻或许并非虚言。\n\n萨布蒙九十三岁那年夏天，他的侄孙阿马尔赞前来拜访。这位二十一岁的青年自幼生长在父母的高地家园，正要前往塔苏恩都城米拉阿布，担任法莫尔格国王的持杯侍从。这职位由父亲的有力友人谋得，是王国青年梦寐以求的晋身之阶。遵从母亲意愿，阿马尔赞前来寻求智者关于处世之道的建议。\n\n萨布蒙那双未被岁月、星象与古卷密码侵蚀的眼睛，在青年身上看到了亡妹的影子。他破例倾囊相授，在阐述诸多深邃箴言后说道：\n\n\"你来得正是时候。纯真如你，将踏入充满诡异罪孽与巫术的都城。米拉阿布充斥着邪恶——那里的女人皆是巫妓，其美貌犹如腐沼，诱捕着年轻力壮的勇者。\"\n\n临行前，萨布蒙赠予他一枚雕刻着少女纤骨的银制护符：\"务必时刻佩戴。其中封存着大贤者约斯·埃布尼的骨灰，这位圣徒曾以禁欲苦修降服人魔。但米拉阿布有些邪祟非此物能御，届时你必须归来。我能洞悉你在都城的一切遭遇。\"\n\n懵懂的阿马尔赞恭敬告别，带着护符踏上旅程，对这座罪恶之都的命运既期待又忐忑。\n\n沉湎酒色的法莫尔格统治着日渐衰败的荒漠王国，其宫廷充斥着穷奢极欲的堕落风气。来自乡野的阿马尔赞初时目眩神迷，但父母教诲与萨布蒙的箴言使他坚守本心。他在酒神祭般的宴席中持壶侍酒，却始终滴酒不沾，夜夜为国王斟满掺了大麻的狂乱葡萄酒与罂粟浸泡的迷魂亚力酒。他冷眼旁观群臣以不堪入目的表演取悦国王，无论是北方杜萨·索姆黑人舞者的淫媚扭动，还是南方群岛黄肤少女的放浪姿态，只令他感到惊诧与厌恶。父母对王权神圣性的灌输，使他将这一切视为塔苏恩君王神秘特权。\n\n在米拉阿布的首月，阿马尔赞听闻了许多关于乌鲁阿公主的传闻——她是法莫尔格与王后卢娜莉亚的独女，继承了母亲的黑巫术。虽然鲜少露面，但宫中处处流传着她的风流韵事。据说这位身材娇小如精灵的公主，拥有令青年梦魇的魔性美貌，能用法术维系情人的忠诚。法莫尔格对她的恶行视若无睹，一如当年纵容卢娜莉亚。\n\n某日清晨，当阿马尔赞研习代数时，乌鲁阿的黑人侍女突然闯入，不由分说将他挟至公主香闺。在催情熏香缭绕的绯红锦榻上，娇小如蛇妖的公主慵懒注视着他：\"比起侍奉醉醺醺的国王，或钻研虫蛀典籍，你青春年华理应有更好的消遣。\"阿马尔赞生硬回绝后，公主却笑得胸前珠宝如活物般闪烁：\"看来那些发霉典籍确实蒙蔽了你。去吧——但愿你自愿归来。\"\n\n此后日子里，阿马尔赞感到乌鲁阿如影随形。她突然频繁现身宴会，在宫廷走廊\"偶遇\"，甚至侵入他的梦境。月光下柏树的黑影会幻化成她腐蚀的面容，挂毯上的神话女王突然化作她的身姿。镜中浮现她贴近的脸庞，读书时耳边响起她挑逗的絮语。所幸约斯·埃布尼的护符使他始终无动于衷。\n\n这种罕见的抗拒引发了宫廷议论。当乌鲁阿得知自己的魅力与巫术竟双双失效，愤而不再公开露面。天真的阿马尔赞以为危机已过，殊不知真正的恐怖才刚开始。\n\n某个无月之夜，裹尸布般的梦魇降临。一具高如女像柱的腐尸向他倾泻蛆虫与死亡甲虫。惊醒时他闻到腐肉恶臭，感到一具肿胀女尸紧贴身旁。点灯后虽空无一物，但尸臭经久不散。\n\n此后夜夜如此。他总在噩梦中惊醒，发现被枯骨手臂缠绕，或遭木乃伊的沥青乳房窒息。白昼的恐怖更甚：正午走廊会爬出麻风病般的活尸，阴影里探出残缺手指的爱抚；脚边萦绕着蝙蝠乳房的淫魔，眼前扭动着蛇身女妖的艳舞。代数符号在他笔下扭曲成恶魔文字，纸页上爬满举行邪祭的微小魔鬼。\n\n饱受折磨的阿马尔赞濒临疯狂，却不敢向人倾诉这些唯有自己能见的可怖幻象。他确信这是遭拒的乌鲁阿降下的诅咒，想起萨布蒙关于\"护符无法抵御某些邪术\"的警示，终于向法莫尔格告假离去。\n\n离宫那日，秋空凝滞如铅，铜色云层堆积如魔神宫殿。没有秃鹫敢掠过这诡异的苍穹，连豺狼都躲回巢穴。但阿马尔赞仍看见麻风鬼魅在沙丘摆出淫姿，马蹄下传来魅魔的呻吟。当夜在枯棕榈间的井边露宿时，干尸的骨手仍试图将他拖入流沙深渊。\n\n次日正午，精疲力竭的青年终于抵达萨布蒙的骨屋。智者毫不意外地亲切相迎，倾听叙述时仿佛早已知晓这所有苦难。\n\n\"这些事，以及更多，我自始便知晓，\"他对阿玛尔赞说道，\"我本可早些将你从乌露阿的诅咒中解救出来；但我希望你此刻能舍弃昏聩法莫格的宫廷与罪恶之城米拉布——那座城邦的堕落已达极致——前来寻我。米拉布迫近的厄运虽未被其占星师所窥见，却早已在天象中昭示；我不愿你与那厄运同归于尽。\"\n\n\"必须如此，\"他继续道，\"乌露阿的咒术须于今日破除，那些被遣出的邪祟将归返其主；否则即便那女巫本人已堕入第七层地狱侍奉其黑暗之主塔萨伊顿，它们仍会永远纠缠着你，化作可见可触的灾殃。\"\n\n接着，令阿玛尔赞惊异的是，老法师从象牙橱柜中取出一面椭圆形的暗色抛光金属镜置于面前。镜子被一尊蒙面雕像的缠裹双手高举着；阿玛尔赞向镜中望去，却既未见自己的面容，亦未见萨布蒙的面容，房中景象更无丝毫映照。萨布蒙命他紧盯镜面，随即退入一间被绘有奇异图案的驼皮纸长卷遮掩的小型祈祷室。\n\n凝视镜面时，阿玛尔赞察觉到乌露阿遣出的某些邪祟在他身旁忽隐忽现，不断以娼妓般的淫秽姿态试图攫取他的注意。但他坚定地将目光锁定在那片虚无的、映照不出任何事物的金属上；不久他听见萨布蒙的声音持续吟诵着古老驱魔咒文的强大词句；此刻祈祷室的帷幔间飘出驱魔香料燃烧时难以忍受的刺鼻气息。\n\n阿玛尔赞未移开视线便察觉到，乌露阿的邪祟已如被沙漠之风驱散的雾气般消失无踪。但镜中渐渐浮现出一幅幽暗景象，他仿佛看见米拉布城的大理石城垛在险恶云垒的笼罩之下。随后景象变换，他望见法莫格在群臣与谄媚者间身着酒渍紫袍点头打盹，衰老而醺醉。镜子再度变化，他窥见一间悬挂着淫邪挂毯的密室，乌露阿公主与她的新欢们端坐在火红绯色长榻上，周身缭绕着黄金香炉的烟雾。\n\n当阿玛尔赞惊诧地凝视镜中时，他目睹了诡异之事：香炉升腾的浓密烟雾，竟瞬息化作长久折磨他的那些可怖幻影。它们不断增殖，直至整个房间充斥着地狱孽种与裂墓秽物。一条可怖的拉弥亚缠绕在乌露阿与她右侧的国王卫队长之间，蛇形身躯将二人绞缠，人类般的胸脯挤压着他们；她左手边则浮现一具被啃噬过半的尸体，无唇的牙齿森然狞笑，尸衣中蠕动的蛆虫纷纷落在乌露阿与她的第二情夫——一位皇家马厩长——身上。其他秽恶之物如女巫大锅蒸腾的浊气般膨胀，以淫邪的舔舐与抓挠围逼着乌露阿的卧榻。\n\n此刻，如同地狱烙铁留下的印记，恐惧刻进了卫队长与马厩长的面容；乌露阿眼中腾起的惊惶犹如无光深坑中点燃的苍白火焰；她的胸脯在杯状胸衣下剧烈颤抖。转瞬间，镜中房间开始猛烈摇晃，香炉在倾斜的石板上翻倒，淫秽挂毯如暴风雨中的船帆般鼓胀飘荡。地板上裂开巨缝，乌露阿卧榻旁的裂隙急速加深，随即贯穿整面墙壁。整个房间轰然崩塌，公主与两名情夫连同所有秽恶的诅咒造物，在混乱中被抛入深渊。\n\n此后，镜面转暗，阿玛尔赞短暂瞥见米拉布苍白的塔楼在黑曜石般的天空中倾塌。镜子本身开始震颤，支撑它的金属蒙面雕像摇晃欲坠；萨布蒙的枝条房屋在这场掠过的地震中颤动，却因结构坚固而屹立不倒，而米拉布的豪宅宫殿尽成废墟。\n\n当大地停止漫长震颤后，萨布蒙自祈祷室走出。\n\n\"无需对已发生之事说教，\"他说道，\"你已见识肉欲的本质，亦目睹尘世腐化的历史。如今你既得智慧，当及早追寻那些不朽超然之物。\"\n\n此后，直至萨布蒙离世，阿玛尔赞都与他同住，并成为他在星象学与隐秘咒术领域的唯一传人。"

        "content": "\n\nThe legend of Mmatmuor and Sodosma shall arise only in the latter cycles of Earth, when the glad legends of the prime have been forgotten. Before the time of its telling, many epochs shall have passed away, and the seas shall have fallen in their beds, and new continents shall have come to birth. Perhaps, in that day, it will serve to beguile for a little the black weariness of a dying race, grown hopeless of all but oblivion. I tell the tale as men shall tell it in Zothique, the last continent, beneath a dim sun and sad heavens where the stars come out in terrible brightness before eventide.\n\nI\n\nMmatmuor and Sodosma were necromancers who came from the dark isle of Naat, to practise their baleful arts in Tinarath, beyond the shrunken seas. But they did not prosper in Tinarath: for death was deemed a holy thing by the people of that gray country; and the nothingness of the tomb was not lightly to be desecrated; and the raising up of the dead by necromancy was held in abomination.\n\nSo, after a short interval, Mmatmuor and Sodosma were driven forth by the anger of the inhabitants, and were compelled to flee toward Cincor, a desert of the south, which was peopled only by the bones and mummies of a race that the pestilence had slain in former time.\n\nThe land into which they went lay drear and leprous and ashen below the huge, ember-colored sun. Its crumbling rocks and deathly solitudes of sand would have struck terror to the hearts of common men; and, since they had been thrust out in that barren place without food or sustenance, the plight of the sorcerers might well have seemed a desperate one. But, smiling secretly, with the air of conquerors who tread the approaches of a long-coveted realm, Sodosma and Mmatmuor walked steadily on into Cincor\n\nUnbroken before them, through fields devoid of trees and grass, and across the channels of dried-up rivers, there ran the great highway by which travelers had gone formerly betweea Cincor and Tinarath. Here they met no living thing; but soon they came to the skeletons of a horse and its rider, lying full in the road, and wearing still the sumptuous harness and raiment which they had worn in the flesh. And Mmatmuor aad Sodosma paused before the piteous bones, on which no shred of corruption remained; and they smiled evilly at each other.\n\n'The steed shall be yours,' said Mmatmuor, 'since you are a little the elder of us two, and are thus entitled to precedence; and the rider shall serve us both and be the first to acknowledge fealty to us in Cincor.'\n\nThen, in the ashy sand by the wayside, they drew a threefold circle; and standing together at its center, they performed the abominable rites that compel the dead to arise from tranquil nothingness and obey henceforward, in all things, the dark will of the necromancer. Afterward they sprinkled a pinch of magic powder on the nostril-holes of the man and the horse; and the white bones, creaking mournfully, rose up from where they had lain and stood in readiness to serve their masters.\n\nSo, as had been agreed between them, Sodosma mounted the skeleton steed and took up the jeweled reins, and rode in an evil mockery of Death on his pale horse; while Mmatmuor trudged on beside him, leaning lightly on an ebon staff; and the skeleton of the man, with its rich raiment flapping loosely, followed behind the two like a servitor.\n\nAfter a while, in the gray waste, they found the remnant of another horse and rider, which the jackals had spared and the sun had dried to the leanness of old mummies. These also they raised up from death; and Mmatmuor bestrode the withered charger; and the two magicians rode on in state, like errant emperors, with a lich and a skeleton to attend them. Other bones and charnel remnants of men and beasts, to which they came anon, were duly resurrected in like fashion; so that they gathered to themselves an everswelling train in their progress through Cincor.\n\nAlong the way, as they neared Yethlyreom, which had been the capital, they found numerous tombs and necropoli, inviolate still after many ages, and containing swathed mummies that had scarcely withered in death. All these they raised up and called from sepulchral night to do their bidding. Some they commanded to sow and till the desert fields and hoist water from the sunken wells; others they left at diverse tasks, such as the mummies had performed in life. The century-long silence was broken by the noise and tumult of myriad activities; and the lank liches of weavers toiled at their shuttles; and the corpses of plowmen followed their furrows behind carrion oxen.\n\nWeary with their strange journey and their oft-repeated incantations, Mmatmuor and Sodosma saw before them at last, from a desert hill, the lofty spires and fair, unbroken domes of Yethlyreom, steeped in the darkening stagnant blood of ominous sunset.\n\n'It is a goodly land,' said Mmatmuor, 'and you and I will share it between us, and hold dominion over all its dead, and be crowned as emperors on the morrow in Yethlyreom.'\n\n'Aye,' replied Sodosma, 'for there is none living to dis pute us here; and those that we have summoned from the tomb shall move and breathe only at our dictation, and may not rebel against us.'\n\nSo, in the blood-red twilight that thickened with purple, they entered Yethlyreom and rode on among the lofty, lampless mansions, and installed themselves with their grisly retinue in that stately and abandoned palace, where the dynasty of Nimboth emperors had reigned for two thousand years with dominion over Cincor.\n\nIn the dusty golden halls, they lit the empty lamps of onyx by means of their cunning sorcery, and supped on royal viands, provided from past years, which they evoked in like manner. Ancient and imperial wines were poured for them in moonstone cups by the fleshless hands of their servitors; and they drank and feasted and revelled in fantasmagoric pomp, deferring till the morrow the resurrectiom of those who lay dead in Yethlyreom.\n\nThey rose betimes, in the dark crimson dawn, from the opulent palace-beds in which they had slept; for much remained to be done. Everywhere in that forgotten city, they went busily to and fro, working their spells on the people that had died in the last year of the pest and had lain unburied. And having accomplished this, they passed beyond Yethlyreom into that other city of high tombs and mighty mausoleums, in which lay the Nimboth emperors and the more consequential citizens and nobles of Cincor.\n\nHere they bade their skeleton slaves to break in the sealed doors with hammers; and then, with their sinful, tyrannous incantations, they called forth the imperial mummies, even to the eldest of the dynasty, all of whom came walking stiffly, with lightless eyes, in rich swathings sewn with flame-bright jewels. And also, later, they brought forth to a semblance of life many generations of courtiers and dignitaries.\n\nMoving in solemn pageant, with dark and haughty and hollow faces, the dead emperors and empresses of Cincor made obeisance to Mmatmuor and Sodosma, and attended them like a train of captives through all the streets of Yethlyreom. Afterward, in the immense throne-room of the palace, the necromancers mounted the high double throne, where the rightful rulers had sat with their consorts. Amid the assembled emperors, in gorgeous and funereal state, they were invested with sovereignty by the sere hands of the mummy of Hestaiyon, earliest of the Nimboth line, who had ruled in half-mythic years. Then all the descendants of Hestaiyon, crowding the room in a great throng, acclaimed with toneless, echo-like voices the dominion of Mmatmuor and Sodosma.\n\nThus did the outcast necromancers find for themselves an empire and a subject people in the desolate, barren land where the men of Tinarath had driven them forth to perish. Reignhg supreme over all the dead of Cincor, by virtue of their malign magic, they exercised a baleful despotism. Tribute was borne to them by fleshless porters from outlying realms; and plague-eaten corpses, and tall mummies scented with mortuary balsams, went to and fro upon their errands in Yethlyreom, or heaped before their greedy eyes, fmm inexhaustible vaults, the cobweb-blackened gold and dusty gems of antique time.\n\nDead laborers made their palace-gardens to bloom with long-perished flowers; liches and skeletons toiled for them in the mines, or reared superb, fantastic towers to the dying sun. Chamberlains and princes of old time were their cupbearers, and stringed instruments were plucked for their delight by the slim hands of empresses with golden hair that had come forth untarnished from the night of the tomb. Those that were fairest, whom the plague and the worm had not ravaged overmuch, they took for their lemans and made to serve their necrophilic lust.\n\nII\n\nIn all things, the people of Cincor performed the actions of life at the will of Mmatmuor and Sodosma. They spoke, they moved, they ate and drank as in life. They heard and saw and felt with a similitude of the senses that had been theirs before death; but their brains were enthralled by a dreadful necromancy. They recalled but dimly their former existence; and the state to which they had been summoned was empty and troublous and shadow-like. Their blood ran chill and sluggish, mingled with water of Lethe; and the vapors of Lethe clouded their eyes.\n\nDumbly they obeyed the dictates of their tyrannous lords, without rebellion or protest, but filled with a vague, illimitable weariness such as the dead must know, when having drunk of eternal sleep, they are called back once more to the bitterness of mortal being. They knew no passion or desire. or delight, only the black languor of their awakening from Lethe, and a gray, ceaseless longing to return to that interrupted slumber.\n\nYoungest and last of the Nimboth emperors was Illeiro, who had died in the first month of the plague. and had lain in his high-built mausoleum for two hundred years before the coming of the necromancers.\n\nRaised up with his people and his fathers to attend the tyrants, Illeiro had resumed the emptiness of existence without question and had felt no surprise. He had accepted his own resurrection and that of his ancestors as one accepts the indignities and marvels of a dream. He knew that he had come back to a faded sun, to a hollow and spectral world, to an order of things in which his place was merely that of an obedient shadow. But at first he was troubled only, like the others, by a dim weariness and pale hunger for the lost oblivion.\n\nDrugged by the magic of his overlords, weak from the age-long nullity of death, he beheld like a somnambulist the enormities to which his fathers were subjected. Yet, somehow, after many days, a feeble spark awoke in the sodden twilight of his mind.\n\nLike something lost and irretrievable, beyond prodigious gulfs, he recalled the pomp of his reign in Yethlyreom, and the golden pride and exultation that had been his in youth. And recalling it, he felt a vague stirring of revolt, a ghostly resentment against the magicians who had haled him forth to this calamitous mockery of life. Darkly he began to grieve for his fallen state, and the mournful plight of his ancestors and his people.\n\nDay by day, as a cup-bearer in the halls where he had ruled aforetime, Illeiro saw the doings of Mmatmuor and Sodosma. He saw their caprices of cruelty and lust, their growing drunkenness and gluttony. He watched them wallow in their necromantic luxury, and become lax with indolence, gross with indulgence, They neglected the study of their art, they forgot many of their spells. But still they ruled, mighty and formidable; and, lolling on couches of purple and rose, they planned to lead an army of the dead against Tinarath.\n\nDreaming of conquest, and of vaster necromancies, they grew fat and slothful as worms that have installed themselves in a charnel rich with corruption. And pace by pace with their laxness and tyranny, the fire of rebellion mounted in the shadowy heart of Illeiro, like a flame that struggles with Lethean damps. And slowly, with the waxing of his wrath, there returned to him something of the strength and firmness that had been his in life. Seeing the turpitude of the oppressors, and knowing the wrong that had been done to the helpless dead, he heard in his brain the clamor of stifled voices demanding vengeance.\n\nAmong his fathers, through the palace-halls of Yethlyreom, Illeiro moved silently at the bidding of the masters, or stood awaiting their command. He poured in their cups of onyx the amber vintages, brought by wizardry from hills beneath a younger sun; he submitted to their contumelies and insults. And night by night he watched them nod in their drunkenness, till they fell asleep, flushed and gross, amid their arrogated splendor.\n\nThere was little speech among the living dead; and son and father, daughter and mother, lover and beloved, went to and fro without sign of recognition, making no comment on their evil lot. But at last, one midnight, when the tyrants lay in slumber, and the flames wavered in the necromantic lamps, Illeiro took counsel with Hestaiyon, his eldest ancestor, who had been famed as a great wizard in fable and was reputed to have known the secret lore of antiquity.\n\nHestaiyon stood apart from the others, in a corner of the shadowy hall. He was brown and withered in his crumbling mummy-cloths; and his lightless obsidian eyes appeared to gaze still upon nothingness. He seemed not to have heard the questions of Illeiro; but at length, in a dry, rustling whisper, he responded:\n\n'I am old, and the night of the sepulcher was long, and I have forgotten much. Yet, groping backward across the void of death, it may be that I shall retrieve something of my former wisdom; and between us we shall devise a mode of deliverance.' And Hestaiyon searched among the shreds of memory, as one who reaches into a place where the worm has been and the hidden archives of old time have rotted in their covers; till at last he remembered, and said:\n\n'I recall that I was once a mighty wizard; and among other things, I knew the spells of necromancy; but employed them not, deeming their use and the raising up of the dead an abhorrent act. Also, I possessed other knowledge; and perhaps, among the remnants of that ancient lore, there is something which may serve to guide us now. For I recall a dim, dubitable prophecy, made in the primal years, at the founding of Yethlyreom and the empire of Cincor. The prophecy was, that an evil greater than death would befall the emperors and the people of Cincor in future times; and that the first and the last of the Nimboth dynasty, conferring together, would effect a mode of release and the lifting of the doom. The evil was not named in the prophecy: but it was said that the two emperors would learn the solution of their problem by the breaking of an ancient clay image that guards the nethermost vault below the imperial palace in Yethlyreom.'\n\nThen, having heard this prophecy from the faded lips of his forefather, Illeiro mused a while, and said:\n\n'I remember now an afternoon in early youth, when searching idly through the unused vaults of our palace, as a boy might do, I came to the last vault and found therein a dusty, uncouth image of clay, whose form and countenance were strange to me. And, knowing not the prophecy. I turned away in disappointment, and went back as idly as I had come, to seek the moted sunlight.'\n\nThen, stealing away from their heedless kinfolk, and carrying jeweled lamps they had taken from the hall, Hestaiyon and Illeiro went downward by subterranean stairs beneath the palace; and, threading like implacable furtive shadows the maze of nighted corridors, they came at last to the lowest crypt.\n\nHere, in the black dust and clotted cobwebs of an immemorial past, they found, as had been decreed, the clay image, whose rude features were those of a forgotten earthly god. And Illeiro shattered the image with a fragment of stone; and he and Hestaiyon took from its hollow center a great sword of unrusted steel, and a heavy key of untarnished bronze, and tablets of bright brass on which were inscribed the various things to be done, so that Cincor should be rid of the dark reign of the necromancers and the people should win back to oblivious death.\n\nSo, with the key of untarnished bronze, Illeiro unlocked, as the tablets had instructed him to do, a low and narrow door at the end of the nethermost vault, beyond the broken image; and he and Hestaiyon saw, as had been prophesied, the coiling steps of somber stone that led downward to an undiscovered abyss, where the sunken fires of earth still burned. And leaving Illeiro to ward the open door, Hestaiyon took up the sword of unrusted steel in his thin hand, and went back to the hall where the necromancers slept, lying a-sprawl on their couches of rose and purple, with the wan, bloodless dead about them in patient ranks.\n\nUpheld by the ancient prophecy and the lore of the bright tablets, Hestaiyon lifted the great sword and struck off the head of Mmatmuor and the head of Sodosma, each with a single blow. Then, as had been directed, he quartered the remains with mighty strokes. And the necromancers gave up their unclean lives, and lay supine, without movement, adding a deeper red to the rose and a brighter hue to the sad purple of their couches.\n\nThen, to his kin, who stood silent and listless, hardly knowing their liberation, the venerable mummy of Hestaiyon spoke in sere murmurs, but authoritatively, as a king who issues commands to his children. The dead emperors and empresses stirred, like autumn leaves in a sudden wind, and a whisper passed among them and went forth from the palace, to be communicated at length, by devious ways, to all the dead of Cincor.\n\nAll that night, and during the blood-dark day that followed, by wavering torches or the light of the failing sun, an endless army of plague-eaten liches, of tattered skeletons, poured in a ghastly torrent through the streets of Yethlyreom and along the palace-hall where Hestaiyon stood guard above the slain necromancers. Unpausing, with vague, fixed eyes, they went on like driven shadows, to seek the subterraaean vaults below the palace, to pass through the open door where Illeiro waited in the last vault, and then to wend downward by a thousand thousand steps to the verge of that gulf in which boiled the ebbing fires of earth. There, from the verge, they flung themselves to a second death and the clean annihilation of the bottomless flames.\n\nBut, after all had gone to their release, Hestaiyon still remained, alone in the fading sunset, beside the cloven corpses of Mmatmuor and Sodosma. There, as the tablets had directed him to do, he made trial of those spells of elder necromancy which he had known in his former wisdom, and cursed the dismembered bodies with that perpetual life-in-death which Mmatmuor and Sodosma had sought to inflict upon the people of Cincor. And maledictions came from the pale lips, and the heads rolled horribly with glaring eyes, and the limbs and torsos writhed on their imperial couches amid clotted blood. Then, with no backward look, knowing that all was done as had been ordained and predicted from the first, the mummy of Hestaiyon left the necromancers to their doom, and went wearily through the nighted labyrinth of vaults to rejoin Illeiro.\n\nSo, in tranquil silence, with no further need of words, Illeiro and Hestaiyon passed through the open door of the nether vault, and Illeiro locked the door behind them with its key of untarnished bronze. And thence, by the coiling stairs, they wended their way to the verge of the sunken flames and were one with their kinfolk and their people in the last, ultinate nothingness.\n\nBut of Mmatmuor and Sodosma, men say that their quartered bodies crawl to and fro to this day in Yethlyreom, finding no peace or respite from their doom of life-indeath. and seeking vainly through the black maze of nether vaults the door that was locked by Illeiro.",
        "content_cn": "姆玛特穆尔与索多斯玛的传说只会在后世轮回中浮现，那时太古的欢愉神话早已湮灭。在这个故事被讲述之前，无数纪元已然消逝，海床干涸沉降，新大陆自深渊隆起。或许到那时，这个传说能为垂死种族那除却湮灭外别无希冀的黑色倦怠，提供片刻消遣。我将讲述佐西克大陆上人类传诵的传说——在那最后的陆地上，黯淡太阳与哀伤天穹之下，群星总在黄昏前绽放骇人光芒。\n\n一\n\n姆玛特穆尔与索多斯玛是从黑暗之岛纳特而来的死灵术士，他们越过萎缩的海洋，在提纳拉斯施展邪恶法术。但他们在提纳拉斯并不顺遂：那片灰暗国度的人民视死亡为神圣之事，坟墓的虚无不容亵渎，以死灵术唤醒亡者更被视为大逆不道。因此不久后，愤怒的居民便将两位死灵术士驱逐出境，迫使他们逃往南方荒漠辛科尔——那里唯有瘟疫年代遗留的枯骨与木乃伊。\n\n他们踏入的土地在余烬色巨日下呈现腐朽的灰白。崩塌的岩壁与死寂沙丘足以令常人胆寒；而这对被放逐至此却无粮无水的巫师而言，处境似乎已至绝境。但索多斯玛与姆玛特穆尔却带着征服者踏入梦寐疆域的神情，挂着隐秘笑容稳步走入辛科尔。\n\n贯穿无木无草的荒野，跨越干涸的河床，那条连接辛科尔与提纳拉斯的古老大道在他们面前延伸。路上不见活物，很快他们便遇见横陈道中的马匹与骑手骸骨，华美鞍具与服饰仍如生前般完好。姆玛特穆尔与索多斯玛在这未腐的枯骨前驻足，彼此露出阴险笑容。\n\n\"这坐骑归你，\"姆玛特穆尔说道，\"因你年长于我，理当优先；而这骑手将侍奉我们二人，成为辛科尔首个向我们效忠的仆从。\"\n\n他们在路旁灰沙上画出三重法阵，立于中央施行亵渎仪式，迫使亡者挣脱虚无之境，永远服从死灵术士的黑暗意志。随后他们将魔法粉末撒入人与马的鼻腔，白骨便发出哀鸣立起，静候主人差遣。\n\n依约索多斯玛跨上骸骨战马，执起镶缰绳，如死神骑苍白坐骑般邪恶巡行；姆玛特穆尔拄黑檀杖徒步相随；而那具华服松垮的骑手骸骨，则如仆从般跟在二人身后。\n\n灰败荒原中，他们又遇见豺狼未食、烈日风干的另一对马匹与骑手残骸。他们同样将其唤醒，姆玛特穆尔骑上枯槁战马。两位法师如游荡帝王般庄严行进，由一具僵尸与一具骸骨随侍。沿途所遇更多人兽遗骨，皆被如法复活，使得穿越辛科尔的队伍不断壮大。\n\n临近昔日都城耶斯莱瑞姆时，他们发现历经岁月仍完好无损的陵墓群，其中包裹着几乎未腐的缠尸。他们唤醒所有这些亡者，令其脱离墓穴长夜供其驱使。有的被派去耕种荒漠，从深井汲水；有的则从事生前旧业。亘古寂静被万千活动的喧嚣打破：织工僵尸操弄梭机，农夫尸骸驱赶腐牛犁地。\n\n历经奇异旅程与反复施咒，疲惫的姆玛特穆尔与索多斯玛终于从沙丘上望见耶斯莱瑞姆——高耸尖塔与完美穹顶浸没在不祥夕照的淤血暮色中。\n\n\"这是片丰饶之地，\"姆玛特穆尔说，\"你我共享此域，统御所有亡者，明日便可在耶斯莱瑞姆加冕为帝。\"\n\n\"正是，\"索多斯玛应道，\"此地无生者与我们相争，那些从坟墓唤起的仆从只会依令行动，永无反抗之力。\"\n\n于是他们乘着紫霭渐浓的血色黄昏进入耶斯莱瑞姆，穿过无灯的高耸宅邸，带着恐怖随从入驻那座宏伟废宫——曾统治辛科尔两千年的宁博斯王朝皇宫。\n\n在积尘的金色大厅，他们以诡术点燃缟玛瑙空灯，召唤往昔御膳享用。侍从们以枯骨之手用月长石杯斟满古老御酒；他们纵饮狂欢于幻象般的奢靡中，将唤醒全城亡者的计划延至次日。\n\n深红黎明时分，他们从奢华宫床起身，因诸多事务尚待完成。在这被遗忘之城的每个角落，他们忙碌地施咒于瘟疫末年未葬的死者。完成后，他们越过耶斯莱瑞姆进入陵墓之城——那里安息着宁博斯帝王与辛科尔权贵。\n\n他们令骷髅奴隶以锤破封门，以邪恶咒语唤出帝王木乃伊，直至王朝最古老的那位——全都裹着缝缀焰色宝石的华服，目光空洞地僵硬行走。随后又唤出历代朝臣显贵。\n\n辛科尔的亡故帝后们以阴郁傲慢的枯容列队行进，向姆玛特穆尔与索多斯玛臣服，如俘虏般随其穿过耶斯莱瑞姆所有街道。最终在皇宫巨大的王座厅内，死灵术士登上历代正统君主与王后共坐的双重王座。在华丽丧仪中，宁博斯王朝始祖赫斯塔永的木乃伊以干枯之手为他们加冕——这位半神话时代的统治者与其后代挤满大厅，以空洞回声般的嗓音宣告姆玛特穆尔与索多斯玛的统治。\n\n就这样，被放逐的死灵术士在这提纳拉斯人欲使其灭亡的荒芜之地建立了帝国。凭借邪恶魔力统御辛科尔所有亡者，他们施行暴政。无血肉的脚夫从边远地域运来贡品；染疫尸体与熏香木乃伊为其奔走，从无尽墓穴搬出蛛网覆盖的古老黄金与尘封宝石堆满他们贪婪的眼前。\n\n亡者劳工使宫苑绽放早已灭绝的鲜花；僵尸与骷髅在矿坑劳作，或为将逝夕阳筑起奇异高塔。往昔的亲王大臣为其斟酒，皇后们从墓夜归来的金发未损，以纤手拨弦取悦他们。那些未被瘟疫与蛆虫过度摧残的美貌者，则沦为满足他们恋尸癖的玩物。\n\n二\n\n辛科尔人民依姆玛特穆尔与索多斯玛的意志演绎着生前行为。他们言谈、行动、饮食如常，感官似与生前无异，但大脑已被恐怖死灵术奴役。他们仅模糊记得往昔存在，被唤回的状态空虚而困扰如影。血液冰冷迟缓，混有忘川之水；眼中蒙着忘川雾气。\n\n他们默然服从暴君命令，毫无反抗却充满死者特有的无尽倦怠——畅饮永恒安眠后又被唤回尘世苦难。他们不知激情、欲望或欢愉，只有苏醒自忘川的黑色倦怠，与回归中断长眠的灰色渴望。\n\n宁博斯王朝最年轻末代君主伊莱罗死于瘟疫首月，在死灵术士到来前已安息陵墓两百年。\n\n与臣民先祖一同被唤醒侍奉暴君时，伊莱罗毫无异议地接受空虚存在。他将自己与祖先的复活视为梦境中的屈辱奇迹。他明白自己回到黯淡太阳下的虚幻世界，沦为顺从的幽灵。但起初他如他人般只被朦胧倦怠与对湮灭的苍白渴望所困。\n\n被领主魔法麻痹，因漫长死亡而虚弱，他梦游般目睹先祖们遭受的暴行。然而多日后，他混沌意识中微弱火花终被点燃。\n\n他忆起耶斯莱瑞姆的帝王荣光，青春的金色骄傲与欢欣——如隔深渊般遥不可及。回忆唤起反抗的幽暗悸动，对将其拖入灾难性生命嘲弄的术士生出幽灵般的怨恨。他开始为自身堕落、先祖与臣民的悲惨境遇暗自发痛。\n\n作为昔日统治殿堂的侍酒者，伊莱罗日复一日见证姆玛特穆尔与索多斯玛的暴行：残酷与淫欲的反复无常，日益沉溺的饕餮酗酒。他目睹他们在死灵奢华中堕落，因怠惰而松弛，因放纵而臃肿。他们荒废法术研习，遗忘诸多咒语。却仍强大可怖地统治着，在紫红软榻上谋划率领亡灵大军进攻提纳拉斯。\n\n征服梦与更宏大死灵术的幻想使他们如蛆虫般在富腐的墓室发胖。随着暴君们的堕落与暴政，伊莱罗阴影之心中反抗之火如对抗忘川潮气的烈焰渐燃。愤怒增长间，他逐渐重获生前力量与坚定。目睹压迫者的卑劣，知晓无助亡者遭受的苦难，他脑中响起要求复仇的压抑呐喊。\n\n在他历代先祖的幽影间，伊莱罗遵照主人们的命令，悄然穿行于耶斯里瑞姆宫的厅堂，或静立待命。他为那些暴君斟满玛瑙杯中的琥珀酒浆——那是巫术从年轻太阳照耀下的山丘取来的陈酿；他默默忍受着他们的轻蔑与侮辱。夜复一夜，他注视着这些醉醺醺的暴君点头打盹，直到他们在那僭越的辉煌中满面通红、臃肿不堪地昏睡过去。\n\n活死人们极少交谈；父子、母女、爱侣之间擦肩而过时毫无相认的迹象，对自身可怖命运亦无只言片语。直到某个午夜，当暴君们陷入酣眠，亡灵灯盏中的火焰开始摇曳时，伊莱罗终于向最年长的先祖赫斯泰昂求教——这位在传说中以大巫师闻名、据说通晓远古秘术的祖先。\n\n赫斯泰昂独自伫立在阴影笼罩的大厅角落。裹尸布碎片下的身躯呈现枯槁的褐色，无光的黑曜石双眼仿佛仍凝视着虚无。他起初似乎没听见伊莱罗的询问，最终才以干涩的窸窣低语回应：\n\n\"我太老了，墓穴中的长夜吞噬了太多记忆。但若向死亡的虚空中回溯，或许能找回些许往昔智慧；我们或可共同谋划解脱之法。\"赫斯泰昂在记忆残片中搜寻，如同探入虫蛀的古老档案室，直至终于想起：\"我曾是强大的巫师，通晓亡灵法术却从未使用，视唤醒死者为渎神之举。此外我还知晓某些古老预言——在辛科尔帝国与耶斯里瑞姆城建立之初，曾有晦暗的预言称：未来将有比死亡更可怕的灾祸降临皇室。当宁博斯王朝首位与末代君主共谋时，方能找到解除诅咒之法。预言未言明灾祸本质，只提及两位君主需打破皇宫最底层密室中守护的古老陶像，方能获知解法。\"\n\n听闻先祖枯唇间吐露的预言，伊莱罗沉思片刻道：\"我幼时曾在宫中废弃地窖游荡，于最深处见过积尘的怪异陶像，其形貌令我陌生。当时不知预言，便失望离去。\"于是二人携镶嵌宝石的灯盏，潜下宫殿深处的阶梯。他们如执着的幽影穿过黑暗回廊，最终抵达最底层墓室。\n\n在亘古积累的黑尘与蛛网间，他们找到了预言所述的陶像——其粗陋面容属于某个被遗忘的尘世神明。伊莱罗以石块击碎陶像，与赫斯泰昂从中取出一柄永不锈蚀的钢剑、一把锃亮的青铜巨钥，以及记载着解放辛科尔步骤的黄铜铭板。\n\n遵照铭板指示，伊莱罗用青铜钥开启了陶像后方低矮窄门。门后是盘旋向下的幽暗石阶，通往地心尚未熄灭的火焰深渊。留下伊莱罗守门，赫斯泰昂以枯瘦之手提起钢剑返回大厅，将酣睡在玫瑰紫绸榻上的巫师姆玛特穆尔与索多斯玛斩首分尸。暴君们污秽的生命就此终结，他们的鲜血浸透了华贵的床榻。\n\n赫斯泰昂继而向茫然静立的皇室亡灵发出沙哑而威严的宣告。死去的帝后们如秋叶般颤动，低语如涟漪般传遍耶斯里瑞姆。当夜至次日血日西沉时，无数溃烂的尸骸与褴褛白骨形成恐怖洪流，穿过街道与宫室，持续不断地涌入地底墓穴。它们跨过伊莱罗守卫的窄门，沿无尽阶梯投身地心烈焰，获得纯净的湮灭。\n\n待最后一位亡灵解脱后，赫斯泰昂对巫师残躯施下永生咒——正是暴君们曾企图施加于辛科尔子民的活死人之刑。被诅咒的头颅滚动瞪视，残肢在血泊中扭动。完成使命的木乃伊穿过黑暗迷宫与伊莱罗汇合，二人沉默地锁上青铜门，共同步向阶梯尽头的深渊，与族人共赴终极虚无。\n\n至于姆玛特穆尔与索多斯玛？传说他们被肢解的躯体至今仍在耶斯里瑞姆爬行，在永世折磨中徒劳寻找着被伊莱罗锁上的那扇门。"

        "content": "\n\nBetween the sun's departure and return, the Silver Death had fallen upon Yoros. Its advent, however, had been foretold in many prophecies, both immemorial and recent. Astrologers had said that this mysterious malady, heretofore unknown on earth, would descend from the great star, Achernar, which presided balefully over all the lands of the southern continent of Zothique; and having sealed the flesh of a myriad men with its bright, metallic pallor, the plague would still go onward in time and space, borne by the dim currents of ether to other worlds.\n\nDire was the Silver Death; and none knew the secret of its contagion or the cure. Swift as the desert wind, it came into Yoros from the devastated realm of Tasuun, overtaking the very messengers who ran by night to give warning of its nearness. Those who were smitten felt an icy, freezing cold, an instant rigor, as if the outermost gulf had breathed upon them. Their faces and bodies whitened strangely, gleaming with a wan luster, and became stiff as long-dead corpses, all in an interim of minutes.\n\nIn the streets of Silpon and Siloar, and in Faraad, the capital of Yoros, the plague passed like an eery, glittering light from countenance to countenance under the golden lamps; and the victims fell where they were stricken; and the deathly brightness remained upon them.\n\nThe loud, tumultuous public carnivals were stifled by its passing, and the merry-makers were frozen in frolic attitudes. In proud mansions, the wine-flushed revelers grew pale amid their garish feasts, and reclined in their opulent chairs, still holding the half-emptied cups with rigid fingers. Merchants lay in their counting-houses on the heaped coins they had begun to reckon; and thieves, entering later, were unable to depart with their booty. Diggers died in the half completed graves they had dug for others; but no one came to dispute their possession.\n\nThere was no time to flee from the strange, inevitable scourge. Dreadfully and quickly, beneath the clear stars, it breathed upon Yoros; and few were they who awakened from slumber at dawn. Fulbra, the young king of Yoros, who had but newly suceeeded to the throne, was virtually a ruler without a people.\n\nFulbra had spent the night of the plague's advent on a high tower of his palace above Faraad: an observatory tower, equipped with astronomical appliances. A great heaviness had lain on his heart, and his thoughts were dulled with an opiate despair; but sleep was remote from his eye-lids. He knew the many predictions that foretold the Silver Death; and moreover he had read its imminent coming in the stars, with the aid of the old astrologer and sorcerer, Vemdeez. This latter knowledge he and Vemdeez had not cared to promulgate, knowing full well that the doom of Yoros was a thing decreed from all time by infinite destiny; and that no man could evade the doom, unless it were written that he should die in another way than this.\n\nNow Vemdeez had cast the horoscope of Fulbra; and though he found therein certain ambiguities that his science could not resolve, it was nevertheless written plainly that the king would not die in Yoros. Where he would die, and in what manner, were alike doubtful. But Vemdeez, who had served Altath the father of Fulbra, and was no less devoted to the new ruler, had wrought by means of his magical art an enchanted ring that would protect Fulbra from the Silver Death in all times and places. The ring was made of a strange. red metal, darker than ruddy gold or copper, and was set with a black and oblong gem, not known to terrestrial lapidaries, that gave forth eternally a strong aromatic perfume. The sorcerer told Fulbra never to remove the ring from the middle finger on which he wore it — not even in lands afar from Yoros and in days after the passing of the Silver Death: for if once the plague had breathed upon Fulbra, he would bear its subtle contagion always in his flesh; and the contagion would assume its wonted virulence with the ring's removal. But Vemdeez did not tell the origin of the red metal and the dark gem, nor the price at which the protective magic had been purchased.\n\nWith a sad heart, Fulbra had accepted the ring and had worn it; and so it was that the Silver Death blew over him in the night and harmed him not. But waiting anxiously on the high tower, and watching the golden lights of Faraad rather than the white, implacable stars, he felt a light, passing chillness that belonged not to the summer air. And even as it passed the gay noises of the city ceased; and the moaning lutes faltered strangely and expired. A stillness crept on the carnival; and some of the lamps went out and were not re-lit. In the palace beneath him there was also silence; and he heard no more the laughter of his courtiers and chamberlains. And Vemdeez came not, as was his custom, to join Fulbra on the tower at midnight. So Fulbra knew himself for a realmless king; and the grief that he still felt for the noble Altath was swollen by a great sorrow for his perished people.\n\nHour by hour he sat motionless, too sorrowful for tears. The stars changed above him; and Achernar glared dovm perpetually like the bright, cruel eye of a mocking demon; and the heavy balsam of the black-jeweled ring arose to his nostrils and seemed to stifle him. And once the thought occurred to Fulbra, to cast the ring away and die as his people had died. But his despair was too heavy upon him even for this; and so, at length, the dawn came slowly in heavens pale as the Silver Death, and found him still on the tower.\n\nIn the dawn, King Fulbra rose and descended the coiled stairs of porphyry into his palace. And midway on the stairs he saw the fallen corpse of the old sorcerer Vemdeez, who had died even as he climbed to join his master. The wrinkled face of Vemdeez was like polished metal, and was whiter than his beard and hair; and his open eyes, which had been dark as sapphires, were frosted with the plague. Then, grieving greatly for the death of Vemdeez, whom he had loved, as a foster-father, the king went slowly on. And in the suites and halls below, he found the bodies of his courtiers and servants and guardsmen. And none remained alive, excepting three slaves who warded the green, brazen portals of the lower vaults, far beneath the palace.\n\nNow Fulbra bethought him of the counsel of Vemdeez, who had urged him to flee from Yoros and to seek shelter in the southern isle of Cyntrom, which paid tribute to the kings of Yoros. And though he had no heart for this, nor for any course of action, Fulbra bade the three remaining slaves to gather food and such other supplies as were necessary for a voyage of some length, and to carry them aboard a royal barge of ebony that was moored at the palace porticoes on the river Voum,\n\nThen, embarking with the slaves, he took the helm of the barge, and directed the slaves to unfurl the broad amber sail. And past the stately city of Faraad, whose streets were thronged with the silvery dead, they sailed on the widening jasper estuary of the Voum, and into the amaranth-colored guIf of the Indaskian Sea.\n\nA favorable wind was behind them, blowing from the north over desolate Tasuun and Yoros, even as the Silver Death had blown in the night. And idly beside them, on the Voum, there floated seaward many vessels whose crews and captains had all died of the plague. And Faraad was still as a necropolis of old time; and nothing stirred on the estuary shores, excepting the plumy, fanshapen palms that swayed southward in the freshening wind. And soon the green strand of Yoros receded, gathering to itself the blueness and the dreams of distance.\n\nCreaming with a winy foam, full of strange murmurous voices and vague tales of exotic things, the halcyon sea was about the voyagers now beneath the high-lifting summer sun. But the sea's enchanted voices and its long languorous, immeasurable cradling could not soothe the sorrow of Fulbra; and in his heart a despair abided, black as the gem that was set in the red ring af Vemdeez.\n\nHowbeit, he held the great helm of the ebon barge, and steered as straightly as he could by the sun toward Cyntrom. The amber sail was taut with the favoring wind; and the barge sped onward all that day, cleaving the amaranth waters with its dark prow that reared in the carven form of an ebony goddess. And when the night came with familiar austral stars, Fulbra was able to correct such errors as he had made in reckoning the course.\n\nFor many days they flew southward; and the sun lowered a little in its circling behind them; and new stars climbed and clustered at evening about the black goddess of the prow. And Fulbra, who had once sailed to the isle of Cymtrom in boyhood days with his father Altath, thought to see ere long the lifting of its shores of camphor and sandalwood from the winy deep. But in his heart there was no gladness; and often now he was blinded by wild tears, remembering that other voyage with Altath.\n\nThen, suddenly and at high noon, there fell an airless cabin, and the waters became as purple glass about the barge. The sky changed to a dome of beaten copper, arching close and low; and as if by some evil wizardry, the dome darkened with untimely night, and a tempest rose like the gathered breath of mighty devils and shaped the sea into vast ridges, and abysmal valleys. The mast of ebony snapped like a reed in the wind, and the sail was torn asunder, and the helpless vessel pitched headlong in the dark troughs and was hurled upward through veils of blinding foam to the giddy summits of the billows.\n\nFulbra clung to the useless helm, and the slaves, at his command, took shelter in the forward cabin. For countless hours they were borne onward at the will of the mad hurricane; and Fulbra could see naught in the lowering gloom, except the pale crests of the beetling waves; and he could tell no longer the direction of their course.\n\nThen, in that lurid dusk, he beheld at intervals another vessel that rode the storm-driven sea, not far from the barge. He thought that the vessel was a galley such as might be used by merchants that voyaged among the southern isles, trading for incense and plumes and vermilion; but its oars were mostly broken, and the toppled mast and sail hung forward on the prow.\n\nFor a time the ships drove on together; till Fulbra saw, in a rifting of the gloom, the sharp and somber crags of an unknown shore, with sharper towers that lifted palely above them. He could not turn the helm; and the barge and its companion vessel were carried toward the looming rocks, till Fulbra thought that they would crash thereon. But, as if by some enchantment, even as it had risen, the sea fell abruptly in a windless calm; and quiet sunlight poured from a clearing sky; and the barge was left on a broad crescent of ochre-yellow sand between the crags and the lulling waters, with the galley beside it.\n\nDazed and marveling, Fulbra leaned on the helm, while his slaves crept timidly forth from the cabin, and men began to appear on the decks of the galley. And the king was about to hail these men, some of whom were dressed as humble sailors and others in the fashion of rich merchants. But he heard a laughter of strange voices, high and shrill and somehow evil, that seemed to fall from above; and looking up he saw that many people were descending a sort of stairway in the cliffs that enclosed the beach.\n\nThe people drew near, thronging about the barge and the galley. They wore fantastic turbans of blood-red, and were clad in closely fitting robes of vulturine black. Their faces and hands were yellow as saffron; their small and slaty eyes were set obliquely beneath lashless lids; and their thin lips, which smiled eternally, were crooked. as the blades of scimitars.\n\nThey bore sinister and wicked-looking weapons, in the form of saw-toothed swords and doubled-headed spears. Some of them bowed low before Fulbra and addressed him obsequiously, staring upon him all the while with an unblinking gaze that he could not fathom. Their speech was no less alien than their aspect; it was full of sharp and hissing sounds; and neither the king nor his slaves could comprehend it. But Fulbra bespoke the people courteously, in the mild and mellow-flowing tongue of Yoros, and inquired the name of this land whereon the barge had been cast by the tempest.\n\nCertain of the people seemed to understand him, for a light came in their slaty eyes at his question; and one of them answered brokenly in the language of Yoros, saying that the land was the Isle of Uccastrog, Then, with something of covert evil in his smile, this person added that all shipwrecked mariners and seafarers would receive a goodly welcome from Ildrac, the king of the Isle.\n\nAt this, the heart of Fulbra sank within him; for he had heard numerous tales of Uccastrog in bygone years; and the tales were not such as would reassure a stranded traveler. Uccastrog, which lay far to the east of Cyntrom, was commonly known as the Isle of the Torturers; and men said that all who landed upon it unaware, or were cast thither by the seas, were imprisoned by the inhabitants and were subjected later to unending curious tortures whose infliction formed the chief delight of these cruel beings. No man, it was rumored, had ever escaped from Uccastrog; but many had lingered for years in its dungeons and hellish torture chambers, kept alive for the pleasure of King Ildrac and his followers. Also, it was believed that the Torturers were great magicians who could raise mighty storms with their enchantments, and could cause vessels to be carried far from the maritime routes, and then fling them ashore upon Uccastrog.\n\nSeeing that the yellow people were all about the barge, and that no escape was possible, Fulbra asked them to take him at once before King Ildrac. To Ildrac he would announce his name and royal rank; and it seemed to him, in his simplicity, that one king, even though cruel-hearted, would scarceIy torture another or keep him captive. Also, it might be that the inhabitants of Uccastrog had been somewhat maligned by the tales of travelers.\n\nSo Fulbra and his slaves were surrounded by certain of the throng and were led toward the palace of Ildrac, whose high, sharp towers crowned the crags beyond the beach, rising above those clustered abodes in which the island people dwelt. And while they were climbing the hewn steps in the cliff, Fulbra heard a loud outcry below and a clashing of steel against steel; and looking back, he saw that the crew of the stranded galley had drawn their swords and were fighting the islanders. But being outnumbered greatly, their resistance was borne down by the swarming Torturers; and most of them were taken alive. And Fulbra's heart misgave him sorely at this sight; and more and nore did he mistrust the yellow people.\n\nSoon he came into the presence of Ildrac, who sat on a lofty brazen chair in a vast hall of the palace. Ildrac was taller by half a head than any of his followers; and his features were like a mask of evil wrought from some pale, gilded metal; and he was clad in vestments of a strange hue, like sea-purple brightened with fresh-flowing blood. About him were many guardsmen, armed with terrible scythe-like weapons; and the sullen, slant-eyed girls of the palace, in skirts of vermilion and breast-cups of lazuli, went to and fro among huge basaltic columns. About the hall stood numerous engineries of wood and stone and metal such as Fulbra had never beheld, and having a formidable aspect with their heavy chains, their beds of iron teeth and their cords and pulleys of fish-skin.\n\nThe young king of Yoros went forward with a royal and fearless bearing, and addressed Ildrac, who sat motionless and eyed him with a level, unwinking gaze. And Fulbra told Ildrac his name and station, and the calamity that had caused him to flee from Yoros; and he mentioned also his urgent desire to reach the Isle of Cyntrom.\n\n'It is a long voyage to Cyntrom,' said Ildrac, with a subtle smile. 'Also, it is not our custom to permit guests to depart without having fully tasted the hospitality of the Isle of Uccastrog. Therefore, King Fulbra, I must beg you to curb your impatience. We have much to show you here, and many diversions to offer. My chamberlains will now conduct you to a room befitting your royal rank. But first I must ask you to leave with me the sword that you carry at your side; for swords are often sharp — and I do not wish my guests to suffer injury by their own hands.'\n\nSo Fulbra's sword was taken from him by one of the palace guardsmen; and a small ruby-hilted dagger that he carried was also removed. Then several of the guards, hemming him in with their scythed weapons, led him from the hall and by many corridors and downward flights of stairs into the soft rock beneath the palace. And he knew not whither his three slaves were taken, or what disposition was made of the captured crew of the galley. And soon he passed from the daylight into cavernous halls illumed by sulfur-colored flames in copper cressets; and all around him, in hidden chambers, he heard the sound of dismal moans and loud, maniacal howlings that seemed to beat and die upon adamantine doors.\n\nIn one of these halls, Fulbra and his guardsnen met a young girl, fairer and less sullen of aspect than the others; and Fulbra thought that the girl smiled upon him compassionately as he went by; and it seemed that she murmured faintly in the language of Yoros: 'Take heart, King Fulbra,' for there is one who would help you.' And her words apparently, were not heeded or understood by the guards, who knew only the harsh and hissing tongue of Uccastrog.\n\nAfter descending many stairs, they came to a ponderous door of bronze; and the door was unlocked by one of the guards, and Fulbra was compelled to enter; and the door clanged dolorously behind him. The chamber into which he had been thrust was walled on three sides with the dark stone of the island, and was walled on the fourth with heavy, unbreakable glass. Beyond the glass he saw the blue-green, glimnering waters of the undersea, lit by the hanging cressets of the chamber; and in the waters were great devil-fish whose tentacles writhed along the wall; and huge pythonomorphs with fabulous golden coils receding in the gloom; and the floating corpses of men that stared in upon him with eyeballs from which the lids had been excised.\n\nThere was a couch in one comer of the dungeon, close to the wall of glass; and food and drink had been supplied for Fulbra in vessels of wood. The king laid himself down, weary and hopeless, without tasting the food. Then, lying with close-shut eyes while the dead men and sea-monsters peered in upon him by the glare of the cressets, he strove to forget his griefs and the dolorous doom that impended. And through his clouding terror and sorrow, he seemed to see the comely face of the girl who had smiled upon him compassionately, and who, alone of all that he had met in Uccastrog, had spoken to him with words of kindness. The face returned ever and anon, with a soft haunting, a gentle sorcery; and Fulbra felt, for the first time in many suns, the dim stirring of his buried youth and the vague, obscure desire of life. So, after a while, he slept; and the face of the girl came still before him in his dreams.\n\nThe cressets burned above him with undiminished flames when he awakened; and the sea beyond the wall of glass was thronged with the same monsters as before, or with others of like kind. But amid the floating corpses he now beheld the flayed bodies of his own slaves, who, after being tortured by the island people, had been cast forth into the submarine cavern that adjoined his dungeon, so that he might see them on awakening.\n\nHe sickened with new horror at the sight; but even as he stared at the dead faces, the door of bronze swung open with a sullen grinding, and his guards entered. Seeing that he had not consumed the food and water provided for him, they forced him to eat and drink a little, menacing him with their broad, crooked blades till he complied. And then they led him from the dungeon and took him before King Ildrac, in the great hall of tortures.\n\nFulbra saw, by the level golden light through the palace windows and the long shadows of the columns and machines of torment, that the time was early dawn. The hall was crowded with the Torturers and their women; and many seemed to look on while others, of both sexes, busied themselves with ominous preparations. And Fulbra saw that a tall brazen statue, with cruel and demonian visage, like some implacable god of the underworld, was now standing at the right hand of Ildrac where he sat aloft on his brazen chair.\n\nFulbra was thrust forward by his guards, and Ildrac greeted him briefly, with a wily smile that preceded the words and lingered after them. And when Ildrac had spoken, the brazen image also began to speak, addressing Fulbra in the language of Yoros, with strident and metallic tones, and telling him with full and minute circumstance the various infernal tortures to which he was to be subjected on that day.\n\nWhen the statue had done speaking, Fulbra heard a soft whisper in his ear, and saw beside him the fair girl whom he had previously met in the nether corridors. And the girl, seemingly unheeded by the Torturers, said to him: 'Be courageous, and endure bravely all that is inflicted; for I shall effect your release before another day, if this be possible.'\n\nFulbra was cheered by the girl's assurance; and it seemed to him that she was fairer to look upon than before; and he thought that her eyes regarded him tenderly; and the twin desires of love and life were strangely resurrected in his heart, to fortify him against the tortures of Ildrac.\n\nOf that which was done to Fulbra for the wicked pleasure of King Ildrac and his people, it were not well to speak fully. For the islanders of Uccastrog had designed innumerable torments, curious and subtle, wherewith to harry and excruciate the five senses; and they could harry the brain itself, driving it to extremes more terrible than madness; and could take away the dearest treasures of memory and leave unutterable foulness in their place.\n\nOn that day, however, they did not torture Fulbra to the uttermost. But they racked his ears with cacophonous sounds; with evil flutes that chilled the blood and curdled it upon his heart; with deep drums that seemed to ache in all his tissues; and thin tabors that wrenched his very bones. Then they compelled him to breathe the mounting fumes of braziers wherein the dried gall of dragons and the adipocere of dead cannibals were burned together with a fetid wood. Then, when the fire had died down, they freshened it with the oil of vampire bats; and Fulbra swooned, unable to bear the fetor any longer.\n\nLater, they stripped away his kingly vestments and fastened about his body a silken girdle that had been freshly dipt in an acid carrosive only to human flesh; and the acid ate slowly, fretting his skin with infinite pangs.\n\nThen, after removing the girdle lest it slay him, the Torturers brought in certain creatures that had the shape of elllong serpents, but were covered from head to tail with sable hairs like those of a caterpillar. And these creatures twined themselves tightly about the arms and legs of Fulbra; and though he fought wildly in his revulsion, he could not loosen them with his hands; and the hairs that covered their constringent coils began to pierce his limbs like a million tiny needles, till he screamed with the agony. And when his breath failed him and he could scream no longer, the baby serpents were induced to relinquish their hold by a languorous piping of which the islanders knew the secret. They dropped away and left him; but the mark of their coils was imprinted redly about his limbs; and around his body there burned the raw branding of the girdle.\n\nKing Ildrac and his people looked on with a dreadful gloating; for in such things they took their joy, and strove to pacify an implacable obscure desire. But seeing now that Fulbra could endure no more, and wishing to wreak their will upon him for many future days, they took him back to his dungeon.\n\nLying sick with remembered horror, feverish with pain, he longed not for the clemency of death, but hoped for the coming of the girl to release him as she had promised. The long hours passed with a half-delirious tedium; and the cressets, whose flames had been changed to crimson, appeared to fill his eyes with flowing blood; and the dead men and the sea-monsters swam as if in blood beyond the wall of glass. And the girl came not; and Fulbra had begun to despair. Then, at last, he heard the door open gently and not with the harsh clangor that had proclaimed the entrance of his guards.\n\nTurning, he saw the girI, who stole swiftly to his couch with a lifted fingertip, enjoining silence. She told him with soft whispers that her plan had failed; but surely on the following night she would be able to drug the guards and obtain the keys of the outer gates; and Fulbra could escape from the palace to a hidden cove in which a boat with water and provisions lay ready for his use. She prayed him to endure for another day the torments of Ildrac; and to this, perforce, he consented. And he thought that the girl loved him; for tenderly she caressed his feverous brow, and rubbed his torture-burning limbs with a soothing ointment. He deemed that her eyes were soft with a compassion that was more than pity. So Fulbra believed the girl and trusted her, and took heart against the horror of the coming day. Her name, it seemed, was Ilvaa; and her mother was a woman of Yoros who had married one of the evil islanders, choosing this repugnant union as an alternative to the flaying-knives of Ildrac.\n\nToo soon the girl went away, pleading the great danger of discovery, and closed the door softly upon Fulbra. And after a while the king slept; and Ilvaa returned to him anid the delirious abominations of his dreams, and sustained him against the terror of strange hells.\n\nAt dawn the guards came with their hooked weapons, and led him again before Ildrac. And again the brazen, demoniac statue, in a strident voice, announced the fearful ordeals that he was to undergo. And this time he saw that other captives, including the crew and merchants of the galley, were also awaiting the malefic ministrations of the Torturers in the vast hall.\n\nOnce more in the throng of watchers the girl Ilvaa pressed close to him, unreprimanded by his guards, and murmured words of comfort; so that Fulbra was enheartened against the enormities foretold by the brazen oracular image. And indeed a bold and hopeful heart was required to endure the ordeals of that day...\n\nAmong other things less goodly to be mentioned, the Torturers held before Fulbra a mirror of strange wizardry, wherein his own face was reflected as if seen after death. The rigid features, as he gazed upon them, became marked with the green and bluish marbling of corruption; and the withering flesh fell in on the sharp bones, and displayed the visible fretting of the worm. Hearing meanwhile the dolorous groans and agonizing cries of his fellow captives all about the hall, he beheld other faces, dead, swollen, lidless, and flayed, that seemed to approach him from behind and to throng about his own face in the mirror. Their looks were dank and dripping, like the hair of corpses recovered from the sea; and sea-weed was mingled with the locks. Then, turning at a cold and clammy touch, he found that these faces were no illusion but the actual reflection of cadavers drawn from the under-sea by a malign sorcery, that had entered the hall of Ildrac like living men and were peering over his shoulder.\n\nHis own slaves, with flesh that the sea-things had gnawed even to the bone, were among them. And the slaves came toward him with glaring eyes that saw only the voidness of death. And beneath the sorcerous control of Ildrac, their evilly animated corpses began to assail Fulbra, clawing at his face and raiment with half-eaten fingers. And Fulbra, faint with loathing, struggled against his dead slaves, who knew not the voice of their master and were deaf as the wheels and racks of torment used by Ildrac...\n\nAnon the drowned and dripping corpses went away; and Fulbra was stripped by the Torturers and was laid supine on the palace floor, with iron rings that bound him closely to the flags at knee and wrist, at elbow and ankle. Then they brought in the disinterred body of a woman, nearly eaten, in which a myriad maggots swarmed on the uncovered bones and tatters of dark corruption; and this body they placed on the right hand of Fulbra. And also they fetched the carrion of a black goat that was newly touched with beginning decay; and they laid it down beside him on the left hand. Then, across Fulbra, from right to left, the hungry maggots crawled in a long and undulant wave...\n\nAfter the consummation of this torture, there came many others that were equally ingenious and atrocious, and were well designed for the delectation of King Ildrac and his peopIe. And Fulbra endured the tortures valiantly, upheld by the thought of Ilvaa.\n\nVainly, however, on the night that followed this day, he waited in his dungeon for the girl. The cressets burned with a bloodier crimson; and new corpses were among the flayed and floating dead in the sea-cavern; and strange double-bodied serpents of the nether deep arose with an endless squirming; and their horned heads appeared to bloat immeasurably against the crystal wall. Yet the girl Ilvaa came not to free him as she had promised; and the night passed. But though despair resumed its old dominion in the heart of Fulbra, and terror came with talons steeped in fresh venom, he refused to doubt Ilvaa, telling himself that she had been delayed or prevented by some unforeseen mishap.\n\nAt dawn of the third day, he was again taken before Ildrac. The brazen image, announcing the ordeals of the day, told him that he was to be bound on a wheel of adamant; and, lying on the wheel, was to drink a drugged wine that would steal away his royal memories for ever, and would conduct his naked soul on a long pilgrimage through monstrous and infamous hells before bringing it back to the hall of Ildrac and the broken body on the wheel.\n\nThen certain women of the Torturers, laughing obscenely, came forward and bound King Fulbra to the adamantine wheel with thongs of dragon-gut. And after they had done this, the girl Ilvaa, smiling with the shameless exultation of open cruelty, appeared before Fulbra and stood close beside him, holding a golden cup that contained the drugged wine. She mocked him for his folly and credulity in trusting her promises; and the other women and the male Torturers, even to Ildrac on his brazen seat, laughed loudly and evilly at Fulbra, and praised Ilvaa for the perfidy she had practised upon him.\n\nSo Fulbra's heart grew sick with a darker despair then any he had yet known, The brief, piteous love that had been born amid sorrow and agony perished within him, leaving but ashes steeped in gall. Yet, gazing at Ilvaa with sad eyes, he uttered no word of reproach. He wished to live no longer; and yearning for a swift death, he bethought him of the wizard ring of Vemdeez and of that which Vemdeez had said would follow its removal from his finger. He still wore the ring. which the Torturers had deemed a bauble of small value. But his hands were bound tightly to the wheel, and he could not remove it. So, with a bitter cunning, knowing full well that the islanders would not take away the ring if he should offer it to them, he feigned a sudden madness and cried wildly:\n\n'Steal my memories, if ye will, with your accursed wine -and send me through a thousand hells and bring me back again to Uccastrog: but take not the ring that I wear on my middle finger; for it is more precious to me than many kingdoms or the pale breasts of love.'\n\nHearing this, King Ildrac rose from his brazen seat; and bidding IIvaa to delay the administration of the wine, he came forward and inspected curiously the ring of Vemdeez, which gleamed darkly, set with its rayless gem, on Fulbra's finger. And all the while, Fulbra cried out against him in a frenzy, as if fearing that he would take the ring.\n\nSo Ildrac, deeming that he could plague the prisoner thereby and could heighten his suffering a little, did the very thing for which Fulbra had planned. And the ring came easily from the shrunken finger; and Ildrac, wishing to mock the royal captive, placed it on his own middle digit.\n\nThen, while Ildrac regarded the captive with a more deeply graven smile of evil on the pale, gilded mask of his face, there came to King Fulbra of Yoros the dreadful and longed-for thing. The Silver Death, that had slept so long in his body beneath the magical abeyance of the ring of Vemdeez, was made manifest even as he hung on the adamantine wheel. His limbs stiffened with another rigor than that of agony; and his face shone brightly with the coming of the Death; and so he died.\n\nThen, to Ilvaa and to many of the Torturers who stood wondering about the wheel, the chill and instant contagion of the Silver Death was communicated. They fell even where they had stood; and the pestilence remained like a glittering light on the faces and the hands of the men and shone forth from the nude bodies of the women. And the plague passed along the immense hall; and the other captives of King Ildrac were released thereby from their various torments; and the Torturers found surcease from the dire longing that they could assuage only through the pain of their fellowmen. And through all the palace, and throughout the Isle of Uccastrog, the Death flew swiftly, visible in those upon whom it had breathed, but otherwise unseen and inpalpable.\n\nBut Ilrac, wearing the ring of Vemdeez, was immune. And guessing not the reason for his immunity, he beheld with consternation the doom that had overtaken his followers, and watched in stupefaction the freeing of his victims. Then, fearful of some inimic sorcery, he rushed from the hall; and standing in the early sun on a palace-terrace above the sea, he tore the ring of Vemdeez from his finger and hurled it to the foamy billows far below, deeming in his terror that the ring was perhaps the source or agent of the unknown hostile magic.\n\nSo Ildrac, in his turn, when all the others had fallen, was smitten by the Silver Death; and its peace descended upon him where he lay in his robes of blood-brightened purple, with features shining palely to the unclouded sun. And oblivion claimed the Isle of Uccastrog; and the Torturers were one with the tortured.",

"在太阳西沉与东升之间，银色的死亡已降临约洛斯。然而这灾厄早被无数预言所昭示——既有远古的谶语，亦有新近的占卜。星象家们宣称，这种尘世前所未见的诡谲疫病，将从统治着佐西克南方大陆的凶星\"水委一\"降临；当它用闪亮的金属般惨白封印万千血肉之躯后，仍会乘着以太的幽暗洪流，穿越时空扑向其他世界。\n\n银色死亡恐怖绝伦，无人知晓其传染之秘或治愈之法。它如沙漠狂风般迅疾，从已成废墟的塔苏恩王国袭向约洛斯，甚至追上了那些星夜赶来报信的使者。被诅咒者会感到刺骨严寒，瞬间僵直，恍若宇宙最幽邃的深渊向他们呼出寒气。他们的面容与躯体诡异地苍白，泛着死寂光泽，数分钟内便僵硬如陈年古尸。\n\n在希尔彭、西罗亚的街巷，以及约洛斯都城法拉德的鎏金灯下，瘟疫如同幽光在人群间流转。受害者们当场倒地而亡，可怖的惨白却永远凝固在他们身上。喧嚣的狂欢节庆在瘟疫过处戛然而止，寻欢作乐者保持着嬉闹的姿态僵立。华宅中的宴饮者于觥筹交错间面色骤变，瘫坐在镶金椅中，僵直的手指仍攥着半倾的酒杯。商贾倒毙在待清点的钱堆上，后来潜入的盗贼亦无法带着赃物离开。掘墓人死在为他人挖掘的墓穴里，再无人来争夺这些葬身之所。\n\n在这诡异而无可逃避的天罚面前，逃亡已成徒劳。清朗星空下，它可怖而迅猛地吞噬了约洛斯，黎明时分还能苏醒者寥寥无几。新近登基的年轻君主富尔布拉，此刻俨然成了没有臣民的国王。\n\n疫病降临之夜，富尔布拉正独坐皇宫高塔——这座配备天文仪器的观星台俯瞰着法拉德城。沉重预感压迫着他的心脏，鸦片般的绝望钝化了思绪，却驱不散清醒的煎熬。他早已知晓关于银色死亡的诸多预言，更在老占星师兼巫师文迪兹协助下，从星象中读出了迫近的灾祸。他与文迪兹心照不宣地保守着这个秘密，因他们深知约洛斯的命运早已被永恒法则注定，凡人唯有在命定其他死法时才能逃脱此劫。\n\n文迪兹曾为富尔布拉占卜星盘。尽管某些晦涩之处超出他的学识范畴，但国王不会死于约洛斯的预言清晰可辨。至于殒命之地与方式，则同样难以参透。这位侍奉过先王阿尔塔斯的老巫师，如今对新君同样忠诚。他施法打造了一枚能永远抵御银色死亡的魔戒。这枚指环以暗红金属铸成，色泽深于赤金与青铜，镶嵌着凡间宝石匠从未见过的黑色长方宝石，永恒散发着浓郁的异香。巫师告诫富尔布拉永远不可摘下戴在中指的戒指——即便远离约洛斯，即便瘟疫消退之后——因一旦被瘟疫侵蚀，其诅咒将永世潜伏血肉之中，摘戒之时便是诅咒复苏之刻。但文迪兹未提及红金属与黑宝石的来历，亦未言明获得这种防护魔法付出的代价。\n\n富尔布拉怀着沉痛戴上戒指。当银色死亡的气息掠过夜空时，他因此得以幸免。但在高塔焦灼守望的他，凝望法拉德城的金辉而非那些冷酷星辰时，仍感受到一丝不属于夏夜的寒意。就在寒意掠过刹那，城中欢闹骤然沉寂，呜咽的鲁特琴声诡异地中断。死寂笼罩了狂欢节庆，部分灯火熄灭后再未点燃。脚下皇宫同样陷入静默，再也听不见侍从与内臣的笑语。惯常在午夜登塔相伴的文迪兹亦未现身。富尔布拉明白自己已成亡国之君，对先王阿尔塔斯的哀思此刻更因举国殒灭而愈发沉重。\n\n他纹丝不动地呆坐数小时，悲恸得流不出泪。星空流转，水委一星如嘲弄的恶魔之眼永恒闪烁。黑宝石戒指散发的浓重香气钻入鼻腔，几令他窒息。富尔布拉一度想摘下戒指，像臣民般死去。但连这般决绝也被绝望压制。最终，黎明如银色死亡般苍白的曙光爬上天空，发现他仍在塔顶伫立。\n\n晨光中，国王起身沿斑岩旋梯下塔。阶梯中段躺着老巫师文迪兹的尸体——他登塔途中便已殒命。文迪兹布满皱纹的脸庞如抛光金属，比须发更为惨白；那双曾似蓝宝石般深邃的眼睛，如今覆满瘟疫的冰霜。国王如丧慈父般悲痛，继续缓步下行。在底层厅室中，他见到横陈的廷臣、仆役与卫兵尸骸。唯余三名奴隶幸存——他们守卫着深宫底层青铜绿门的密室。\n\n此刻富尔布拉想起文迪兹的谏言：逃离约洛斯，前往朝贡属国辛特罗姆岛避难。虽万念俱灰，他仍命奴隶收集远航所需物资，搬进停泊在沃姆河宫廊的乌木御舟。登船后，他亲自掌舵，令奴隶展开琥珀色巨帆。御舟驶过遍布银色尸骸的庄严都城，进入沃姆河渐阔的碧玉色河口，最终航向因达斯海永不凋谢的紫红海湾。\n\n顺风自北方吹来，掠过荒芜的塔苏恩与约洛斯，恰如银色死亡夜袭时的轨迹。沃姆河上，无数船员尽殁的船只随波漂向大海。法拉德城静若古墓，河口两岸唯有羽状扇椰在渐强的南风中摇曳。很快，约洛斯的翠绿海岸带着蔚蓝远影与朦胧梦境渐渐消失。\n\n在盛夏骄阳下，平静的海面泛着酒沫般的白浪，充满奇异的呢喃与异域传说。但海妖的絮语与悠长摇篮般的抚慰，无法平息富尔布拉的哀伤。他心中的绝望如同文迪兹红戒上的黑宝石般幽暗。\n\n尽管如此，他仍紧握乌木舟巨舵，竭力凭日影直航辛特罗姆。琥珀帆在顺风中紧绷，舟首乌木女神像整日劈开紫红海浪。当南天熟悉的星辰浮现夜幕，富尔布拉得以修正航向偏差。\n\n连续多日南行，身后太阳渐低，新星簇拥在舟首黑女神像周围。幼时曾随父王阿尔塔斯航向辛特罗姆的富尔布拉，期盼很快能望见樟脑与檀香木海岸浮现在酒色深海之上。但他心中毫无欢愉，忆及昔日父子同航常令他泪眼模糊。\n\n正午时分，无风的窒息突然降临，海水在舟侧凝成紫晶。苍穹化作低垂的黄铜穹顶，旋即被邪术催生的黑夜笼罩。暴风如群魔汇聚的吐息掀起山峦般的巨浪，乌木桅杆芦苇般折断，船帆撕成碎片。孤舟在黑暗浪谷中颠簸，时而坠入深渊，时而被盲目的泡沫帷幕抛向浪巅。\n\n富尔布拉紧攥失效的舵轮，命奴隶躲进前舱。在狂怒飓风摆布下，他数小时只见苍白的浪峰在幽暗中隐现，完全迷失了航向。\n\n诡异暮色里，他瞥见不远处有艘同样受风暴摆布的船只——似是商贾用于南海诸岛贸易的桨帆船，但多数船桨已断，倾倒的桅帆垂在船首。两船并行良久，直到阴霾裂隙间浮现嶙峋礁石与后方苍白的尖塔群。无法转舵的轻舟与那艘船冲向礁岩，眼看就要撞得粉碎。但仿佛被施了魔法，风暴忽如兴起时那般骤歇。晴空倾泻宁静阳光，乌木舟停泊在赭黄新月形沙滩上，那艘桨帆船亦安然在侧。\n\n富尔布拉晕眩地倚着舵轮，奴隶战战兢兢爬出船舱。桨帆船上渐现人影，国王正欲招呼那些水手与富商打扮的幸存者，忽闻头顶传来尖利邪异的笑声。他抬头看见崖壁阶梯涌下人群——他们裹着血红色奇异头巾，身穿紧身黑袍，肤如番红花般蜡黄，无睫毛的眼睑下嵌着斜视的灰白眼珠，薄唇永远挂着弯刀般的诡笑。\n\n这群人手持锯齿剑与双头矛等凶器。部分人向富尔布拉卑躬行礼，却用莫测的目光紧盯他。他们嘶嘶作响的语言比外貌更古怪，国王与奴隶皆不解其意。富尔布拉以约洛斯优雅语系礼貌询问这片风暴抛舟之地的名称。\n\n某些人似乎听懂了，灰白眼珠闪过异光。一人用支离破碎的约洛斯语回答：\"此乃乌卡斯特罗格岛。\"随即，他笑容里渗出隐秘恶意，补充说所有遇难水手都会受到伊尔德拉克国王的热情款待。\n\n富尔布拉闻言心沉谷底。他早听过关于乌卡斯特罗格的可怕传闻——这座位于辛特罗姆以东的岛屿以\"拷问者之岛\"闻名。据说误入者皆被岛民囚禁，遭受无穷尽酷刑折磨，而施刑正是这些残忍生灵的最大乐趣。传言无人能逃离此岛，许多囚徒在地牢与刑讯室存活多年，供伊尔德拉克君臣取乐。更有人相信拷问者精通妖法，能召唤风暴使船只偏离航线，再将其抛上海岸。\n\n见黄肤人已包围轻舟，富尔布拉要求即刻觐见伊尔德拉克。他打算表明王族身份，天真地认为君主之间不至相互折磨。或许旅行者的传闻也有夸大之处。\n\n国王与奴隶被押往海滩峭壁上的王宫。攀爬石阶时，下方突然传来兵刃交击与喊叫——搁浅桨帆船的船员正与岛民厮杀。但寡不敌众，多数人被生擒。此景令富尔布拉忧惧更深。\n\n不久，他们来到宫殿大厅。端坐青铜高椅的伊尔德拉克比臣民高出半头，面容如鎏金邪魔面具，身着海紫色长袍，衣褶间似有鲜血流动。卫兵手持镰状凶器，穿朱红短裙与青金石胸罩的斜眼侍女在玄武岩柱间穿梭。厅内陈列着富尔布拉从未见过的可怖刑具：带着铁齿床的重型锁链、鱼皮绳索与滑轮机构。\n\n约洛斯年轻君主昂首上前，向纹丝不动的伊尔德拉克自报家门，陈述逃亡缘由及前往辛特罗姆的迫切愿望。\n\n\"辛特罗姆路途遥远。\"伊尔德拉克露出微妙笑容，\"况且让贵客未享尽乌卡斯特罗格款待便离开，实在有违待客之道。富尔布拉国王，请您暂且按捺焦躁。我们有许多奇观供您观赏，诸多娱乐邀您体验。内臣将引您前往配得上王室的居所。但首先，请留下佩剑——剑刃锋利，我不愿贵客被自己的武器所伤。\"\n\n于是，福尔布拉的佩剑被一名宫廷侍卫夺走；他随身携带的镶红宝石匕首亦遭收缴。数名侍卫手持镰刃兵器将他团团围住，押着他穿过厅堂，经由无数回廊与盘旋向下的阶梯，深入王宫底部松软的岩层。他无从知晓三名奴隶的下落，亦不知桨帆船被俘船员们的命运。很快，日光从他视野中消失，取而代之的是铜灯盏里硫磺色火焰照亮的幽深洞窟；四周隐蔽的囚室中，凄厉呻吟与癫狂嚎叫声不绝于耳，仿佛正撞击着金刚石门扉又渐渐衰竭。\n\n在某处洞厅中，福尔布拉与押解者遇见一位面容姣好、不似他人般阴郁的少女。经过时，福尔布拉觉得少女向他投来怜悯的微笑；她似乎用约罗斯语轻声呢喃：\"振作些，福尔布拉王，有人愿助你脱困。\"侍卫们显然未留意或听不懂这番话——他们只懂乌卡斯特罗格岛民粗粝嘶哑的方言。\n\n走下无数阶梯后，他们来到一扇沉重的青铜巨门前。侍卫开锁逼他入内，门扇在身后发出哀鸣般的轰响。这间囚室三面以岛上黑岩砌成，第四面则是坚不可摧的厚玻璃墙。透过玻璃，他看见悬挂灯盏映照下幽蓝发绿的海水，其中巨型章鱼的触须正沿玻璃蠕动，黄金鳞片的巨蟒在暗处盘绕，更有被切除眼睑的浮尸正用裸露的眼球凝视着他。\n\n地牢角落靠近玻璃墙处摆着一张木榻，木制器皿盛放着饮食。精疲力竭的国王未碰食物便颓然躺下。当死尸与海怪借着灯火窥视时，他紧闭双眼试图忘却悲痛与迫近的厄运。在恐惧与哀伤的迷雾中，少女慈悲的面容不断浮现——她是在乌卡斯特罗格唯一对他流露善意的人。那面容带着温柔的萦绕与魔力，使久违的青春悸动与模糊求生欲在他心底苏醒。最终他沉入梦乡，梦中少女容颜依旧。\n\n醒来时灯火未熄，玻璃墙外仍是群魔乱舞的海底世界。但浮尸中新增了他那遭岛民酷刑折磨后抛入海底洞窟的奴隶——专为让他醒来目睹。正当他被这景象折磨得几欲作呕时，青铜门发出沉闷的摩擦声，侍卫持弯刀威逼他进食饮水后，将他押往伊尔德拉克王的酷刑大厅。\n\n透过宫窗的晨光与刑具投下的长影，福尔布拉判断此刻是黎明。大厅挤满行刑者及其女伴，他们正进行着不祥的准备。一尊面容如冥神般凶恶的青铜巨像矗立在王座右侧。当伊尔德拉克露出狡黠微笑时，铜像竟用约罗斯语尖厉地宣布了当日将施行的种种地狱酷刑。\n\n此时福尔布拉耳畔响起轻柔低语——正是先前邂逅的少女。在行刑者视若无睹中，她悄声道：\"勇敢承受今日苦难，我必在明日黎明前救你脱困。\"这番话使爱与生的双重渴望在他心中奇异复苏，成为对抗酷刑的精神支柱。\n\n关于伊尔德拉克及其臣民施加的暴行，实不宜详述。乌卡斯特罗岛民精通折磨五感的诡谲手段，更能摧残神智至疯狂不及的境地，甚至玷污记忆中最珍贵的珍宝。\n\n当日他们未施极刑，却用刺耳魔音折磨福尔布拉的耳膜：令血液凝结的邪恶笛声、震颤脏腑的低沉鼓点、钻入骨髓的尖锐铃鼓。接着逼他吸入龙胆与食人族尸蜡混合恶木燃烧的毒烟，待火势减弱又添入吸血蝠油。当酸蚀丝绸腰带灼烧他的皮肤，当毛虫般布满黑毛的幼蛇用百万根毒针刺入他四肢时，福尔布拉的惨叫响彻厅堂。\n\n伊尔德拉克王带着可怖的餍足感观赏这一切。见福尔布拉濒临崩溃，他们将其押回地牢。在疼痛与恐惧的煎熬中，国王不再渴求死亡的仁慈，只期盼少女如约而至。当血红色灯火将玻璃外的浮尸与海怪映得如同血海时，少女终于悄然现身。\n\n她低声告知计划受阻，但承诺次日必用迷药取得钥匙，助他逃往藏有补给小船的隐秘海湾。她为福尔布拉涂抹镇痛药膏，指尖抚过他滚烫的额头。她自称伊尔瓦，母亲是为逃避剥皮酷刑而委身岛民的约罗斯女子。匆匆离去前，她再度潜入福尔布拉的梦魇，成为抵御地狱幻象的支柱。\n\n第三日黎明，青铜像宣布将用魔药抹去福尔布拉所有记忆，使其灵魂堕入万劫不复的地狱之旅。当行刑者将他绑上金刚石巨轮时，伊尔瓦手持金杯现身，脸上挂着残忍的得意笑容。她嘲笑国王的轻信，众人为这场背叛哄堂大笑。\n\n此刻福尔布拉心中腾起比任何酷刑更黑暗的绝望。他沉默凝视伊尔瓦，突然佯装癫狂大喊：\"尽管用毒酒夺我记忆，送我遍历千重地狱——但休想夺走我中指这枚戒指！它比王座与爱情更珍贵！\"\n\n伊尔德拉克果然中计，起身查看文德兹法师那枚镶嵌无光宝石的戒指。福尔布拉继续疯喊阻止，暗中等待时机。当国王手指触碰到戒指时，一道黑紫色闪电突然自宝石迸射，击碎了青铜巨像的头颅。整个大厅在剧烈震动中崩塌，海水从四面八方涌入。在最后的清醒时刻，福尔布拉看见伊尔瓦被倒塌的铜柱压成肉泥，而自己随着漩涡沉向无底深渊......\n\n于是，伊尔德拉克认定此举既能折磨囚徒又可加剧其苦楚，便顺遂了富尔布拉的谋划。那枚戒指轻易便从萎缩的手指滑落；怀着嘲弄这位王室俘虏的恶意，伊尔德拉克将它戴在了自己的中指上。\n\n当伊尔德拉克苍白鎏金面具上的邪笑愈发深刻，凝视着阶下囚时，约罗斯国王富尔布拉终于迎来了那恐怖而渴求的宿命。在维姆迪兹戒指的魔法压制下蛰伏已久的银色死亡，此刻随着他被绑在精钢巨轮上的身躯骤然显现。他的四肢在超越剧痛的僵直中凝固，面容因死亡的降临而泛出诡异光芒，就此气绝身亡。\n\n紧接着，银色死亡的凛冽瘟疫瞬间席卷了围在巨轮旁瞠目结舌的伊尔瓦与众多拷问者。他们当场倒地毙命，瘟疫如磷火般在男人们的面庞与手掌上闪烁，从女人们赤裸的躯体中透出寒光。疫病横扫宏伟厅堂，伊尔德拉克的其他俘虏因此摆脱了种种酷刑；而那些以他人痛苦为食的拷问者们，终于从永无止境的施虐渴望中获得解脱。死亡在整座宫殿乃至乌卡斯特罗格岛急速蔓延，唯有被它亲吻过的躯体才能昭示其存在，除此之外无形无质。\n\n但戴着维姆迪兹戒指的伊尔拉克却安然无恙。他茫然不解自己为何幸免，惊惶注视着追随者们相继倒毙，呆望着囚徒们重获自由。恐惧某种敌对巫术的他冲出大厅，站在临海的宫殿露台上，迎着初升朝阳将维姆迪兹戒指扯下，掷入下方翻腾的浪涛——惊骇中他认定这枚戒指正是未知邪术的根源。\n\n当所有人皆已倒下，轮到的伊尔德拉克终被银色死亡击中；他躺在被鲜血染成绛紫的华袍中，面容在无云晴空下泛着死寂的苍白，迎来了永恒的安眠。乌卡斯特罗格岛沉入遗忘之境，施虐者与受刑者终归一体。"

        "content": "\n\n\"Mordiggian is the god of Zul-Bha-Sair,\" said the innkeeper with unctuous solemnity. \"He has been the god from years that are lost to man's memory in shadow deeper than the subterranes of his black temple. There is no other god in Zul-Bha-Sair. And all who die within the walls of the city are sacred to Mordiggian. Even the kings and the optimates, at death, are delivered into the hands of his muffled priests. It is the law and the custom. A little while, and the priests will come for your bride.\"\n\n\"But Elaith is not dead,\" protested the youth Phariom for the third or fourth time, in piteous desperation. \"Her malady is one that assumes the lying likeness of death. Twice before has she lain insensible, with a pallor upon her cheeks and a stillness in her very blood, that could hardly be distinguished from those of the tomb; and twice she has awakened after an interim of days.\"\n\nThe innkeeper peered with an air of ponderous unbelief at the girl who lay white and motionless as a mown lily on the bed in the poorly furnished attic chamber.\n\n\"In that case you should not have brought her into Zul-Bha-Sair,\" he averred in a tone of owlish irony. \"The physician has pronounced her dead; and her death has been reported to the priests. She must go to the temple of Mordiggian.\"\n\n\"But we are outlanders, guests of a night. We have come from the land of Xylac, far in the north; and this morning we should have gone on through Tasuun, toward Pharaad, the capital of Yoros, which lies near to the southern sea. Surely your god could have no claim upon Elaith, even if she were truly dead.\"\n\n\"All who die in Zul-Bha-Sair are the property of Mordiggian,\" insisted the taverner sententiously. \"Outlanders are not exempt. The dark maw of his temple yawns eternally, and no man, no child, no woman, throughout the years, has evaded its yawning. All mortal flesh must become, in due time, the provender of the god.\"\n\nPhariom shuddered at the oily and portentous declaration.\n\n\"Dimly have I heard of Mordiggian, as a legend that travellers tell in Xylac,\" he admitted. \"But I had forgotten the name of his city; and Elaith and I came ignorantly into Zul-Bha-Sair... Even had I known, I should have doubted the terrible custom of which you inform me. ...What manner of deity is this, who imitates the hyena and the vulture? Surely he is no god, but a ghoul.\"\n\n\"Take heed lest you utter blasphemy,\" admonished the innkeeper. \"Mordiggian is old and omnipotent as death. He was worshipped in former continents, before the lifting of Zothique from out the sea. Through him, we are saved from corruption and the worm. Even as the people of other places devote their dead to the consuming flame, so we of Zul-Bha-Sair deliver ours to the god. Awful is the fane, a place of terror and obscure shadow untrod by the sun, into which the dead are borne by his priests and are laid on a vast table of stone to await his coming from the nether vault in which he dwells. No living men, other than the priests, have ever beheld him; and the faces of the priests are hidden behind masks of silver, and even their hands are shrouded, that men may not gaze on them that have seen Mordiggian.\"\n\n\"But there is a king in Zul-Bha-Sair, is there not? I shall appeal to him against this heinous and horrible injustice. Surely he will heed me.\"\n\n\"Phenquor is the king; but he could not help you even if he wished. Your appeal will not even be heard. Mordiggian is above all kings, and his law is sacred. Hark! — for already the priests come.\"\n\nPhariom, sick at heart with the charnel terror and cruelty of the doom that impended for his girlish wife in this unknown city of nightmare, heard an evil, stealthy creaking on the stairs that led to the attic of the inn. The sound drew nearer with inhuman rapidity, and four strange figures came into the room, heavily garbed in funereal purple, and wearing huge masks of silver graven in the likeness of skulls. It was impossible to surmise their actual appearance, for, even as the taverner had hinted, their very hands were concealed by fingerless gloves; and the purple gowns came down in loose folds that trailed about their feet like unwinding cerecloths. There was a horror about them, of which the macabre masks were only a lesser element; a horror that lay partly in their unnatural, crouching attitudes, and the beastlike agility with which they moved, unhampered by their cumbrous habiliments.\n\nAmong them, they carried a curious bier, made from interwoven strips of leather, and with monstrous bones that served for frame and handles. The leather was greasy and blackened as if from long years of mortuary use. Without speaking to Phariom or the innkeeper, and with no delay or formality of any sort, they advanced toward the bed on which Elaith was lying.\n\nUndeterred by their more than formidable aspect, and wholly distraught with grief and anger, Phariom drew from his girdle a short knife, the only weapon he possessed. Disregarding the minatory cry of the taverner, he rushed wildly upon the muffled figures. He was quick and muscular, and, moreover, was clad in light, close-fitting raiment, such as would seemingly have given him a brief advantage.\n\nThe priests had turned their backs upon him; but, as if they had foreseen his every action, two of them wheeled about with the swiftness of tigers, dropping the handles of bone that they carried. One of them struck the knife from Phariom's hand with a movement that the eye could barely follow in its snaky darting. Then both assailed him, beating him back with terrible flailing blows of their shrouded arms, and hurling him half across the room into an empty corner. Stunned by his fall, he lay senseless for a term of minutes.\n\nRecovering glazedly, with eyes that blurred as he opened them, he beheld the fact of the stout taverner stooping above him like a tallow-colored moon. The thought of Elaith, more sharp than the thrust of a dagger, brought him back to agonizing consciousness. Fearfully he scanned the shadowy room, and, saw that the ceremented priests were gone, that the bed was vacant. He heard the orotund and sepulchral croaking of the taverner.\n\n\"The priests of Mordiggian are merciful, they make allowance for the frenzy and distraction of the newly bereaved. It is well for you that they are compassionate, and considerate of mortal weakness.\"\n\nPhariom sprang erect, as if his bruised and aching body were scorched by a sudden fire. Pausing only to retrieve his knife, which still lay in the middle of the room, he started toward the door. He was stopped by the hand of the hosteler, clutching greasily at his shoulder.\n\n\"Beware, lest you exceed the bounds of the mercy of Mordiggian. It is an ill thing to follow his priests — and a worse thing to intrude upon the deathly and sacred gloom of his temple.\"\n\nPhariom scarcely heard the admonition. He wrenched himself hastily away from the odious fingers and turned to go; but again the hand clutched him.\n\n\"At least, pay me the money that you owe for food and lodging, ere you depart,\" demanded the innkeeper. \"Also, there is the matter of the physician's fee, which I can settle for you, if you will entrust me with the proper sum. Pay now — for there is no surety that you will return.\"\n\nPhariom drew out the purse that contained his entire worldly wealth, and filled the greedily cupped palm before him with coins that he did not pause to count. With no parting word or backward glance, he descended the moldy and musty stairs of the worm-eaten hostelry, as if spurred by an incubus, and went out into the gloomy, serpentine streets of Zul-Bha-Sair.\n\nPerhaps the city differed little from others, except in being older and darker; but to Phariom, in his extremity of anguish, the ways that he followed were like subterrene corridors that led only to some profound and monstrous charnel. The sun had risen above the overjutting houses, but it seemed to him that there was no light, other than a lost and doleful glimmering such as might descend into mortuary depths. The people, it may have been, were much like other people, but he saw them under a malefic aspect, as if they were ghouls and demons that went to and fro on the ghastly errands of a necropolis.\n\nBitterly, in his distraction, he recalled the previous evening, when he had entered Zul-Bha-Sair at twilight with Elaith, the girl riding on the one dromedary that had survived their passage of the northern desert, and he walking beside her, weary but content. With the rosy purple of afterglow upon its walls and cupolas, with the deepening golden eyes of its lit windows, the place had seemed a fair and nameless city of dreams, and they had planned to rest there for a day or two before resuming the long, arduous journey to Pharaad, in Yoros.\n\nThis journey had been undertaken only through necessity. Phariom, an impoverished youth of noble blood, had been exiled because of the political and religious tenets of his family, which were not in accord with those of the reigning emperor, Caleppos. Taking his newly wedded wife, Phariom had set out for Yoros, where certain allied branches of the house to which he belonged had already established themselves, and would give him a fraternal welcome.\n\nThey had travelled with a large caravan of merchants, going directly southward to Tasuun. Beyond the borders of Xylac, amid the red sands of the Celotian waste, the caravan had been attacked by robbers, who had slain many of its members and dispersed the rest. Phariom and his bride, escaping with their dromedaries, had found themselves lost and alone in the desert, and, failing to regain the road toward Tasuun, had taken inadvertently another track, leading to Zul-Bha-Sair, a walled metropolis on the south-western verge of the waste, which their itinerary had not included.\n\nEntering Zul-Bha-Sair, the couple had repaired for reasons of economy to a tavern in the humbler quarter. There, during the night, Elaith had been overcome by the third seizure of the cataleptic malady to which she was liable. The earlier seizures, occurring before her marriage to Phariom, had been recognized in their true character by the physicians of Xylac, and had been palliated by skillful treatment. It was hoped that the malady would not recur. The third attack, no doubt, had been induced by the fatigues and hardships of the journey. Phariom had felt sure that Elaith would recover, but a doctor of Zul-Bha-Sair, hastily summoned by the innkeeper, had insisted that she was actually dead; and, in obedience to the strange law of the city, had reported her without delay to the priests of Mordiggian. The frantic protests of the husband had been utterly ignored.\n\nThere was, it seemed, a diabolic fatality about the whole train of circumstances through which Elaith, still living, though with that outward aspect of the tomb which her illness involved, had fallen into the grasp of the devotees of the charnel god. Phariom pondered this fatality almost to madness, as he strode with furious, aimless haste along the eternally winding and crowded streets.\n\nTo the cheerless information received from the taverner, he added, as he went on, more and more of the tardily remembered legends which he had heard in Xylac. Ill and dubious indeed was the renown of Zul-Bha-Sair, and he marvelled that he should have forgotten it, and cursed himself with black curses for the temporary but fatal forgetfulness. Better would it have been if he and Elaith had perished in the desert, rather than enter the wide gates that stood always open, gaping for their prey, as was the custom of Zul-Bha-Sair.\n\nThe city was a mart of trade, where outland travelers came, but did not care to linger, because of the repulsive cult of Mordiggian, the invisible eater of the dead, who was believed to share his provender with the shrouded priests. It was said that the bodies lay for days in the dark temple and were not devoured till corruption had begun. And people whispered of fouler things than necrophagism, of blasphemous rites that were solemnized in the ghoul-ridden vaults, and nameless uses to which the dead were put before Mordiggian claimed them. In all outlying places, the fate of those who died in Zul-Bha-Sair was a dreadful byword and a malediction. But to the people of that city, reared in the faith of the ghoulish god, it was merely the usual and expected mode of mortuary disposal. Tombs, graves, catacombs, funeral pyres, and other such nuisances, were rendered needless by this highly utilitarian deity.\n\nPhariom was surprised to see the people of the city going about the common businesses of life. Porters were passing with bales of household goods upon their shoulders. Merchants were squatting in their shops like other merchants. Buyers and sellers chaffered loudly in the public bazaars. Women laughed and chattered in the door ways. Only by their voluminous robes of red, black and violet, and their strange, uncouth accents, was he able to distinguish the men of Zul-Bha-Sair from those who were outlanders like himself. The murk of nightmare began to lift from his impressioms; and gradually, as he went on, the spectacle of everyday humanity all about him helped to calm a little his wild distraction and desperation. Nothing could dissipate the horror of his loss, and the abominable fate that threatened Elaith. But now, with a cool logic born of the cruel exigence, he began to consider the apparently hopeless problem of rescuing her from the ghoul god's temple.\n\nHe composed his features, and constrained his febrile pacing to an idle saunter, so that none might guess the preoccupations that racked him inwardly. Pretending to be interested in the wares of a seller of men's apparel, he drew the dealer into converse regarding Zul-Bha-Sair and its customs, and made such inquiries as a traveler from far lands might make. The dealer was talkative, and Phariom soon learned from him the location of the temple of Mordiggian, which stood at the city's core. He also learned that the temple was open at all hours, and that people were free to come and go within its precincts. There were, however, no rituals of worship, other than certain private rites that were celebrated by the priesthood. Few cared to enter the fane, because of a superstition that any living person who intruded upon its gloom would return to it shortly as the provender of the god.\n\nMordiggian, it seemed, was a benign deity in the eyes of the inhabitants of Zul-Bha-Sair. Curiously enough, no definite personal attributes were ascribed to him. He was, so to speak, an impersonal force akin to the elements — a consuming and cleansing power, like fire. His hierophants were equally mysterious; they lived at the temple and emerged from it only in the execution of their funeral duties. No one knew the manner of their recruiting, but many believed that they were both male and female, thus renewing their numbers from generation to generation with no ulterior commerce. Others thought that they were not human beings at all, but an order of subterranean earth-entities, who lived for ever, and who fed upon corpses like the god himself. Through this latter belief, of late years, a minor heresy had risen, some holding that Mordiggian was a mere hieratic figment, and the priests were the sole devourers of the dead. The dealer, quoting this heresy, made haste to disavow it with pious reprobation.\n\nPhariom chatted for awhile on other topics, and then continued his progress through the city, going as forthrightly toward the temple as the obliquely running thoroughfares would permit. He had formed no conscious plan, but desired to reconnoiter the vicinage. In that which the garment-dealer had told him, the one reassuring detail was the openness of the fane and its accessibility to all who dared enter. The rarity of visitors, however, would make Phariom conspicuous, and he wished above all to avoid attention. On the other hand, any effort to remove bodies from the temple was seemingly unheard of — a thing audacious beyond the dreams of the people of Zul-Bha-Sair. Through the very boldness of his design, he might avoid suspicion, and succeed in rescuing Elaith.\n\nThe streets that he followed began to tend downward, and were narrower, dimmer and more tortuous than any he had yet traversed. He thought for awhile that he had lost his way, and he was about to ask the passersby to redirect him, when four of the priests of Mordiggian, bearing one of the curious litter-like biers of bone and leather, emerged from an ancient alley just before him.\n\nThe bier was occupied by the body of a girl, and for one moment of convulsive shock and agitation that left him trembling, Phariom thought that the girl was Elaith. Looking again, he saw his mistake. The gown that the girl wore, though simple, was made of some rare exotic stuff. Her features, though pale as those of Elaith, were crowned with curls like the petals of heavy black poppies. Her beauty, warm and voluptuous even in death, differed from the blond pureness of Elaith as tropic lilies differ from narcissi.\n\nQuietly, and maintaining a discreet interval, Phariom followed the sullenly shrouded figures and their lovely burden. He saw that people made way for the passage of the bier with awed, unquestioning alacrity; and the loud voices of hucksters and chafferers were hushed as the priests went by. Overhearing a murmured conversation between two of the townsfolk, he learned that the dead girl was Arctela, daughter of Quaos, a high noble and magistrate of Zul-Bha-Sair. She had died very quickly and mysteriously, from a cause unknown to the physicians, which had not marred or wasted her beauty in the least. There were those who held that an indetectable poison, rather than disease, had been the agency of death; and others deemed her the victim of malefic sorcery.\n\nThe priests went on, and Phariom kept them in sight as well as he could in the blind tangle of streets. The way steepened, without affording any clear prospect of the levels below, and the houses seemed to crowd more closely, as if huddling back from a precipice. Finally the youth emerged behind his macabre guides in a sort of circular hollow at the city's heart, where the temple of Mordiggian loomed alone and separate amid pavements of sad onyx, and funerary cedars whose green had blackened as if with the undeparting charnel shadows bequeathed by dead ages.\n\nThe edifice was built of a strange stone, hued as with the blackish purple of carnal decay: a stone that refused the ardent luster of noon, and the prodigality of dawn or sunset glory. It was low and windowless, having the form of a monstrous mausoleum. Its portals yawned sepulchrally in the gloom of the cedars.\n\nPhariom watched the priests as they vanished within the portals, carrying the girl Arctela like phantoms who bear a phantom burden. The broad area of pavement between the recoiling houses and the temple was now deserted, but he did not venture to cross it in the blare of betraying daylight. Circling the area, he saw that there were several other entrances to the great fane, all open and unguarded. There was no sign of activity about the place; but he shuddered at the thought of that which was hidden within its walls, even as the feasting of worms is hidden in the marble tomb.\n\nLike a vomiting of charnels, the abominations of which he had heard rose up before him in the sunlight; and again he drew close to madness, knowing that Elaith must lie among the dead, in the temple, with the foul umbrage of such things upon her, and that he, consumed with unremitting frenzy, must wait for the favorable shrouding of darkness before he could execute his nebulous, doubtful plan of rescue. In the meanwhile, she might awake, and perish from the mortal horror of her surroundings... or worse even than this might befall, if the whispered tales were true...\n\nAbnon-Tha, sorcerer and necromancer, was felicitating himself on the bargain he had made with the priests of Mordiggian. He felt, perhaps justly, that no one less clever than he could have conceived and executed the various procedures that had made possible this bargain, through which Arctela, daughter of the proud Quaos, would became his unquestioning slave. No other lover, he told himself, could have been resourceful enough to obtain a desired woman in this fashion. Arctela, betrothed to Alos, a young noble of the city, was seemingly beyond the aspiration of a sorcerer. Abnon-Tha, however, was no common hedge-wizard, but an adept of long standing in the most awful and profound arcana of the black arts. He knew the spells that kill more quickly and surely than knife or poison, at a distance; and he knew also the darker spells by which the dead can be reanimated, even after years or ages of decay. He had slain Arctela in a manner that none could detect, with a rare and subtle invultuation that had left no mark; and her body lay now among the dead, in Mordiggian's temple. Tonight, with the tacit connivance of the terrible, shrouded priests, he would bring her back to life.\n\nAbnon-Tha was not native to Zul-Bha-Sair, but had come many years before from the infamous, half-mythic isle of Sotar, lying somewhere to the east of the huge continent of Zothique. Like a sleek young vulture, he had established himself in the very shadow of the charnel fane, and had prospered, taking to himself pupils and assistants.\n\nHis dealings with the priests were long and extensive, and the bargain he had just made was far from being the first of its kind. They had allowed him the temporary use of bodies claimed by Mordiggian, stipulating only that these bodies should not be removed from the temple during the course of any of his experiments in necromancy. Since the privilege was slightly irregular from their viewpoint, he had found it necessary to bribe them — not, however, with gold, but with the promise of a liberal purveyance of matters more sinister and corruptible than gold. The arrangement had been satisfactory enough to all concerned: cadavers had poured into the temple with more than their usual abundance ever since the coming of the sorcerer; the god had not lacked for provender; and Abnon-Tha had never lacked for subjects on which to employ his more baleful spells.\n\nOn the whole, Abnon-Tha was not ill-pleased with himself. He reflected, moreover, that, aside from his mastery of magic and his sleightful ingenuity, he was about to manifest a well-nigh unexampled courage. He had planned a robbery that would amount to dire sacrilege: the removal of the reanimated body of Arctela from the temple. Such robberies (either of animate or exanimate corpses) and the penalty attached to them, were a matter of legend only; for none had occurred in recent ages. Thrice terrible, according to common belief, was the doom of those who had tried and failed. The necromancer was not blind to the risks of his enterprise; nor, on the other hand, was he deterred or intimidated by them.\n\nHis two assistants, Narghai and Vemba-Tsith, apprised of his intention, had made with all due privity the necessary preparations for their flight from Zul-Bha-Sair. The strong passion that the sorcerer had conceived for Arctela was not his only motive, perhaps, in removing from that city. He was desirous of change, for he had grown a little weary of the odd laws that really served to restrict his necromantic practices, while facilitating them in a sense. He planned to travel southward, and establish himself in one of the cities of Tasuun, an empire famous for the number and antiquity of its mummies.\n\nIt was now sunset-time. Five dromedaries, bred for racing, waited in the inner courtyard of Abnon-Tha's house, a high and moldering mansion that seemed to lean forward upon the open, circular area belonging to the temple. One of the dromedaries would carry a bale containing the sorcerer's most valuable books, manuscripts, and other impedimenta of magic. Its fellows would bear Abnon-Tha, the two assistants — and Arctela.\n\nNarghai and Vemba-Tsith appeared before their master to tell him that all was made ready. Both were much younger than Abnon-Tha; but, like himself, they were outlanders in Zul-Bha-Sair. They came of the swart and narrow-eyed people of Naat, an isle that was little less infamous than Sotar.\n\n\"It is well,\" said the necromancer, as they stood before him with lowered eyes, after making their announcement. \"We have only to await the favorable hour. Midway between sunset and moonrise, when the priests are at their supper in the nether adytum, we will enter the temple and perform that which must be done for the rising of Arctela. They feed well tonight, for I know that many of the dead grow ripe on the great table in the upper sanctuary; and it may be that Mordiggian feeds also. None will come to watch us at our doings.\"\n\n\"But, master,\" said Narghai, shivering a little beneath his robe of nacarat red, \"is it wise, after all, to do this thing? Must you take the girl from the temple? Always, ere this, you have contented yourself with the brief loan that the priests allow, and have rendered back the dead in the required state of exanimation. Truly, is it well to violate the law of the god? Men say that the wrath of Mordiggian, though seldom loosed, is more dreadful than the wrath of all other deities. For this reason, none has dared to defraud him in latter years, or attempt the removal of any of the corpses from his fane. Long ago, it is told, a high noble of the city bore hence the cadaver of a woman he had loved, and fled with it into the desert; but the priests pursued him, running more swiftly than jackals ...and the fate that overtook him is a thing whereof the legends whisper but dimly.\"\n\n\"I fear neither Mordiggian nor his creatures,\" said Abnon-Tha, with a solemn vainglory in his voice. \"My dromedaries can outrun the priests — even granting that the priests are not men at all, but ghouls, as some say. And there is small likelihood that they will follow us: after their feasting tonight, they will sleep like gorged vultures The morrow will find us far on the road to Tasuun, ere they awake.\"\n\n\"The master is right,\" interpolated Vemba-Tsith, \"We have nothing to fear.\"\n\n\"But they say that Mordiggian does not sleep,\" insisted Narghai, \"and that he watches all things eternally from his black vault beneath the temple.\"\n\n\"So I have heard,\" said Abnon-Tha, with a dry and learned air. \"But I consider that such beliefs are mere superstition. There is nothing to confirm them in the real nature of corpse-eating entities. So far, I have never beheld Mordiggian, either sleeping or awake; but in all likelihood he is merely a common ghoul. I know these demons and their habits. They differ from hyenas only through their monstrous shape and size, and their immortality.\"\n\n\"Still, I must deem it an ill thing to cheat Mordiggian,\" muttered Narghai beneath his breath.\n\nThe words were caught by the quick ears of AbnonTha. \"Nay, there is no question of cheating. Well have I served Mordiggian and his priesthood, and amply have I larded their black table. Also, I shall keep, in a sense, the bargain I have made concerning Arctela: the providing of a new cadaver in return for my necromantic privilege. Tomorrow, the youth Alos, the betrothed of Arctela, will lie in her place among the dead. Go now, and leave me, for I must devise the inward invultuation that will rot the heart of Alos, like a worm that awakens at the core of fruit.\"\n\nTo Phariom, fevered and distraught, it seemed that the cloudless day went by with the sluggishness of a corpse-clogged river. Unable to calm his agitation, he wandered aimlessly through the thronged bazaars, till the western towers grew dark on a heaven of saffron flame, and the twilight rose like a gray and curdling sea among the houses. Then he returned to the inn where Elaith had been stricken, and claimed the dromedary which he had left in the tavern stables. Riding the animal through dim thoroughfares, lit only by the covert gleam of lamps or tapers from half-closed windows, he found his way once more to the city's center.\n\nThe dusk had thickened into darkness when he came to the open area surrounding Mordiggian's temple. The windows of mansions fronting the area were shut and lightless as dead eyes, and the fane itself, a colossal bulk of gloom, was rayless as any mausoleum beneath the gathering stars. No one, it seemed, was abroad, and though the quietude was favorable to his project, Phariom shivered with a chill of deathly menace and desolation. The hoofs of his camel rang on the pavement with a startling and preternatural clangor, and he thought that the ears of hidden ghouls, listening alertly behind the silence, must surely hear them.\n\nHowever, there was no stirring of life in that sepulchral gloom. Reaching the shelter of one of the thick groups of ancient cedars, he dismounted and tied the dromedary to a low-growing branch. Keeping among the trees, like a shadow among shadows, he approached the temple with infinite wariness, and circled it slowly, finding that its four doorways, which corresponded to the four quarters of the Earth, were all wide open, deserted, and equally dark. Returning at length to the eastern side, on which he had tethered his camel, he emboldened himself to enter the blackly gaping portal.\n\nCrossing the threshold, he was engulfed instantly by a dead and clammy darkness, touched with the faint fetor of corruption, and a smell as of charred bone and flesh. He thought that he was in a huge corridor, and feeling his way forward along the right-hand wall, he soon came to a sudden turn, and saw a bluish glimmering far ahead, as if in some central adytum where the hall ended. Massy columns were silhouetted against the glimmering; and across it, as he drew nearer, several dark and muffled figures passed, presenting the profiles of enormous skulls. Two of them were sharing the burden of a human body which they carried in their arms. To Phariom, pausing in the shadowy hall, it appeared that the vague taint of putrescence upon the air grew stronger for a few instants after the figure had come and gone.\n\nThey were not succeeded by any others, and the fane resumed its mausolean stillness. But the youth waited for many minutes, doubtful and trepidant, before venturing to go on. An oppression of mortuary mystery thickened the air, and stifled him like the noisome effluvia of catacombs. His ears became intolerably acute, and he heard a dim humming, a sound of deep and viscid voices indistinguishably bent, that appeared to issue from crypts beneath the temple.\n\nStealing at length to the hall's end, he peered beyond into what was obviously the main sanctuary: a low and many-pillared room, whose vastness was but half-revealed by the bluish fires that glowed and flickered in numerous urnlike vessels borne aloft on slender stelae.\n\nPhariom hesitated upon that awful threshold, for the mingled odors of burnt and decaying flesh were heavier on the air, as if he had drawn nearer to their sources; and the thick humming seemed to ascend from a dark stairway in the floor, beside the left-hand wall. But the room, to all appearance, was empty of life, and nothing stirred except the wavering lights and shadows. The watcher discerned the outlines of a vast table in the center, carved from the same black stone as the building itself. Upon the table, half lit by the flaming urns, or shrouded by the umbrage of the heavy columns, a number of people lay side by side; and Phariom knew that he had found the black altar of Mordiggian, whereon were disposed the bodies claimed by the god.\n\nA wild and stifling fear contended with a wilder hope in his bosom. Trembling, he went toward the table; and a cold clamminess, wrought by the presence of the dead, assailed him. The table was nearly thirty feet in length, and it rose waist-high on a dozen mighty legs. Beginning at the nearer end, he passed along the row of corpses, peering fearfully into each upturned face. Both sexes, and many ages and differing ranks were represented. Nobles and rich merchants were crowded by beggars in filthy rags. Some were newly dead, and others, it seemed, had lain there for days, and were beginning to show the marks of corruption. There were many gaps in the ordered row, suggesting that certain of the corpses had been removed. Phariom went on in the dim light, searching for the loved features of Elaith. At last, when he was nearing the further end, and had begun to fear that she was not among them, he found her.\n\nWith the cryptic pallor and stillness of her strange malady upon her, she lay unchanged on the chill stone. A great thankfulness was born in the heart of Phariom, for he felt sure that she was not dead — and that she had not awakened at any time to the horrors of the temple. If he could bear her away from the hateful purlieus of Zul-Bha-Sair without detection, she would recover from her death-simulating sickness.\n\nCursorily, he noted that another woman was lying beside Elaith, and recognized her as the beautiful Arctela, whose bearers he had followed almost to the portals of the fane. He gave her no second glance, but stooped to lift Elaith in his arms.\n\nAt that moment, he heard a murmur of low voices in the direction of the door by which he had entered the sanctuary. Thinking that some of the priests had returned, he dropped swiftly on hands and knees and crawled beneath the ponderous table, which afforded the only accessible hiding-place. Retreating into shadow beyond the glimmering shed from the lofty urns, he waited and looked out between the pillar-thick legs.\n\nThe voices grew louder, and he saw the curiously sandaled feet and shortish robes of three persons who approached the table of the dead and paused in the very spot where he himself had stood a few instants before. Who they were, he could not surmise; but their garments of light and swarthy red were not the shroudings of Mordiggian's priests. He was uncertain whether or not they had seen him; and crouching in the low space beneath the table, he plucked his dagger from its sheath.\n\nNow, he was able to distinguish three voices, one solemn and unctuously imperative, one somewhat guttural and growling, and the other shrill and nasal. The accents were alien, differing from those of the men of Zul-Bha-Sair, and the words were often strange to Phariom. Also, much of the converse was inaudible.\n\n\"... here... at the end,\" said the solemn voice. \"Be swift... We have no time to loiter.\"\n\n\"Yes, Master,\" came the growling voice. \"But who is this other?... Truly, she is very fair.\"\n\nA discussion seemed to take place, in discreetly lowered tones. Apparently the owner of the guttural voice was urging something that the other two opposed. The listener could distinguish only a word or two here and there; but he gathered that the name of the first person was Vembi-Tsith, and that the one who spoke in a nasal shrilling was called Narghai. At last, above the others, the grave accents of the man addressed only as the Master were clearly audible:\n\n\"I do not altogether approve... It will delay our departure... and the two must ride on one dromedary. But take her, Vemba-Tsith, if you can perform the necessary spells unaided. I have no time for a double incantation... It will be a good test of your proficiency.\"\n\nThere was a mumbling as of thanks or acknowledgment from Vemba-Tsith. Then the voice of the Master: \"Be quiet now and make haste.\" To Phariom, wondering vaguely and uneasily as to the import of this colloquy, it seemed that two of the three men pressed closer to the table, as if stooping above the dead. He heard a rustling of cloth upon stone, and an instant later, he saw that all three were departing among the columns and stelae, in a direction opposite to that from which they had entered the sanctuary. Two of them carried burdens that glimmered palely and indistinctly in the shadows.\n\nA black horror clutched at the heart of Phariom, for all too clearly he surmised the nature of those burdens and the possible identity of one of them. Quickly he crawled forth from his hiding-place and saw that Elaith was gone from the black table, together with the girl Arctela. He saw the vanishing of shadowy figures in the gloom that zoned the chamber's western wall. Whether the abductors were ghouls, or worse than ghouls, he could not know, but he followed swiftly, forgetful of all caution in his concern for Elaith.\n\nReaching the wall, he found the mouth of a corridor, and plunged into it headlong. Somewhere in the gloom ahead, he saw a ruddy glimmering of light. Then he heard a sullen, metallic grating; and the glimmer narrowed to a slit-like gleam, as if the door of the chamber from which it issued were being closed.\n\nFollowing the blind wall, he came to that slit of crimson light. A door of darkly tarnished bronze had been left ajar, and Phariom peered in on a weird, unholy scene, illumined by the blood-like flames that flared and soared unsteadily from high urns upborne on sable pedestals.\n\nThe room was full of a sensuous luxury that accorded strangely with the dull, funereal stone of that temple of death. There were couches and carpets of superbly figured stuffs, vermilion, gold, azure, silver; and jeweled censers of unknown metals stood in the corners. A low table at one side was littered with curious bottles, and occult appliances such as might be used in medicine or sorcery.\n\nElaith was lying on one of the couches, and near her, on a second couch, the body of the girl Arctela had been disposed. The abductors, whose faces Phariom now beheld for the first time, were busying themselves with singular preparations that mystified him prodigiously. His impulse to invade the room was repressed by a sort of wonder that held him enthralled and motionless.\n\nOne of the three, a tall, middle-aged man whom he identified as the Master, had assembled certain peculiar vessels, including a small brazier and a censer, and had set them on the floor beside Arctela. The second, a younger man with lecherously slitted eyes, had placed similar impedimenta before Elaith. The third, who was also young and evil of aspect, merely stood and looked on with an apprehensive, uneasy air.\n\nPhariom divined that the men were sorcerers when, with a deftness born of long practice, they lit the censers and braziers, and began simultaneously the intonation of rhythmically measured words in a strange tongue accompanied by the sprinkling, at regular intervals, of black oils that fell with a great hissing on the coals in the braziers and sent up enormous clouds of pearly smoke. Dark threads of vapor serpentined from the censers, interweaving themselves like veins through the dim, misshapen figures as of ghostly giants that were formed by the lighter fumes. A reek of intolerably acrid balsams filled the chamber, assailing and troubling the senses of Phariom, till the scene wavered before him and took on a dreamlike vastness, a narcotic distortion.\n\nThe voices of the necromancers mounted and fell as if in some unholy paean. Imperious, exigent, they seemed to implore the consummation of forbidden blasphemy. Like thronging phantoms, writhing and swirling with malignant life, the vapors rose about the couches on which lay the dead girl and the girl who bore the outward likeness of death.\n\nThen, as the fumes were riven apart in their baleful seething, Phariom saw that the pale figure of Elaith had stirred like a sleeper who awakens, that she had opened her eyes and was lifting a feeble hand from the gorgeous couch. The younger necromancer ceased his chanting on a sharply broken cadence; but the solemn tones of the other still went on, and still there was a spell on the limbs and senses of Phariom, making it impossible for him to stir.\n\nSlowly the vapors thinned like a rout of dissolving phantoms. The watcher saw that the dead girl, Arctela, was rising to her feet like a somnambulist. The chanting of Abnon-Tha, standing before her, came sonorously to an end. In the awful silence that followed, Phariom heard a weak cry from Elaith, and then the jubilant, growling voice of Vemba-Tsith, who was stooping above her:\n\n\"Behold, O Abnon-Tha! My spells are swifter than yours, for she that I have chosen awakened before Arctela!\"\n\nPhariom was released from his thralldom, as if through the lifting of an evil enchantment. He flung back the ponderous door of darkened bronze, that ground with protesting clangors on its hinges. His dagger drawn, he rushed into the room.\n\nElaith, her eyes wide with piteous bewilderment, turned toward him and made an ineffectual effort to arise from the couch. Arctela, mute and submissive before Abnon-Tha, appeared to heed nothing but the will of the necromancer. She was like a fair and soulless automaton. The sorcerers, turning as Phariom entered, sprang back with instant agility before his onset, and drew the short, cruelly crooked swords which they all carried. Narghai struck the knife from Phariom's fingers with a darting blow that shattered its thin blade at the hilt, and VembaTsith, his weapon swinging back in a vicious arc, would have killed the youth promptly if Abnon-Tha had not intervened and bade him stay.\n\nPhariom, standing furious but irresolute before the lifted swords, was aware of the darkly searching eyes of Abnon-Tha, like those of some nyctalopic bird of prey.\n\n\"I would know the meaning of this intrusion,\" said the necromancer. \"Truly, you are bold to enter the temple of Mordiggian.\"\n\n\"I came to find the girl who lies yonder,\" declared Phariom. \"She is Elaith, my wife, who was claimed unjustly by the god. But tell me, why have you brought her to this room, from the table of Mordiggian, and what manner of men are you, that raise up the dead as you have raised this other woman?\"\n\n\"I am Abnon-Tha, the necromancer, and these others are my pupils, Narghai and Vemba-Tsith. Give thanks to Vemba-Tsith, for verily he has brought back your wife from the purlieus of the dead with a skill excelling that of his master. She awoke ere the incantation was finished!\"\n\nPhariom glared with implacable suspicion at Abnon-Tha. \"Elaith was not dead, but only as one in a trance,\" he averred. \"It was not your pupil's sorcery that awakened her. And verily whether Elaith be dead or living is not a matter that should concern any but myself. Permit us to depart, for I wish to remove with her from Zul-Bha-Sair, in which we are only passing travelers.\"\n\nSo speaking, he turned his back on the necromancers, and went over to Elaith, who regarded him with dazed eyes but uttered his name feebly as he clasped her in his arms.\n\n\"Now, this is a remarkable coincidence,\" purred Abnon-Tha. \"I and my pupils are also planning to depart from Zul-Bha-Sair, and we start this very night. Perhaps you will honor us with your company.\"\n\n\"I thank you,\" said Phariom, curtly. \"But I am not sure that our roads lie together. Elaith and I would go toward Tasuun.\"\n\n\"Now, by the black altar of Mordiggian, that is still stranger coincidence, for Tasuun is also our destination We take with us the resurrected girl Arctela, whom I have deemed too fair for the charnel god and his ghouls.\"\n\nPhariom divined the dark evil that lay behind the oily, mocking speeches of the necromancer. Also, he saw the furtive and sinister sign that Abnon-Tha had made to his assistants. Weaponless, he could only give a formal assent to the sardonic proposal. He knew well that he would not be permitted to leave the temple alive, for the narrow eyes of Narghai and Vemba-Tsith, regarding him closely, were alight with the red lust of murder.\n\n\"Come,\" said Abnon-Tha, in a voice of imperious command. \"It is time to go.\" He turned to the still figure of Arctela and spoke an unknown word. With vacant eyes and noctambulistic paces, she followed at his heels as he stepped toward the open door. Phariom had helped Elaith to her feet, and was whispering words of reassurance in an effort to lull the growing horror and confused alarm that he saw in her eyes. She was able to walk, albeit slowly and uncertainly. Vemba-Tsith and Narghai drew back, motioning that she and Phariom should precede them; but Phariom, sensing their intent to slay him as soon as his back was turned, obeyed unwillingly and looked desperately about for something that he could seize as a weapon.\n\nOne of the metal braziers, full of smoldering coals, was at his very feet. He stooped quickly, lifted it in his hands, and turned upon the necromancers. Vemba-Tsith, as he had suspected, was prowling toward him with upraised, sword, and was making ready to strike. Phariom hurled the brazier and its glowing contents full in the necromancer's face, and Vemba-Tsith went down with a terrible, smothered cry. Narghai, snarling ferociously, leapt foreward to assail the defenseless youth. His scimitar gleamed with a wicked luster in the lurid glare of the urns as he swung it back for the blow. But the weapon did not fall; and Phariom, steeling himself against the impending death, became aware that Narghai was staring beyond him as if petrified by the vision of some Gorgonian specter.\n\nAs if compelled by another will than his own, the youth turned and saw the thing that had halted Narghai's blow. Arctela and Abnon-Tha, pausing before the open door, were outlined against a colossal shadow that was not wrought by anything in the room. It filled the portals from side to side, it towered above the lintel — and then, swiftly, it became more than a shadow: it was a bulk of darkness, black and opaque, that somehow blinded the eyes with a strange dazzlement. It seemed to suck the flame from the red urns and fill the chamber with a chill of utter death and voidness. Its form was that of a worm-shapen column, huge as a dragon, its further coils still issuing from the gloom of the corridor; but it changed from moment to moment, swirling and spinning as if alive with the vortical energies of dark eons. Briefly it took the semblance of some demoniac giant with eyeless head and limbless body; and then, leaping and spreading like smoky fire, it swept forward into the chamber.\n\nAbnon-Tha fell back before it, with frantic mumblings of malediction or exorcism; but Arctela, pale and slight and motionless, remained full in its path, while the thing enfolded her and enveloped her with a hungry flaring until she was hidden wholly from view.\n\nPhariom, supporting Elaith, who leaned weakly on his shoulder as if about to swoon, was powerless to move. He forgot the murderous Narghai, and it seemed that he and Elaith were but faint shadows in the presence of embodied death and dissolution. He saw the blackness grow and wax with the towering of fed flame as it closed about Arctela; and he saw it gleam with eddying hues of somber iris, like the spectrum of a sable sun. For an instant, he heard a soft and flame-like murmuring. Then, quickly and terribly, the thing ebbed from the room. Arctela was gone, as if she had dissolved like a phantom on the air. Borne on a sudden gust of strangely mingled heat and cold, there came an acrid odor, such as would rise from a burnt-out funeral pyre.\n\n\"Mordiggian!\" shrilled Narghai, in hysteric terror. \"It was the god Mordiggian! He has taken Arctela!\"\n\nIt seemed that his cry was answered by a score of sardonic echoes, unhuman as the howling of hyenas, and yet articulate, that repeated the name Mordiggian. Into the room, from the dark hall, there poured a horde of creatures whose violet robes alone identified them in Phariom's eyes as the priests of the ghoul-god. They had removed the skull-like masks, revealing heads and faces that were half anthropomorphic, half canine, and wholly diabolic. Also, they had taken off the fingerless gloves... There were at least a dozen of them. Their curving talons gleamed in the bloody light like the hooks of darkly tarnished metal; their spiky teeth, longer than coffin nails, protruded from snarling lips. They closed like a ring of jackals on Abnon-Tha and Narghai, driving them back into the farthest corner. Several others, entering tardily, fell with a bestial ferocity on Vemba-Tsith, who had begun to revive, and was moaning and writhing on the floor amid the scattered coals of the brazier.\n\nThey seemed to ignore Phariom and Elaith, who stood looking on as if in some baleful trance. But the hindmost, ere he joined the assailants of Vemba-Tsith, turned to the youthful pair and addressed them in a hoarse, hollow voice, like a tomb-reverberate barking:\n\n\"Go, for Mordiggian is a just god, who claims only the dead, and has no concern with the living. And we, the priests of Mordiggian, deal in our own fashion with those who would violate his law by removing the dead from the temple.\"\n\nPhariom, with Elaith still leaning on his shoulder, went out into the dark hall, hearing a hideous clamor in which the screams of men were mingled with a growling as of jackals, a laughter as of hyenas. The clamor ceased as, they entered the blue-lit sanctuary and passed toward the outer corridor, and the silence that filled Mordiggian's fane behind them was deep as the silence of the dead on the black altar-table.",

"\"莫迪吉安是祖尔-巴-赛尔的神祇，\"客栈老板用油滑而庄重的语气说道，\"自人类记忆无法追溯的幽邃年代起，祂就是这座城的主宰，其历史比祂那黑色神庙的地下墓穴更为深不可测。在祖尔-巴-赛尔没有其他神明。所有死在城墙之内的生灵都归莫迪吉安所有。即便是国王与权贵，死后也要被交到那些裹着尸布的祭司手中。这是律法，也是习俗。过不了多久，祭司们就会来带走你的新娘。\"\n\n\"可伊莱丝明明没死！\"青年法里昂已是第三次还是第四次发出这般凄厉的抗议，声音里浸透绝望，\"她患的病症会伪装成死亡的假象。先前已有两次，她像这样苍白冰冷地躺着，连血液都凝滞不动，与死人无异；可过了几日又苏醒过来。\"\n\n客栈老板带着沉重的不信任感，打量着那个躺在简陋阁楼床榻上的姑娘——她苍白如被刈割的百合，纹丝不动。\n\n\"既是如此，你本不该带她来祖尔-巴-赛尔，\"他猫头鹰般阴鸷地讥讽道，\"医师已宣布她的死讯，祭司们也都知晓了。她必须前往莫迪吉安的神庙。\"\n\n\"可我们是异乡人，只借宿一晚。我们从北方遥远的希拉克之地而来，今日本该取道塔苏恩，前往南方海滨的约罗斯都城法拉德。即便她真死了，你们的神明也无权索要伊莱丝！\"\n\n\"凡死于祖尔-巴-赛尔者，皆为莫迪吉安之财产，\"客栈老板不容置疑地宣判，\"异乡人亦不例外。祂那幽暗神庙的血盆大口永远饥渴，千百年来无人能逃脱——无论男女老幼。凡人的血肉终将成为神明的飨宴。\"\n\n这番油腻而阴森的宣告令法里昂浑身战栗。\n\n\"我在希拉克听旅人提起过莫迪吉安的传说，\"他艰涩地承认，\"但我忘了这座城的名字...纵使记得，我也不会相信竟有如此骇人的习俗...这模仿鬣狗与秃鹫行径的，算什么神明？分明是食尸鬼！\"\n\n\"当心你的亵渎之语，\"客栈老板警告道，\"莫迪吉安如死亡般古老而全能。在佐西克大陆自海底升起前，远古大陆便已供奉祂。正因祂的存在，我们才免于腐朽与蛆虫。就像别处用火焰净化尸体，我们祖尔-巴-赛尔人将死者献给神明。那座可怖的神庙终年不见阳光，尸体被祭司们抬进去，摆放在巨石祭台上，等待祂从地底居所降临。除祭司外，无人见过祂的真容——那些祭司戴着银质面具，连双手都裹着尸布，凡人不得窥见直面过神明的面孔。\"\n\n\"可祖尔-巴-赛尔总有国王吧？我要向他控诉这暴行！\"\n\n\"芬阔尔虽是国王，却也爱莫能助。莫迪吉安凌驾于诸王之上，祂的律法神圣不可违抗。听！祭司们来了。\"\n\n法里昂听见通往阁楼的楼梯传来邪恶的吱呀声，顿时心如刀绞。那声响以非人的速度逼近，四个裹着丧葬紫袍、戴着骷髅银面具的身影闯入房间。正如店主所言，他们连手指都藏在无指手套中，宽松的紫袍如裹尸布般拖曳过地板。他们抬着由黑色皮条与兽骨编织的尸架，皮革上浸透经年累月的尸油。\n\n法里昂抽出腰间短刀冲向祭司，却被其中两人以毒蛇般的速度击倒。他撞上墙角昏厥过去，醒来时发现阁楼已空无一人，只听见店主瓮声瓮气地说：\"莫迪吉安的祭司怜悯生者的癫狂，你该庆幸他们的仁慈。\"\n\n青年抓起短刀冲下腐朽的楼梯，闯入祖尔-巴-赛尔蜿蜒的街巷。这座城比其他都市更古老阴暗，此刻在他眼中却像通往巨型墓穴的地下甬道。朝阳照在突出的屋檐上，他却觉得那光芒如同渗入墓室的惨淡微光。往来行人此刻在他眼里都像在坟茔间游荡的食尸鬼。\n\n他痛苦地回想起昨日黄昏与伊莱丝进城的情形。夕阳为穹顶镀上紫红，窗扉透出温暖灯火，这座城本如梦境般美好。他们因政治迫害逃离希拉克，原计划在此休憩两日再前往约罗斯投奔亲族。商队遭遇沙匪后，他们误打误撞来到这座不在行程中的边城。\n\n为节省开支，他们投宿在平民区的旅店。夜间伊莱丝第三次癫痫发作——这种假死症状曾在她婚前出现过，希拉克的医师本已控制住病情。祖尔-巴-赛尔的庸医却草率宣布死讯，唤来了那些裹尸布的祭司。此刻法里昂狂奔在迷宫般的街道上，迟来的记忆不断浮现：祖尔-巴-赛尔的恶名远播，商旅皆不愿久留。传说尸体要在黑暗神庙里腐烂多日才被分食，更有甚者，人们窃语着比食尸更亵渎的仪式，说死者在献给莫迪吉安前会遭遇不可名状的亵渎。对外乡人而言，死在祖尔-巴-赛尔是最恶毒的诅咒；可当地居民却将这视为理所当然的殡葬方式——多亏这位\"实用主义\"的神明，他们省却了坟墓、火葬等诸多麻烦。\n\n法里昂惊愕地发现城中居民仍如常生活。搬运工扛着家用货物穿行，商贩如常蹲坐在店铺里，集市里买卖双方高声议价，女人们在门廊间谈笑风生。唯有那些红黑紫三色宽袍与怪异口音，才能让他将祖尔-巴-赛尔居民与自己这样的外乡人区分开来。噩梦的阴霾开始从他意识中消散；周遭平凡的人间景象逐渐平息了他狂乱的绝望。爱莱丝遭遇的可怖命运仍如附骨之疽，但此刻，残酷现实催生的冰冷理智让他开始思考如何从那食尸鬼之神的庙宇中救出她——这个看似无望的难题。\n\n他收敛神情，将焦躁步伐伪装成闲散漫步，以免被人看破内心的煎熬。假装对服装商贩的货物产生兴趣，他顺势打探起祖尔-巴-赛尔的习俗。商贩健谈，法里昂很快得知莫迪吉安神庙位于城市中心，且日夜开放任人进出。但除祭司主持的隐秘仪式外，庙内并无常规祭祀活动。因着某种迷信——任何擅闯幽暗圣殿的活人不久便会成为神明的祭品——鲜少有人愿踏入神庙。\n\n在祖尔-巴-赛尔居民眼中，莫迪吉安竟是位仁慈神祇。古怪的是，无人能描述其具体形貌。他更像是元素般的非人格力量——如火焰般吞噬与净化的存在。他的祭司同样神秘：常住庙中，仅执行殡葬职责时才会现身。无人知晓他们如何补充新成员，有传言说这些祭司男女皆有，世代延续却不见婚配；更有人说他们根本非人，而是与神明同样以尸体为食的地下生物。近年由此衍生出异端学说，认为莫迪吉安不过是祭司集团虚构的存在。商贩提及此说时，忙不迭以虔诚谴责与之划清界限。\n\n法里昂又闲谈片刻，便继续穿行于曲折街巷，尽可能径直朝神庙方向前进。虽无明确计划，他决意先侦察周边。服装商贩所言唯一令他宽慰的，是圣殿对外开放且来者不拒。但访客稀少反而会让他引人注目——这恰是他最需避免的。另一方面，从神庙盗尸之举在此地人听来简直胆大包天。或许正因计划足够疯狂，他才可能避开怀疑成功救出爱莱丝。\n\n所经街道开始下倾，愈发狭窄昏暗曲折。正疑心迷路时，四名莫迪吉安祭司抬着骨革制成的奇异尸架，从前方古巷突然现身。尸架上的少女让法里昂浑身震颤——刹那他以为那是爱莱丝。细看才知误认：这女子虽苍白如爱莱丝，却生着黑罂粟花瓣般的卷发，死亡亦难掩其冶艳风情，与爱莱丝金发白肤的纯净美恰如热带百合与水仙之别。\n\n法里昂保持距离尾随这群阴郁抬尸者。路人敬畏地为尸架让道，商贩们见祭司经过也噤若寒蝉。从市民窃语中他得知死者是贵族法官夸奥斯之女阿珂特拉，死因蹊跷离奇，医师束手无策，却未损其美貌分毫。有人疑为无色无味之毒，更有人断言是邪术所害。\n\n随着地势陡降，房屋如临崖退缩般愈发拥挤。最终他跟随抬尸队抵达城市心脏的圆形洼地。莫迪吉安神庙如庞然墓冢矗立在乌黑雪松环绕的缟玛瑙广场上。这座泛着尸腐紫黑的奇异建筑拒绝一切天光，无窗的构造活像巨型陵寝，门洞在树影中如墓穴般森然张开。\n\n法里昂目送祭司们如幽灵抬着幽灵般消失在门内。广场空无一人，他不敢在白昼暴露行迹。绕行探查发现神庙四面入口皆洞开无守。整座建筑死寂如墓，但想到墙内可能隐藏的可怖景象——正如大理石棺内蠕虫的盛宴——他不禁战栗。传闻中那些亵渎场景在阳光下浮现脑海，几欲将他逼疯。想到爱莱丝正躺在尸堆中，而自己必须在夜幕掩护下才能实施那渺茫的救援计划，其间她若苏醒面对周遭恐怖很可能会惊惧致死……若那些窃语传言属实，更可怕的事或许正在发生……\n\n巫师兼死灵法师阿布农-萨正为自己与莫迪吉安祭司达成的交易沾沾自喜。他确有理由自负：若非他这般机巧，怎能设计让高傲夸奥斯之女阿珂特拉成为绝对服从的奴隶？这位已与贵族青年阿洛斯订婚的少女，本非寻常术士可觊觎。但阿布农-萨岂是等闲之辈？这位来自索塔尔恶岛的法师精通最深邃黑暗的秘术，能隔空施咒杀人于无形，亦能令腐朽多年的尸体复生。他以不留痕迹的稀有咒术杀害阿珂特拉，其尸体现正躺在莫迪吉安神庙。今夜，在那些可怖裹尸布祭司的默许下，他将使她重生。\n\n阿布农-萨并非本地人，多年前从佐西克大陆以东臭名昭著的索塔尔岛来此，如秃鹫般盘踞在停尸庙阴影中，广收门徒。他与祭司们的肮脏交易由来已久。作为不将实验尸体移出神庙的交换，他常贿赂祭司——非以金银，而是承诺供给比金银更腐坏之物。这安排令各方满意：自他来后，庙中尸体较往常更丰足；神明不缺祭品；而他总有素材施展那些恶毒咒法。\n\n此刻阿布农-萨对自己颇为满意。除却魔法造诣与狡诈机谋，他即将展现近乎无先例的勇气——计划盗走复活的阿珂特拉。此类盗尸行为及其惩罚仅存于传说，近世未闻。民间信仰中，失败者将遭三重厄运。死灵法师清楚风险，却未被吓阻。\n\n两名助手纳尔盖与文巴-锡斯已知晓计划，正秘密准备逃离祖尔-巴-赛尔。对阿珂特拉的狂热并非法师离开的唯一动机。此地虽便利，某些古怪律法实则限制其死灵术实践。他计划南行至以古老木乃伊闻名的塔苏恩帝国某城定居。\n\n日落时分，五匹赛驼在法师宅邸内院待命。这座霉迹斑斑的高耸建筑仿佛倾压在神庙所属的圆形空场上。一匹骆驼将驮载法师最珍贵的魔法书稿，余下承载三人及阿珂特拉。\n\n助手们禀告万事俱备。他们比主人年轻，同样来自声名狼藉的纳特岛。\"很好，\"法师道，\"只待吉时。日落月升之交，祭司们在底层圣所用膳时，我们便入庙行复生之术。他们今夜盛宴丰盛——我知上层圣殿大祭台上陈着许多成熟尸体，或许莫迪吉安也正进餐。无人会来打扰。\"\n\n\"但主人，\"纳尔盖在猩红袍下颤抖，\"盗走少女当真明智？从前您满足于祭司许可的短暂借用，最终归还尸体。触怒神明恐非善举。人说莫迪吉安之怒虽罕见，却比诸神更可怕。因此近年无人敢欺诈他或盗尸。古时有贵族盗走爱人尸体逃入沙漠，祭司们竟比豺狼更快追上……其下场传说都讳莫如深。\"\n\n\"我既不惧莫迪吉安，也不怕其爪牙。\"阿布农-萨倨傲道，\"我的赛驼快过祭司——即便他们真如传言是食尸鬼。他们饱食后必如饕餮秃鹫酣睡，待其醒来，我们早抵塔苏恩途中。\"\n\n\"主人英明，\"文巴-锡斯插口，\"我们无所畏惧。\"\n\n\"但传说莫迪吉安永不入眠，\"纳尔盖坚持，\"他在庙底黑窟中永恒监视万物。\"\n\n\"此乃迷信。\"法师干涩而学究气地断言，\"食尸鬼本质不过如此。我从未见过莫迪吉安醒睡，他多半只是普通食尸鬼。我深知此类恶魔习性——除去形貌巨硕与永生，与鬣狗无异。\"\n\n纳尔盖仍嘀咕：\"欺骗神明终非善举。\"\n\n阿布农-萨尖耳捕捉到此言：\"非也，何谈欺骗？我侍奉莫迪吉安与其祭司已久，黑祭台供奉丰足。至于阿珂特拉，某种意义上我仍守约——以新尸换死灵术特权。明日其未婚夫阿洛斯将代她陈尸庙中。退下吧，我需构思让那青年心脏如果实生虫般腐烂的内蚀咒。\"\n\n对焦灼的法里昂而言，无云的白天缓慢如塞满尸体的河流。他漫无目的徘徊在喧嚣集市，直至西塔楼剪影映上橘红天幕，暮色如凝浊海水漫过屋舍。他回到爱莱丝倒下的旅店，牵出寄存的骆驼。借半掩窗扉透出的微光穿过幽暗街道，再次来到城心。\n\n当法里昂抵达神庙周围的空场时，暮色已浓。环立宅邸的窗户如死目般紧闭无光，神庙本身在聚拢的星光下如巨墓般漆黑。万籁俱寂本利于行动，他却因死亡威胁的寒意颤抖。驼蹄叩击路面的声响异常清脆，他疑心寂静中潜伏的食尸鬼必已听见。\n\n然而坟茔般的黑暗里毫无生机。他在古雪松丛中拴好骆驼，如影穿梭树间，谨慎绕行神庙一周，发现对应四方位的四道门皆洞开无人。最终他回到东侧入口，鼓起勇气踏入那张开的黑色巨口。\n\n跨过门槛的刹那，腐朽与焦骨血肉的气息裹着死寂的阴冷将他吞没。他摸索右侧墙壁前行，拐过突折处，望见走廊尽头中央圣所泛着幽蓝微光。粗柱轮廓映在光中，几个裹着尸布、头颅硕大的黑影横穿光芒，其中两人共抬一具人体。当黑影消失后，空气中若有若无的腐味似乎骤然浓烈起来。\n\n## II\n\n再无人迹接踵而至，这座神殿重归墓穴般的死寂。但青年仍迟疑颤抖地等待了许久，才敢继续前行。停尸间特有的诡谲压迫感在空气中凝结，如同地下墓穴散发的腐臭气息般令他窒息。他的听觉变得异常敏锐，捕捉到一阵模糊的嗡鸣——那是从神庙地窖深处传来的、黏稠而难以辨别的低沉絮语。\n\n当他终于潜行至大厅尽头，窥见主圣所的真容：低矮的厅堂里林立着无数石柱，幽蓝火焰在细长石碑顶端的瓮形容器中明灭不定，仅能照亮这广袤空间的一半。\n\n法里奥姆在那可怖的门槛前踌躇不前，因为焚烧与腐烂血肉的混合气息愈发浓重，仿佛他正接近气味的源头；而那厚重的嗡鸣似乎源自左侧墙边、地板上某道黑暗阶梯。但整个厅堂看似毫无生机，唯有摇曳的光影在流动。守望者辨认出中央巨大的黑石祭台——与整座建筑材质相同。祭台上并列躺着许多人，有的被火瓮照亮，有的则隐没在巨柱投下的阴影中。法里奥姆知道，这就是莫尔迪基安的黑色祭坛，陈列着被神祇索取的尸体。\n\n狂乱的窒息恐惧与更疯狂的希望在他胸中交战。他颤抖着走向祭台，亡者带来的阴冷黏腻感侵袭全身。这方近三十英尺长的黑石台由十二根粗壮支柱支撑，高度及腰。他从近端开始，战战兢兢地检视每具仰面尸体的面容。男女老幼、贫富贵贱在此齐聚：裹着污秽破布的乞丐与华服贵族比邻而卧。有些新死未久，有些似乎已陈列数日，开始显现腐败痕迹。整齐排列的尸体间有许多空缺，暗示部分已被移走。法里奥姆借着微光继续寻找爱蕾丝熟悉的面容。就在他接近远端，几乎要绝望时，终于发现了她。\n\n她躺在冰冷的石台上，仍保持着那种怪病赋予的诡谲苍白与静止。法里奥姆心中涌起巨大欣慰，因为他确信她并未真正死亡——也从未苏醒面对这座神庙的可怖。只要能将她安然带出祖尔-巴-塞尔这座憎恶之城，她就能从假死状态中康复。\n\n他草草注意到爱蕾丝身旁躺着另一位女子——正是他尾随至神殿门口的美丽阿珂特拉。但他无暇多顾，俯身欲将爱蕾丝抱起。\n\n就在此刻，他听见入口方向传来低语。以为祭司们归来，他迅速匍匐钻入祭台底部——这是唯一的藏身之处。他退到高耸火瓮投下的阴影中，从粗如立柱的台腿间隙窥视。\n\n人声渐近，他看见三双奇特的凉鞋和暗红色短袍下摆停在方才自己站立的位置。从服饰判断，他们绝非莫尔迪基安的祭司。不确定是否被发现的他从鞘中抽出匕首。\n\n此刻他分辨出三个声音：一个庄严而专横，一个喉音浓重如咆哮，另一个尖锐刺耳。口音迥异于祖尔-巴-塞尔居民，许多词汇对法里奥姆而言陌生难解。\n\n\"...就在...尽头，\"庄严声音说道。\"动作快...我们耽搁不起。\"\n\n\"遵命，主人。\"咆哮声回应。\"但旁边这位是谁？...确实美艳绝伦。\"\n\n随后是压低嗓音的争论。法里奥姆只捕捉到零星词汇，得知喉音者名叫维姆巴-锡斯，尖嗓者叫纳尔盖。最终那个被称为\"主人\"的肃穆声音清晰响起：\n\n\"我并非完全赞同...这会延误行程...况且两人得共乘一匹骆驼。但若你能独立完成必要咒术，维姆巴-锡斯，就带上她吧...正好检验你的技艺。\"\n\n维姆巴-锡斯发出感恩的嘟囔。主人又令：\"噤声，速办。\"法里奥姆隐约不安之际，看见其中两人俯身祭台。布料摩擦石面的窸窣声后，三人竟扛着苍白模糊的负担，朝相反方向离去。\n\n法里奥姆心中腾起黑色恐惧——他太清楚那些负担意味着什么。他冲出藏身处，发现爱蕾丝与阿珂特拉均已消失。暗影正在西墙的幽暗中淡去。无论劫掠者是食尸鬼还是更可怖的存在，他都毫不犹豫地追了上去。\n\n循至墙边，他冲进一条走廊。前方黑暗中有红光闪烁，随后传来沉闷的金属摩擦声——光芒缩成细线，似有门扉正在关闭。\n\n他摸到那道猩红光缝。一扇晦暗的青铜门虚掩着，门内景象被黑基座火瓮中血般跃动的火焰照亮：奢华的卧榻与地毯铺陈其间，与死亡神殿的阴郁石壁形成诡异对比。角落摆着镶嵌宝石的异金属香炉，侧旁矮桌散落着药剂瓶与巫术器具。\n\n爱蕾丝躺在其中一张卧榻上，不远处是阿珂特拉的躯体。三名劫持者——法里奥姆此刻才看清他们的面容——正进行着令他困惑的诡异仪式。某种震慑力使他僵立原地。\n\n那位被称为\"主人\"的高瘦中年人在阿珂特拉身旁摆好铜盆与香炉；眼神淫邪的年轻人则在爱蕾丝榻前布置相同器具；第三人不安地旁观。当香炉点燃，他们开始用陌生语言吟诵节奏诡异的咒文，并不时洒下黑色油脂——油脂在炭火上嘶嘶作响，蒸腾起珍珠色的浓烟。\n\n烟雾如幽灵巨人般扭动盘旋，刺鼻的树脂味令法里奥姆感官混乱，眼前景象开始扭曲膨胀。死灵法师们的吟诵忽高忽低，仿佛在祈求某种渎神之事的完成。\n\n当毒雾翻涌散开时，法里奥姆看见爱蕾丝如初醒者般动了动眼皮，正从锦榻上虚弱地抬起手臂。年轻法师的咒语戛然而止，而另一人的吟诵仍在继续。此时阿珂特拉竟如梦游者般直挺挺站了起来。\n\n\"看啊，阿布农-萨！\"维姆巴-锡斯俯身在爱蕾丝上方欢呼：\"我的咒语比您更快！\"\n\n仿佛邪咒解除，法里奥姆猛然推开青铜巨门。他持匕冲入内室，看见爱蕾丝正用迷茫的眼神徒劳挣扎着想坐起；而阿珂特拉如精致的无魂傀儡般呆立。死灵法师们敏捷地拔出了弯刃短剑。纳尔盖一击震碎法里奥姆的匕首，若非阿布农-萨阻止，维姆巴-锡斯回扫的利刃早已取他性命。\n\n\"我倒要听听你擅闯的理由。\"死灵法师夜行动物般的眼睛审视着他：\"敢闯莫尔迪基安神殿，胆子不小。\"\n\n\"我来寻找我的妻子爱蕾丝，\"法里奥姆怒视着悬在头顶的利刃，\"她被神明不公地夺走。但你们为何将她从祭台带至此地？你们究竟是什么人，竟能像复活那个女人一样唤醒死者？\"\n\n\"吾乃死灵法师阿布农-塔，此二者乃吾之徒纳尔盖与文巴-西斯。\"那声音滑腻如蛇，\"汝当感激文巴-西斯，诚然，其以超越师承之技艺，令汝妻自亡者之境归来。咒语未毕，她已然苏醒！\"\n\n法里昂以不可动摇的怀疑怒视阿布农-塔。\"伊莱斯并未死去，仅是陷入昏睡，\"他厉声反驳，\"唤醒她的并非汝徒邪术。况且伊莱斯生死与否，本就不该与旁人相干。容我等离去，吾欲携她离开祖尔-巴-塞尔，我们不过是途经此地的旅人。\"\n\n言毕，他转身背对死灵术士们，走向伊莱斯。女子眼神涣散，却在他拥抱时微弱地唤出他的名字。\n\n\"啊，何等奇妙的巧合，\"阿布农-塔喉间发出餍足的咕哝，\"吾等亦将于今夜启程离开祖尔-巴-塞尔。或许阁下愿赏光同行？\"\n\n\"免了，\"法里昂生硬回绝，\"恐怕道不同不相为谋。吾与伊莱斯欲往塔松。\"\n\n\"莫迪吉安的黑祭坛在上！这巧合愈发离奇了，\"死灵法师的语调渗出毒液般的笑意，\"塔松正是吾等目的地。我们带着复生少女阿珂特拉同行——我认定她太过明艳，不该归于尸骸之神与其食尸鬼。\"\n\n法里昂洞悉死灵法师油滑言辞下蛰伏的恶意。当阿布农-塔向助手打出隐秘手势时，他看得真切。手无寸铁的青年只得僵硬应允这讥讽的邀约。纳尔盖与文巴-西斯狭长的双眼正紧盯着他，其中翻涌着猩红的杀戮欲望——他心知肚明，自己绝无可能活着离开神庙。\n\n\"走吧，\"阿布农-塔发出不容违抗的敕令，\"时辰已到。\"他转向静立的阿珂特拉，吐出一个诡谲音节。少女顿时目光空洞，以梦游者的步伐跟随他走向敞开的门扉。法里昂搀扶起伊莱斯，在她耳畔低语安抚，试图平息她眼中滋长的恐惧与混乱。她虽步履蹒跚，尚能行走。文巴-西斯与纳尔盖退至两侧，示意他们先行——法里昂深知转身瞬间便是命丧之时，勉强挪步时绝望地搜寻着可用武器。\n\n脚边铜火盆里暗红炭火正阴燃。他猛然俯身抄起火盆砸向死灵术士们。果然文巴-西斯已高举利剑潜至身后，灼热的铜器裹挟炭火正中其面门，术士在窒息的惨叫声中倒地。纳尔盖狂哮着扑向手无寸铁的青年，弯刀在瓮中血光里划出凶戾弧线——然而利刃迟迟未落。法里昂绷紧身躯等待致命一击，却发现纳尔盖正凝视他身后，仿佛被蛇发女妖的可怖幻象石化。\n\n青年如受无形之力牵引般转身，终于看见中止杀戮的存在。阿珂特拉与阿布农-塔僵在门前，轮廓被某种绝非室内之物的庞然阴影所吞噬。那阴影塞满整个门框，高过门楣，继而骤然凝实——化作一团能灼伤视线的漆黑实体，宛如吸尽红瓮中的火焰，令石室浸透死寂的严寒。其形似巨蟒盘踞，龙躯般的末端仍从走廊幽暗中不断涌现；形态每瞬都在扭曲，翻涌着太古黑暗的涡流能量。它时而化作无目无肢的恶魔巨人，时而如烟焰爆燃，向室内席卷而来。\n\n阿布农-塔踉跄后退，癫狂念叨着诅咒或驱魔咒文。苍白纤弱的阿珂特拉却静止在它行进路线上，任由黑焰如饥似渴地包裹全身，直至彻底吞没。法里昂搀着几近昏厥的伊莱斯无法动弹。谋杀者的弯刀已被遗忘，在这具象化的死亡面前，他们宛若即将消散的幽影。他目睹黑暗在吞噬阿珂特拉时如饱食的火焰般膨胀，泛起漩涡状的暗彩虹晕，恍若黑日光谱。须臾间，他听见火焰般的呢喃。随后那可怖存在急速退去，阿珂特拉如雾气般消融无踪。一阵冷热交织的怪风卷来刺鼻气息，宛如焚尸炉余烬。\n\n\"莫迪吉安！\"纳尔盖发出歇斯底里的尖叫，\"是食尸鬼之神莫迪吉安！他带走了阿珂特拉！\"\n\n鬣狗般的非人笑声在石壁间回荡，重复着神名作为回应。暗廊中涌出数十个紫袍生物——仅凭衣袍法里昂便认出他们是食尸鬼祭司。摘下的骷髅面具后露出半人半犬的恶魔面孔，脱去无指手套的爪钩如锈蚀金属般闪烁。至少十二个怪物将阿布农-塔与纳尔盖逼入墙角，另有几个扑向刚在炭火中苏醒呻吟的文巴-西斯。\n\n它们似乎无视了如陷噩梦的旁观者。但最后一名祭司在加入围攻前，用墓穴回声般的嘶哑声音对年轻眷侣说道：\"离去吧，莫迪吉安是公正之神，只索求死者，与生者无涉。至于那些妄图从神庙盗走尸体、亵渎神律之徒，吾等祭司自有处置之道。\"\n\n法里昂扶着伊莱斯踏入黑暗走廊，身后传来人类惨叫与鬣狗嘶吼交织的恐怖喧嚣。当他们穿过蓝光笼罩的圣所走向外廊时，喧嚣戛然而止。莫迪吉安神庙重归寂静，深沉如黑祭台上永眠的死者。"

        "content": "\n\nThasaidon, lord of seven hells Wherein the single Serpent dwells, With volumes drawn from pit to pit Through fire and darkness infinite — Thasaidon, sun of nether skies, Thine ancient evil never dies, For aye thy somber fulgors flame On sunken worlds that have no name, Man's heart enthrones thee, still supreme, Though the false sorcerers blaspheme.\n\n-- The Song of Xeethra\n\nOn Zothique, the last continent on Earth, the sun no longer shone with the whiteness of its prime, but was dim and tarnished as if with a vapor of blood. New stars without number had declared themselves in the heavens, and the shadows of the infinite had fallen closer. And out of the shadows, the older gods had returned to man: the gods forgotten since Hyperborea, since Mu and Poseidonis, bearing other names but the same attributes. And the elder demons had also returned, battening on the fumes of evil sacrifice, and fostering again the primordial sorceries.\n\nMany were the necromancers and magicians of Zothique, and the infamy and marvel of their doings were legended everywhere in the latter days. But among them all there was none greater than Namirrha, who imposed his black yoke on the cities of Xylac, and later, in a proud delirium, deemed himself the veritable peer of Thasaidon, lord of Evil.\n\nNamirrha had built his abode in Ummaos, the chief town of Xylac, to which he came from the desert realm of Tasuun with the dark renown of his thaumaturgies like a cloud of desert storm behind him. And no man knew that in coming to Ummaos he returned to the city of his birth; for all deemed him a native of Tasuun. Indeed, none could have dreamt that the great sorcerer was one with the beggar-boy Narthos, an orphan of questionable parentage, who had begged his daily bread in the streets and bazaars of Ummaos. Wretchedly had he lived, alone and despised; and a hatred of the cruel, opulent city grew in his heart like a smothered flame that feeds in secret, biding the time when it shall become a conflagration consuming all things.\n\nBitterer always, through his boyhood and early youth, was the spleen and rancor of Narthos toward men. And one day the prince Zotulla, a boy but little older than he, riding a restive palfrey, came upon him in the square before the imperial palace; and Narthos implored an alms. But Zotulla, scorning his plea, rode arrogantly forward, spurring the palfrey; and Narthos was ridden down and trampled under its hooves. And afterward, nigh to death from the trampling, he lay senseless for many hours, while the people passed him by unheeding. And at last, regaining his senses, he dragged himself to his hovel; but he limped a little thereafter all his days, and the mark of one hoof remained like a brand on his body, fading never. Later, he left Ummaos, and was forgotten quickly by its people. Going southward into Tasuun, he lost his way in the great desert, and was near to perishing. But finally he came to a small oasis, where dwelt the wizard Ouphaloc, a hermit who preferred the company of honest jackals and hyenas to that of men. And Ouphaloc, seeing the great craft and evil in the starveling boy, gave succor to Narthos and sheltered him. He dwelt for years with Ouphaloc, becoming the wizard's pupil and the heir of his demon-wrested lore. Strange things he learned in that hermitage, being fed on fruits and grain that had sprung not from the watered earth, and wine that was not the juice of terrene grapes. And like Ouphaloc, he became a master in devildom and drove his own bond with the archfiend Thasaidon. When Ouphaloc died, he took the name of Namirrha, and went forth as a mighty sorcerer among the wandering peoples and the deep-buried mummies of Tasuun. But never could he forget the miseries of his boyhood in Ummaos and the wrong he had endured from Zotulla; and year by year he spun over in his thoughts the black web of revenge. And his fame grew ever darker and vaster, and men feared him in remote lands beyond Tasuun. With bated whispers they spoke of his deeds in the cities of Yoros, and in Zul-Bha-Shair, the abode of the ghoulish deity Mordiggian. And long before the coming of Namirrha himself, the people of Ummaos knew him as a fabled scourge that was direr than simoom or pestilence.\n\nNow, in the years that followed the going-forth of the boy Narthos from Ummaos, Pithaim, the father of Prince Zotulla, was slain by the sting of a small adder that had crept into his bed for warmth on an autumn night. Some said that the adder had been purveyed by Zotulla, but this was a thing that no man could verily affirm. After the death of Pithaim, Zotulla, being his only son, was emperor of Xylac, and ruled evilly from his throne in Ummaos. Indolent he was, and tyrannic, and full of strange luxuries and cruelties; but the people, who were also evil, acclaimed him in his turpitude. So he prospered, and the lords of Hell and Heaven smote him not. And the red suns and ashen moons went westward over Xylac, falling into that seldom-voyaged sea, which, if the mariners' tales were true, poured evermore like a swiftening river past the infamous isle of Naat, and fell in a worldwide cataract upon nether space from the far, sheer edge of Earth.\n\nGrosser still he grew, and his sins were as overswollen fruits that ripen above a deep abyss. But the winds of time blew softly; and the fruits fell not. And Zotulla laughed amid his fools and his eunuchs and his lemans; and the tale of his luxuries was borne afar, and was told by dim outland peoples, as a twin marvel with the bruited necromancies of Namirrha.\n\nIt came to pass, in the year of the Hyena, and the month of the star Canicule, that a great feast was given by Zotulla to the inhabitants of Ummaos. Meats that had been cooked in exotic spices from Sotar, isle of the east, were spread everywhere; and the ardent wines of Yoros and Xylac, filled as with subterranean fires, were poured inexhaustibly from huge urns for all. The wines awoke a furious mirth and a royal madness; and afterward they brought a slumber no less profound than the Lethe of the tomb. And one by one, as they drank, the revellers fell down in the streets, the houses and gardens, as if a plague had struck them; and Zotulla slept in his banquet-hall of gold and ebony, with his odalisques and chamberlains about him. So, in all Ummaos, there was no man or woman wakeful at the hour when Sirius began to fall toward the west.\n\nThus it was that none saw or heard the coming of Namirrha. But awakening heavily in the latter forenoon, the emperor Zotulla heard a confused babble, a troublous clamor of voices from such of his eunuchs and women as had awakened before him. Inquiring the cause, he was told that a strange prodigy had occurred during the night; but, being still bemused with wine and slumber, he comprehended little enough of its nature, till his favorite concubine, Obexah, led him to the eastern portico of the palace, from which he could behold the marvel with his own eyes.\n\nNow the palace stood alone at the center of Ummaos, and to the north, west and south, for wide intervals of distance, there stretched the imperial gardens, full of superbly arching palms and loftily spiring fountains. But to eastward was a broad open area, used as a sort of common, between the palace and the mansions of high optimates. And in this space, which had lain wholly vacant at eve, a building towered colossal and lordly beneath the full-risen sun, with domes like monstrous fungi of stone that had come up in the night. And the domes, rearing level with those of Zotulla, were builded of death-white marble; and the huge façade, with multi-columned porticoes and deep balconies, was wrought in alternate zones of night-black onyx and porphyry hued as with dragons' blood. And Zotulla swore lewdly, calling with hoarse blasphemies on the gods and devils of Xylac; and great was his dumfoundment, deeming the marvel a work of wizardry. The women gathered about him, crying out with shrill cries of awe and terror; and more and more of his courtiers, awakening, came to swell the hub-bub; and the fat castradoes diddered in their cloth-of-gold like immense black jellies in golden basins. But Zotulla, mindful of his dominion as emperor of all Xylac, strove to conceal his own trepidation, saying:\n\n\"Now who is this that has presumed to enter Ummaos like a jackal in the dark, and has made his impious den in proximity and counterview of my palace? Go forth, and inquire the miscreant's name; but ere you go, instruct the headsman to make sharp his double-handed sword.\"\n\nThen, fearing the emperor's wrath if they tarried, certain of the chamberlains went forth unwillingly and approached the portals of the strange edifice. It seemed that the portals were deserted till they drew near, and then, on the threshold, there appeared a titanic skeleton, taller than any man of earth; and it strode forward to meet them with ell-long strides. The skeleton was swathed in a loin-cloth of scarlet silk with a buckle of jet, and it wore a black turban, starred with diamonds, whose topmost foldings nearly touched the high lintel. Eyes like flickering marsh-fires burned in its deep eye-sockets; and a blackened tongue like that of a long-dead man protruded between its teeth; but otherwise it was clean of flesh, and the bones glittered whitely in the sun as it came onward.\n\nThe chamberlains were mute before it, and there was no sound except the golden creaking of their girdles, the shrill rustling of their silks, as they shook and trembled. And the foot-bones of the skeleton clicked sharply on the pavement of black onyx as it paused; and the putrefying tongue began to quiver between its teeth; and it uttered these words in an unctuous, nauseous voice:\n\n\"Return, and tell the emperor Zotulla that Namirrha, seer and magician, has come to dwell beside him.\"\n\nHearing the skeleton speak as if it had been a living man, and hearing the dread name of Namirrha as men hear the tocsin of doom in some fallen city, the chamberlains could stand before it no longer, and they fled with ungainly swiftness and bore the message to Zotulla.\n\nNow, learning who it was that had come to neighbor with him in Ummaos, the emperor's wrath died out like a feeble and blustering flame on which the wind of darkness had blown; and the vinous purple of his cheeks was mottled with a strange pallor; and he said nothing, but his lips mumbled loosely as if in prayer or malediction. And the news of Namirrha's coming passed like the flight of evil night-birds through all the palace and throughout the city, leaving a noisome terror that abode in Ummaos thereafter till the end. For Namirrha, through the black renown of his thaumaturgies and the frightful entities who served him, had become a power that no secular sovereign dared dispute; and men feared him everywhere, even as they feared the gigantic, shadowy lords of Hell and of outer space. And in Ummaos, people said that he had come on the desert wind from Tasuun with his underlings, even as the pestilence comes, and had reared his house in an hour with the aid of devils beside Zotulla's palace. And they said that the foundations of the house were laid on the adamantine cope of Hell; and in its floors were pits at whose bottom burned the nether fires, or stars could be seen as they passed under in lowermost night. And the followers of Namirrha were the dead of strange kingdoms, the demons of sky and earth and the abyss, and mad, impious, hybrid things that the sorcerer himself created from forbidden unions.\n\nMen shunned the neighborhood of his lordly house; and in the palace of Zotulla few cared to approach the windows and balconies that gave thereon; and the emperor himself spoke not of Namirrha, pretending to ignore the intruder; and the women of the harem babbled evermore with an evil gossip concerning Namirrha and his concubines. But the sorcerer himself was not beheld by the people of that city, though some believed that he walked forth at will, clad with invisibility. His servitors were likewise not seen; but a howling as of the damned was sometimes heard to issue from his portals; and sometimes there came a strange cachinnation, as if some adamantine image had laughed aloud; and sometimes there was a chuckling like the sound of shattered ice in a frozen hell. Dim shadows moved in the porticoes when there was neither sunlight nor lamp to cast them; and red, eery lights appeared and vanished in the windows at eve, like a blinking of demoniac eyes. And slowly the ember-colored suns went over Xylac, and were quenched in far seas; and the ashy moons were blackened as they fell nightly toward the hidden gulf. Then, seeing that the wizard had wrought no open evil, and that none had endured palpable harm from his presence, the people took heart; and Zotulla drank deeply, and feasted in oblivious luxury as before; and dark Thasaidon, prince of all turpitudes, was the true but never-acknowledged lord of Xylac. And in time the men of Ummaos bragged a little of Namirrha and his dread thaumaturgies, even as they had boasted of the purple sins of Zotulla.\n\nBut Namirrha, still unbeheld by living men and living women, sat in the inner walls of that house which his devils had reared for him, and spun over and over in his thoughts the black web of revenge. And the wrong done by Zotulla to Narthos in old times was the least of those cruelties which the emperor had forgotten.\n\nNow, when the fears of Zotulla were somewhat lulled, and his women gossiped less often of the neighboring wizard, there occurred a new wonder and a fresh terror. For, sitting one eve at his banquet-table with his courtiers about him, the emperor heard a noise as of myriad iron-shod hooves that came trampling through the palace gardens. And the courtiers also heard the sound, and were startled amid their mounting drunkenness; and the emperor was angered, and he sent certain of his guards to examine into the cause of the trampling. But peering forth upon the moon-bright lawns and parterres, the guards beheld no visible shape, though the loud sounds of trampling still went to and fro. It seemed as if a rout of wild stallions passed and re-passed before the façade of the palace with tumultuous gallopings and capricoles. And a fear came upon the guards as they looked and listened; and they dared not venture forth, but returned to Zotulla. And the emperor himself grew sober when he heard their tale; and he went forth with high blusterings to view the prodigy. And all night the unseen hooves rang out sonorously on the pavement of onyx, and ran with deep thuddings over the grasses and flowers. The palm-fronds waved on the windless air as if parted by racing steeds; and visibly the tall-stemmed lilies and broad-petaled exotic blossoms were trodden under. And rage and terror nested together in Zotulla's heart as he stood in a balcony above the garden, hearing the spectral tumult, and beholding the harm done to his rarest flower-beds. The women, the courtiers and eunuchs cowered behind him, and there was no slumber for any occupant of the palace; but toward dawn the clamor of hooves departed, going toward Namirrha's house.\n\nWhen the dawn was full-grown above Ummaos, the emperor walked forth with his guards about him, and saw that the crushed grasses and broken-down stems were blackened as if by fire where the hooves had fallen. Plainly were the marks imprinted, like the tracks of a great company of horses, in all the lawns and parterres; but they ceased at the verge of the gardens. And though everyone believed that the visitation had come from Namirrha, there was no proof of this in the grounds that fronted the sorcerer's abode; for here the turf was untrodden.\n\n\"A pox upon Namirrha, if he has done this!\" cried Zotulla. \"For what harm have I ever done him? Verily, I shall set my heel on the dog's neck; and the torture-wheel shall serve him even as these horses from Hell have served my blood-red lilies of Sotar and my vein-colored irises of Naat and my orchids from Uccastrog which were purple as the bruises of love. Yea, though he stand the viceroy of Thasaidon above Earth, and overlord of ten thousand devils, my wheel shall break him, and fires shall heat the wheel white-hot in its turning, till he withers black as the seared blossoms.\" Thus did Zotulla make his brag; but he issued no orders for the execution of his threat; and no man stirred from the palace towards Namirrha's house. And from the portals of the wizard none came forth; or if any came there was no visible sign or sound.\n\nSo the day went over, and the night rose, bringing later a moon that was slightly darkened at the rim. And the night was silent; and Zotulla, sitting long at the banquet-table, drained his wine-cup often and wrathfully, muttering new threats against Namirrha. And the night wore on, and it seemed that the visitation would not be repeated. But at midnight, lying in his chamber with Obexah, and fathom-deep in his slumber from the wine, Zotulla was awakened by a monstrous clangor of hooves that raced and capered in the palace porticoes and in the long balconies. All night the hooves thundered back and forth, echoing awfully in the vaulted stone, while Zotulla and Obexah, listening, huddled close amid their cushions and coverlets; and all the occupants of the palace, wakeful and fearful, heard the noise but stirred not from their chambers. A little before dawn the hooves departed suddenly; and afterward, by day, their marks were found found on the marble flags of the porches and balconies; and the marks were countless, deep-graven, and black as if branded there by flame.\n\nLike mottled marble were the emperor's cheeks when he saw the hoof-printed floors; and terror stayed with him henceforth, following him to the depths of his inebriety, since he knew not where the haunting would cease. His women murmured and some wished to flee from Ummaos, and it seemed that the revels of the day and evening were shadowed by ill wings that left their umbrage in the yellow wine and bedimmed the aureate lamps. And again, toward midnight, the slumber of Zotulla was broken by the hooves, which came galloping and pacing on the palace-roof and through all the corridors and the halls. Thereafter, till dawn, the hooves filled the palace with their iron clatterings, and they rung hollowly on the topmost domes, as if the coursers of gods had trodden there, passing from heaven to heaven in tumultuous cavalcade.\n\nZotulla and Obexah, lying together while the terrible hooves went to and fro in the hall outside their chamber, had no heart or thought for sin, nor could they find any comfort in their nearness. In the gray hour before dawn they heard a great thundering high on the barred brazen door of the room, as if some mighty stallion, rearing, had drummed there with his forefeet. And soon after this, the hooves went away, leaving a silence like an interlude in some gathering storm of doom. Later, the marks of the hooves were found everywhere in the halls, marring the bright mosaics. Black holes were burnt in the golden-threaded rugs and the rugs of silver and scarlet; and the high white domes were pitted pox-wise with the marks; and far up on the brazen door of Zotulla's chamber the prints of a horse's forefeet were incised deeply.\n\nNow, in Ummaos, and throughout Xylac, the tale of this haunting became known, and the thing was deemed an ominous prodigy, though people differed in their interpretations. Some held that the sending came from Namirrha, and was meant as a token of his supremacy above all kings and emperors; and some thought that it came from a new wizard who had risen in Tinarath, far to the east, and who wished to supplant Namirrha. And the priests of the gods of Xylac held that their various deities had dispatched the haunting, as a sign that more sacrifices were required in the temples.\n\nThen, in his hall of audience, whose floor of sard and jasper had been grievously pocked by the unseen hooves, Zotulla called together many priests and magicians and soothsayers, and asked them to declare the cause of the sending and devise a mode of exorcism. But, seeing that there was no agreement among them, Zotulla provided the several priestly sects with the wherewithal of sacrifice to their sundry gods, and sent them away; and the wizards and prophets, under threat of decapitation if they refused, were enjoined to visit Namirrha in his mansion of sorcery and learn his will, if haply the sending were his and not the work of another.\n\nLoth were the wizards and the soothsayers, fearing Namirrha, and caring not to intrude upon the frightful mysteries of his obscure mansion. But the swordsmen of the emperor drove them forth, lifting great crescent blades against them when they tarried; so one by one, in a straggling order, the delegation went towards Namirrha's portals and vanished into the devil-builded house.\n\nPale, muttering and distraught, like men who have looked upon hell and have seen their doom, they returned before sunset to the emperor. And they said that Namirrha had received them courteously and had sent them back with this message:\n\n\"Be it known to Zotulla that the haunting is a sign of that which he has long forgotten; and the reason of the haunting will be revealed to him at the hour prepared and set apart by destiny. And the hour draws near: for Namirrha bids the emperor and all his court to a great feast on the afternoon of the morrow.\"\n\nHaving delivered this message, to the wonder and consternation of Zotulla, the delegation begged his leave to depart. And though the emperor questioned them minutely, they seemed unwilling to relate the circumstances of the visit to Namirrha; nor would they describe the sorcerer's fabled house, except in a vague manner, each contradicting the other as to what he had seen. So, after a little, Zotulla bade them go, and when they had gone he sat musing for a long while on the invitation of Namirrha, which was a thing he cared not to accept but feared to decline. That evening he drank even more liberally than was his wont; and he slept a Lethean slumber, nor was there any noise of trampling hooves about the palace to awaken him. And silently, during the night, the prophets and magicians passed like furtive shadows from Ummaos; and no man saw them depart; and at morning they were gone from Xylac into other lands, never to return....\n\nNow, on that same evening, in the great hall of his house, Namirrha sat alone, having dismissed the familiars who attended him ordinarily. Before him, on an altar of jet, was the dark, gigantic statue of Thasaidon which a devil-begotten sculptor had wrought in ancient days for an evil king of Tasuun, called Pharnoc. The archdemon was depicted in the guise of a full-armored warrior, lifting a spiky mace as if in heroic battle. Long had the statue lain in the desert-sunken palace of Pharnoc, whose very site was disputed by the nomads; and Namirrha, by his divination, had found it and had reared up the infernal image to abide with him always thereafter. And often, through the mouth of the statue, Thasaidon would utter oracles to Namirrha, or would answer interrogations.\n\nBefore the black-armored image there hung seven silver lamps, wrought in the form of horses' skulls, with flames issuing changeably in blue and purple and crimson from their eye-sockets. Wild and lurid was their light, and the face of the demon, peering from under his crested helmet, was filled with malign, equivocal shadows that shifted and changed eternally. And sitting in his serpent-carven chair, Namirrha regarded the statue grimly, with a deep-furrowed frown between his eyes: for he had asked a certain thing of Thasaidon, and the fiend, replying through the statue, had refused him. And rebellion was in the heart of Namirrha, grown mad with pride, and deeming himself the lord of all sorcerers and a ruler by his own right among the princes of devildom. So, after long pondering, he repeated his request in a bold and haughty voice, like one who addresses an equal rather than the all-formidable suzerain to whom he had sworn a fatal fealty.\n\n\"I have helped you heretofore in all things,\" said the image, with stony and sonorous accents that were echoed metallically in the seven silver lamps. \"Yea, the undying worms of fire and darkness have come forth like an army at your summons, and the wings of nether genii have risen to occlude the sun when you called them. But, verily, I will not aid you in this vengeance you have planned: for the emperor Zotulla has done me no wrong and has served me well though unwittingly; and the people of Xylac, by reason of their turpitudes, are not the least of my terrestial worshippers. Therefore, Namirrha, it were well for you to live in peace with Zotulla, and well to forget this olden wrong that was done to the beggar-boy Narthos. For the ways of destiny are strange, and the workings of its laws sometimes hidden; and truly, if the hooves of Zotulla's palfrey had not spurned you and trodden you under, your life had been otherwise, and the name and renown of Namirrha had still slept in oblivion as a dream undreamed. Yea, you would tarry still as a beggar in Ummaos, content with a beggar's guerdon, and would never have fared forth to become the pupil of the wise and learned Ouphaloc; and I, Thasaidon, would have lost the lordliest of all necromancers who have accepted my service and my bond. Think well, Namirrha, and ponder these matters: for both of us, it would seem, are indebted to Zotulla in all gratitude for the trampling he gave you.\"\n\n\"Yea, there is a debt,\" Namirrha growled implacably. \"And truly I will pay the debt tomorrow, even as I have planned.... There are Those who will aid me, Those who will answer my summoning in your despite.\"\n\n\"It is an ill thing to affront me,\" said the image, after an interval. \"And also, it is not wise to call upon Those that you designate. However, I perceive clearly that such is your intent. You are proud and stubborn and revengeful. Do then, as you will, but blame me not for the outcome.\"\n\nSo, after this, there was silence in the hall where Namirrha sat before the eidolon; and the flames burned darkly, with changeable colors, in the skull-shapen lamps; and the shadows fled and returned, unresting, on the face of the statue and the face of Namirrha. Then, toward midnight, the necromancer arose and went upward by many spiral stairs to a high dome of his house in which there was a single small round window that looked forth on the constellations. The window was set in the top of the dome; but Namirrha had contrived, by means of his magic, that one entering by the last spiral of the stairs would suddenly seem to descend rather than climb, and, reaching the last step, would peer downward through the window while stars passed under him in a giddying gulf. There, kneeling, Namirrha touched a secret spring in the marble, and the circular pane slid back without sound. Then, lying prone on the interior of the dome, with his face over the abyss, and his long beard trailing stiffly into space, he whispered a pre-human rune, and held speech with certain entities who belonged neither to Hell nor the mundane elements, and were more fearsome to invoke than the infernal genii or the devils of earth, air, water, and flame. With them he made his contract, defying Thasaidon's will, while the air curdled about him with their voices, and rime gathered palely on his sable beard from the cold that was wrought by their breathing as they leaned earthward.\n\nLaggard and loth was the awakening of Zotulla from his wine; and quickly, ere he opened his eyes, the daylight was poisoned for him by the thought of that invitation which he feared to accept or decline. But he spoke to Obexah, saying:\n\n\"Who, after all, is this wizardly dog, that I should obey his summons like a beggar called in from the street by some haughty lord?\"\n\nObexah, a golden-skinned and oblique-eyed girl from Uccastrog, Isle of the Torturers, eyed the emperor subtly, and said:\n\n\"O Zotulla, it is yours to accept or refuse, as you deem fitting. And truly, it is a small matter for the lord of Ummaos and all Xylac, whether to go or to stay, since naught can impugn his sovereignty. Therefore, were it not as well to go?\" For Obexah, though fearful of the wizard, was curious regarding that devil-builded house of which so little was known; and likewise, in the manner of women, she wished to behold the famed Namirrha, whose mien and appearance were still but a far-brought legend in Ummaos.\n\n\"There is something in what you say,\" admitted Zotulla. \"But an emperor, in his conduct, must always consider the public good; and there are matters of state involved, which a woman can scarcely be expected to understand.\"\n\nSo, later in the forenoon, after an ample and well-irrigated breakfast, he called his chamberlains and courtiers about him and took counsel with them. And some advised him to ignore the invitation of Namirrha; and others held that the invitation be accepted, lest a graver evil than the trampling of ghostly hooves be sent upon the palace and the city.\n\nThen Zotulla called the many priesthoods before him in a body, and sought to resummon the wizards and soothsayers who had fled privily in the night. Among all the latter, there was none who answered the crying of his name through Ummaos; and this aroused a certain wonder. But the priests came in a greater number than before, and thronged the hall of audience so that the paunches of the foremost were straightened against the imperial dais and the buttocks of the hindmost were flattened on the rear walls and pillars. And Zotulla debated with them the matter of acceptance or refusal. And the priests argued, as before, that Namirrha was nowherewise concerned with the sending ; and his invitation, they said, portended no harm nor bale to the emperor; and it was plain, from the terms of the message, that an oracle would be imparted to Zotulla by the wizard; and this oracle, if Namirrha were a true archimage, would confirm their own holy wisdom and reëstablish the divine source of the sending; and the gods of Xylac would again be glorified.\n\nThen, having heard the pronouncement of the priests, the emperor instructed his treasurers to load them down with new offerings; and calling unctuously upon Zotulla and all his household the vicarious blessings of the several gods, the priests departed. And the day wore on, and the sun passed its meridian, falling slowly beyond Ummaos through the spaces of the afternoon that were floored with sea-ending deserts. And still Zotulla was irresolute; and he called his wine-bearers, bidding them pour for him the strongest and most magistral of their vintages; but in the wine he found neither certitude nor decision.\n\nSitting still on his throne in the hall of audience, he heard, toward middle afternoon, a mighty and clamorous outcry that arose at the palace portals. There were deep wailings of men and the shrillings of eunuchs and women, as if terror passed from tongue to tongue, invading the halls and apartments. And the fearful clamor spread throughout all the palace, and Zotulla, rousing from the lethargy of wine, was about to send his attendants to inquire the cause.\n\nThen, into the hall, there filed an array of tall mummies, clad in royal cerements of purple and scarlet, and wearing gold crowns on their withered craniums. And after them, like servitors, came gigantic skeletons who wore loin-cloths of nacarat orange and about whose upper skulls, from brow to crown, live serpents of banded saffron and ebon had wrapped themselves for head-dresses. And the mummies bowed before Zotulla, saying with thin, sere voices:\n\n\"We, who were kings of the wide realm of Tasuun aforetime, have been sent as a guard of honor for the emperor Zotulla, to attend him as is befitting when he goes forth to the feast prepared by Namirrha.\"\n\nThen with dry clickings of their teeth, and whistlings as of air through screens of fretted ivory, the skeletons spoke:\n\n\"We, who were giant warriors of a race forgotten, have also been sent by Namirrha, so that the emperor's household, following him to the feast, should be guarded from all peril and should fare forth in such pageantry as is meet and proper.\"\n\nWitnessing these prodigies, the wine-bearers and other attendants cowered about the imperial dais or hid behind the pillars, while Zotulla, with pupils swimming starkly in a bloodshot white, with face bloated and ghastly pale, sat frozen on his throne and could utter no word in reply to the ministers of Namirrha.\n\nThen, coming forward, the mummies said in dusty accents: \"All is made ready, and the feast awaits the arrival of Zotulla.\" And the cerements of the mummies stirred and fell open at the bosom, and small rodent monsters, brown as bitumen, eyed as with accursed rubies, reared forth from the eaten hearts of the mummies like rats from their holes and chittered shrilly in human speech, repeating the words. The skeletons in turn took up the solemn sentence; and the black and saffron serpents hissed it from their skulls; and the words were repeated lastly in baleful rumblings by certain furry creatures of dubious form, hitherto unseen by Zotulla, who sat behind the ribs of the skeletons as if in cages of white wicker.\n\nLike a dreamer who obeys the doom of dreams, the emperor rose from his throne and went forward, and the mummies surrounded him like an escort. And each of the skeletons drew from the reddish-yellow folds of his loin-cloth a curiously pierced archaic flute of silver; and all began a sweet and evil and deathly fluting as the emperor went out through the halls of the palace. A fatal spell was in the music: for the chamberlains, the women, the guards, the eunuchs, and all members of Zotulla's household even to the cooks and scullions, were drawn like a procession of night-walkers from the rooms and alcoves in which they had vainly hidden themselves; and marshaled by the flutists, they followed after Zotulla. A strange thing it was to behold this mighty company of people, going forth in the slanted sunlight toward Namirrha's house, with a cortège of dead kings about them, and the blown breath of skeletons thrilling eldritchly in the silver flutes. And little was Zotulla comforted when he found the girl Obexah at his side, moving, as he, in a thralldom of involitent horror, with the rest of his women close behind.\n\nComing to the open portals of Namirrha's house, the emperor saw that they were guarded by great crimson-wattled things, half dragon, half man, who bowed before him, sweeping their wattles like bloody besoms on the flags of dark onyx. And the emperor passed with Obexah between the louting monsters, with the mummies, the skeletons and his own people behind him in strange pageant, and entered a vast and multicolumned hall, where the daylight, following timidly, was drowned by the baleful arrogant blaze of a thousand lamps.\n\nEven amid his horror, Zotulla marvelled at the vastness of the chamber, which he could hardly reconcile with the mansion's outer length and height and breadth, though these indeed were of most palatial amplitude. For it seemed that he gazed down great avenues of topless pillars, and vistas of tables laden with piled-up viands and thronged urns of wine, that stretched away before him into luminous distance and gloom as of starless night.\n\nIn the wide intervals between the tables, the familiars of Namirrha and his other servants went to and fro incessantly, as if a fantasmagoria of ill dreams were embodied before the emperor. Kingly cadavers in robes of time-rotted brocade, with worms seething in their eye-pits, poured a blood-like wine into cups of the opalescent horn of unicorns. Lamias, trident-tailed, and four-breasted chimeras, came in with fuming platters lifted high by their brazen claws. Dog-headed devils, tongued with lolling flames, ran forward to offer themselves as ushers for the company. And before Zotulla and Obexah, there appeared a curious being with the full-fleshed lower limbs and hips of a great black woman and the clean-picked bones of some titanic ape from thereupward.\n\nVerily, it seemed to Zotulla that they had gone a long way into some malignly litten cavern of Hell, when they came to that perspective of tables and columns down which the monster had led them. Here, at the room's end, apart from the rest, was a table at which Namirrha sat alone, with the flames of the seven horse-skull lamps burning restlessly behind him, and the mailed black image of Thasaidon towering from the altar of jet at his right hand. And a little aside from the altar, a diamond mirror was upborne by the claws of iron basilisks.\n\nNamirrha rose to greet them, observing a solemn and funereal courtesy. His eyes were bleak and cold as distant stars in the hollows wrought by strange fearful vigils. His lips were like a pale-red seal on a shut parchment of doom. His beard flowed stiffly in black-anointed banded locks across the bosom of his vermilion robe, like a mass of straight black serpents. Zotulla felt the blood pause and thicken about his heart, as if congealing into ice. And Obexah, peering beneath lowered lids, was abashed and frightened by the visible horror that invested this man and hung upon him even as royalty upon a king. But amid her fear, she found room to wonder what manner of man he was in his intercourse with women.\n\n\"I bid you welcome, O Zotulla, to such hospitality as is mine to offer,\" said Namirrha, with the iron ringing of some hidden funereal bell deep down in his hollow voice. \"Prithee, be seated at my table.\"\n\nZotulla saw that a chair of ebony had been placed for him opposite Namirrha; and another chair, less stately and imperial, had been placed at the left hand for Obexah. And the twain seated themselves; and Zotulla saw that his people were sitting likewise at other tables throughout the huge hall, with the frightful servants of Namirrha waiting upon them busily, like devils attending the damned.\n\nThen Zotulla perceived that a dark and corpse-like hand was pouring wine for him in a crystal cup; and upon the hand was the signet-ring of the emperors of Xylac, set with a monstrous fire-opal in the mouth of a golden bat: even such a ring as Zotulla wore perpetually on his index-finger. And, turning, he beheld at his right hand a figure that bore the likeness of his father, Pithaim, after the poison of the adder, spreading through his limbs, had left behind it the purple bloating of death. And Zotulla, who had caused the adder to be placed in the bed of Pithaim, cowered in his seat and trembled with a guilty fear. And the thing that wore the similtude of Pithaim, whether corpse or an image wrought by Namirrha's enchantment, came and went at Zotulla's elbow, waiting upon him with stark, black, swollen fingers that never fumbled. Horribly he was aware of its bulging, unregarding eyes, and its livid purple mouth that was locked in a rigor of mortal silence, and the spotted adder that peered at intervals with chill orbs from its heavy-folded sleeve as it leaned beside him to replenish his cup or to serve him with meat. And dimly, through the icy mist of his terror, the emperor beheld the shadowy-armored shape, like a moving replica of the still, grim statue of Thasaidon, which Namirrha had reared up in his blasphemy to perform the same office for himself. And vaguely, without comprehension, he saw the dreadful ministrant that hovered beside Obexah: a flayed and eyeless corpse in the image of her first lover, a boy from Cyntrom who had been cast ashore in shipwreck on the Isle of the Torturers. There Obexah had found him, lying behind the ebbing wave, and reviving the boy, she had hidden him awhile in a secret cave for her own pleasure, and had brought him food and drink. Later, wearying, she had betrayed him to the Torturers, and had taken a new delight in the various pangs and ordeals inflicted upon him before death by that cruel, pernicious people.\n\n\"Drink,\" said Namirrha, quaffing a strange wine that was red and dark as if with disastrous sunsets of lost years. And Zotulla and Obexah drank the wine, feeling no warmth in their veins thereafter, but a chill as of hemlock mounting slowly toward the heart.\n\n\"Verily, 'tis a good wine,\" said Namirrha, \"and a proper one in which to toast the furthering of our acquaintance: for it was buried long ago with the royal dead, in amphorae of somber jasper shapen like funeral urns; and my ghouls found it, whenas they came to dig in Tasuun.\"\n\nNow it seemed that the tongue of Zotulla froze in his mouth, as a mandrake freezes in the rime-bound soil of winter; and he found no reply to Namirrha's courtesy.\n\n\"Prithee, make trial of this meat,\" quoth Namirrha, \"for it is very choice, being the flesh of that boar which the Torturers of Uccastrog are wont to pasture on the well-minced leavings of their wheels and racks; and, moreover, my cooks have spiced it with the powerful balsams of the tomb, and have farced it with the hearts of adders and the tongues of black cobras.\"\n\nNaught could the emperor say; and even Obexah was silent, being sorely troubled in her turpitude by the presence of that flayed and piteous thing which had the likeness of her lover from Cyntrom. And the dread of the necromancer grew prodigiously; for his knowledge of this old, forgotten crime, and the raising of the fantasm, appeared to her a more baleful magic than all else.\n\n\"Now, I fear,\" said Namirrha, \"that you find the meat devoid of savor, and the wine without fire. So, to enliven our feasting, I shall call forth my singers and my musicians.\"\n\nHe spoke a word unknown to Zotulla or Obexah, which sounded throughout the mighty hall as if a thousand voices in turn had taken it up and prolonged it. Anon there appeared the singers, who were she-ghouls with shaven bodies and hairy shanks, and long yellow tushes full of shredded carrion curving across their chaps from mouths that fawned hyena-wise on the company. Behind them entered the musicians, some of whom were male devils pacing erect on the hind-quarters of sable stallions and plucking with the fingers of white apes at lyres of the bone and sinew of cannibals from Naat; and others were pied satyrs puffing their goatish cheeks at hautboys formed from the bosom-skin of Negro queens and the horn of rhinoceri.\n\nThey bowed before Namirrha with grotesque ceremony. Then, without delay, the she-ghouls began a most dolorous and execrable howling, as of jackals that have sniffed their carrion; and the satyrs and devils played a lament that was like the moaning of desert-born winds through forsaken palace harems. And Zotulla shivered, for the singing filled his marrow with ice, and the music left in his heart a desolation as of empires fallen and trod under by the iron-shod hooves of time. Ever, amid that evil music, he seemed to hear the sifting of sand across withered gardens, and the windy rustling of rotted silks upon couches of bygone luxury, and the hissing of coiled serpents from the low fusts of shattered columns. And the glory that had been Ummaos seemed to pass away like the blown pillars of the simoom.\n\n\"Now that was a brave tune,\" said Namirrha when the music ceased and the she-ghouls no longer howled. \"But verily I fear that you find my entertainment somewhat dull. Therefore, my dancers shall dance for you.\"\n\nHe turned toward the great hall, and described in the air an enigmatic sign with the fingers of his right hand. In answer to the sign, a hueless mist came down from the high roof and hid the room like a fallen curtain for a brief interim. There was a babel of sounds, confused and muffled, beyond the curtain, and a crying of voices faint as if with distance.\n\nThen, dreadfully, the vapor rolled away, and Zotulla saw that the leaden tables had gone. In the wide interspaces of the columns, his palace-inmates, the chamberlains, the eunuchs, the courtiers and odalisques and all the others, lay trussed with thongs on the floor, like so many fowls of glorious plumage. Above them, in time to a music made by the lyrists and flutists of the necromancer, a troupe of skeletons pirouetted with light clickings of their toe-bones; and a rout of mummies bowed stiffly; and others of Namirrha's creatures moved with mysterious caperings. To and fro they leapt on the bodies of the emperor's people, in the paces of an evil saraband. At every step they grew taller and heavier, till the saltant mummies were as the mummies of Anakim, and the skeletons were boned as colossi; and louder the music rose, drowning the faint cries of Zotulla's people. And huger still became the dancers, towering far into vaulted shadow among the vast columns, with thudding feet that wrought thunder in the room; and those whereon they danced were as grapes trampled for a vintage in autumn; and the floor ran deep with a sanguine must.\n\nAs a man drowning in a noisome, night-bound fen, the emperor heard the voice of Namirrha:\n\n\"It would seem that my dancers please you not. So now I shall present you a most royal spectacle. Arise and follow me, for the spectacle is one that requires an empire for its stage.\"\n\nZotulla and Obexah rose from their chairs in the fashion of night-walkers. Giving no backward glance at their ministering phantoms, or the hall where the dancers bounded, they followed Namirrha to an alcove beyond the altar of Thasaidon. Thence, by the upward-coiling stairways, they came at length to a broad high balcony that faced Zotulla's palace and looked forth above the city roofs toward the bourn of sunset.\n\nIt seemed that several hours had gone by in that hellish feasting and entertainment; for the day was near to its close, and the sun, which had fallen from sight behind the imperial palace, was barring the vast heavens with bloody rays.\n\n\"Behold,\" said Namirrha, adding a strange vocable to which the stone of the edifice resounded like a beaten gong.\n\nThe balcony pitched a little, and Zotulla, looking over the balustrade, beheld the roofs of Ummaos lessen and sink beneath him. It seemed that the balcony flew skyward to a prodigious height, and he peered down across the domes of his own palace, upon the houses, the tilled fields and the desert beyond, and the huge sun brought low on the desert's verge. And Zotulla grew giddy; and the chill airs of the upper heavens blew upon him. But Namirrha spoke another word, and the balcony ceased to ascend.\n\n\"Look well,\" said the necromancer, \"on the empire that was yours, but shall be yours no longer.\" Then, with arms outstretched toward the sunset, he called aloud the twelve names that were perdition to utter, and after them the tremendous invocation: Gna padambis devompra thungis furidor avoragomon.\n\nInstantly, it seemed that great ebon clouds of thunder beetled against the sun. Lining the horizon, the clouds took the form of colossal monsters with heads and members somewhat resembling those of stallions. Rearing terribly, they trod down the sun like an extinguished ember; and racing as if in some hippodrome of Titans, they rose higher and vaster, coming towards Ummaos. Deep, calamitous rumblings preceded them, and the earth shook visibly, till Zotulla saw that these were not immaterial clouds, but actual living forms that had come forth to tread the world in macrocosmic vastness. Throwing their shadows for many leagues before them, the coursers charged as if devil-ridden into Xylac, and their feet descended like falling mountain crags upon far oases and towns of the outer wastes.\n\nLike a many-turreted storm they came, and it seemed that the world shrank gulfward, tilting beneath the weight. Still as a man enchanted into marble, Zotulla stood and beheld the ruining that was wrought on his empire. And closer drew the gigantic stallions, racing with inconceivable speed, and louder was the thundering of their footfalls, that now began to blot the green fields and fruited orchards lying for many miles to the west of Ummaos. And the shadow of the stallions climbed like an evil gloom of eclipse, till it covered Ummaos; and looking up, the emperor saw their eyes halfway between earth and zenith, like baleful suns that glare down from soaring cumuli.\n\nThen, in the thickening gloom, above that insupportable thunder, he heard the voice of Namirrha, crying in mad triumph:\n\n\"Know, Zotulla, that I have called up the coursers of Thamogorgos, lord of the abyss. And the coursers will tread your empire down, even as your palfrey trod and trampled in former time a beggar-boy named Narthos. And learn also that I, Namirrha, was that boy.\" And the eyes of Namirrha, filled with a vainglory of madness and bale, burned like malign, disastrous stars at the hour of their culmination.\n\nTo Zotulla, wholly mazed with the horror and tumult, the necromancer's words were no more than shrill, shrieked overtones of the tempest of doom; and he understood them not. Tremendously, with a rending of staunch-built roofs, and an instant cleavage and crumbling down of mighty masonries, the hooves descended upon Ummaos. Fair temple-domes were pashed like shells of the haliotis, and haughty mansions were broken and stamped into the ground even as gourds; and house by house the city was trampled flat with a crashing as of worlds beaten into chaos. Far below, in the darkened streets, men and camels fled like scurrying emmets but could not escape. And implacably the hooves rose and fell, till ruin was upon half the city, and night was over all. The palace of Zotulla was trodden under, and now the forelegs of the coursers loomed level with Namirrha's balcony, and their heads towered awfully above. It seemed that they would rear and trample down the necromancer's house; but at that moment they parted to left and right, and a dolorous glimmering came from the low sunset; and the coursers went on, treading under them that portion of Ummaos which lay to the eastward. And Zotulla and Obexah and Namirrha looked down on the city's fragments as on a shard-strewn midden, and heard the cataclysmic clamor of the hooves departing toward eastern Xylac.\n\n\"Now that was a goodly spectacle,\" quoth Namirrha. Then, turning to the emperor, he added malignly: \"Think not that I have done with thee, however, or that doom is yet consummate.\"\n\nIt seemed that the balcony had fallen to its former elevation, which was still a lofty vantage above the sharded ruins. And Namirrha plucked the emperor by the arm and led him from the balcony to an inner chamber, while Obexah followed mutely. The emperor's heart was crushed within him by the trampling of such calamities, and despair weighed upon him like a foul incubus on the shoulders of a man lost in some land of accursed night. And he knew not that he had been parted from Obexah on the threshold of the chamber, and that certain of Namirrha's creatures, appearing like shadows, had compelled the girl to go downward with them by the stairs, and had stifled her outcries with their rotten cerements as they went.\n\nThe chamber was one that Namirrha used for his most unhallowed rites and alchemies. The rays of the lamps that illumed it were saffron-red like the spilt ichor of devils, and they flowed on aludels and crucibles and black athanors and alembics whereof the purpose was hardly to be named by mortal man. The sorcerer heated in one of the alembics a dark liquid full of star-cold lights, while Zotulla looked on unheeding. And when the liquid bubbled and sent forth a spiral vapor, Namirrha distilled it into goblets of gold-rimmed iron, and gave one of the goblets to Zotulla and retained the other himself. And he said to Zotulla with a stern imperative voice: \"I bid thee quaff this liquor.\"\n\nZotulla, fearing that the draft was poison, hesitated. And the necromancer regarded him with a lethal gaze, and cried loudly: \"Fearest thou to do as I?\" and therewith he set the goblet to his lips.\n\nSo the emperor drank the draft, constrained as if by the bidding of some angel of death, and a darkness fell upon his senses. But, ere the darkness grew complete, he saw that Namirrha had drained his own goblet.\n\nThen, with unspeakable agonies, it seemed that the emperor died; and his soul float free; and again he saw the chamber, though with bodiless eyes. And discarnate he stood in the saffron-crimson light, with his body lying as if dead on the floor beside him, and near it the prone body of Namirrha and the two fallen goblets.\n\nStanding thus, he beheld a strange thing: for anon his own body stirred and arose, while that of the necromancer remained still as death. And Zotulla looked at his own lineaments and his figure in its short cloak of azure samite sewn with black pearls and balas-rubies; and the body lived before him, though with eyes that held a darker fire and a deeper evil than was their wont. Then, without corporeal ears, Zotulla heard the figure speak, and the voice was the strong, arrogant voice of Namirrha, saying:\n\n\"Follow me, O houseless phantom, and do in all things as I enjoin thee.\"\n\nLike an unseen shadow, Zotulla followed the wizard, and the twain went downward by the stairs to the great banquet hall. They came to the altar of Thasaidon and the mailed image, with the seven horse-skull lamps burning before it as formerly. Upon the altar, Zotulla's beloved leman Obexah, who alone of all women had power to stir his sated heart, was lying bound with thongs at Thasaidon's feet. But the hall beyond was deserted, and nothing remained of that Saturnalia of doom except the fruit of the treading, which had flowed together in dark pools among the columns.\n\nNamirrha, using the emperor's body in all ways for his own, paused before the dark eidolon; and he said to the spirit of Zotulla: \"Be imprisoned in this image, without power to free thyself or to stir in any wise.\"\n\nBeing wholly obedient to the will of the necromancer, the soul of Zotulla was embodied in the statue, and he felt its cold, gigantic armor about him like a straight sarcophagus, and he peered forth immovably from the bleak eyes that were overhung by its carven helmet.\n\nGazing thus, he beheld the change that had come on his own body through the sorcerous possession of Namirrha: for below the short azure cloak, the legs had turned suddenly to the hind legs of a black stallion, with hooves that glowed redly as if heated by infernal fires. And even as Zotulla watched this prodigy, the hooves glowed white and incandescent, and fumes mounted from the floor beneath them.\n\nThen, on the black altar, the hybrid abomination came pacing haughtily toward Obexah, and smoking footprints appeared behind it as it came. Pausing beside the girl, who lay supine and helpless regarding it with eyes that were pools of frozen horror, it raised one glowing hoof and set the hoof on her naked bosom between the small breast-cups of golden filigree begemmed with rubies. And the girl screamed beneath that atrocious treading as the soul of one newly damned might scream in hell; and the hoof glared with intolerable brilliance, as if freshly plucked from a furnace wherein the weapons of demons were forged.\n\nAt that moment, in the cowed and crushed and sodden shade of the emperor Zotulla, close-locked within the adamantine image, there awoke the manhood that had slumbered unaroused before the ruining of his empire and the trampling of his retinue. Immediately a great abhorrence and a high wrath were alive in his soul, and mightily he longed for his own right arm to serve him, and a sword in his right hand.\n\nThen it seemed that a voice spoke within him, chill and bleak and awful, and as if uttered inwardly by the statue itself. And the voice said: \"I am Thasaidon, lord of the seven hells beneath the earth, and the hells of man's heart above the earth, which are seven times seven. For the moment, O Zotulla, my power is become thine for the sake of a mutual vengeance. Be one in all ways with the statue that has my likeness, even as the soul is one with the flesh. Behold! there is a mace of adamant in thy right hand. Lift up the mace, and smite.\"\n\nZotulla was aware of a great power within him, and giant thews about him that thrilled with the power and responded agilely to his will. He felt in his mailed right hand the haft of the huge spiky-headed mace; and though the mace was beyond the lifting of any man in mortal flesh, it seemed no more than a goodly weight to Zotulla. Then, rearing he mace like a warrior in battle, he struck down with one crashing blow the impious thing that wore his own rightful flesh united with the legs and hooves of a demon courser. And the thing crumpled swiftly down and lay with the brain spreading pulpily from its shattered skull on the shining jet. And the legs twitched a little and then grew still; and the hooves glowed from a fiery, blinding white to the redness of red-hot iron, cooling slowly.\n\nFor a space there was no sound, other than the shrill screaming of the girl Obexah, mad with pain and the terror of those prodigies which she had beheld. Then in the soul of Zotulla, grown sick with that screaming, the chill, awful voice of Thasaidon spoke again:\n\n\"Go free, for there is nothing more for thee to do.\" So the spirit of Zotulla passed from the image of Thasaidon and found in the wide air the freedom of nothingness and oblivion.\n\nBut the end was not yet for Namirrha, whose mad, arrogant soul had been loosened from Zotulla's body by the blow, and had returned darkly, not in the manner planned by the magician, to its own body lying in the room of accursed rites and forbidden transmigrations. There Namirrha woke anon, with a dire confusion in his mind, and a partial forgetfulness: for the curse of Thasaidon was upon him now because of his blasphemies.\n\nNothing was clear in his thought except a malign, exorbitant longing for revenge; but the reason thereof, and the object, were as doubtful shadows. And still prompted by that obscure animus, he arose; and girding to his side an enchanted sword with runic sapphires and opals in the hilt, he descended the stairs and came again to the altar of Thasaidon, where the mailed statue stood as impassive as before, with the poised mace in its immovable right hand, and below it, on the altar, the double sacrifice.\n\nA veil of weird darkness was upon the senses of Namirrha, and he saw not the stallion-legged horror that lay dead with slowly blackening hooves; and he heard not the moaning of the girl Obexah, who still lived beside it. But his eyes were drawn by the diamond mirror that was upheld in the claws of black iron basilisks beyond the altar; and going to the mirror, he saw therein a face that he knew no longer for his own. And because his eyes were shadowed and his brain filled with the shifting webs of delusion, he took the face for that of the emperor Zotulla. Insatiable as Hell's own flame, his old hatred rose within him; and he drew the enchanted sword and began to hew therewith at the reflection. Sometimes, because of the curse laid upon him, and the impious transmigration which he had performed, he thought himself Zotulla warring with the necromancer; and again, in the shiftings of his madness, he was Namirrha smiting at the emperor; and then, without name, he fought a nameless foe. And soon the sorcerous blade, though tempered with formidable spells, was broken close to the hilt, and Namirrha beheld the image still unharmed. Then, howling aloud the half-forgotten runes of a most tremendous curse, made invalid through his own forgettings, he hammered still with the heavy sword-hilt on the mirror, till the runic sapphires and opals cracked in the hilt and fell away at his feet in little fragments.\n\nObexah, dying on the altar, saw Namirrha battling with his image, and the spectacle moved her to mad laughter like the pealing of bells of ruined crystal. And above her laughter, and above the cursings of Namirrha, there came anon like the rumbling of a swift-driven storm the thunder made by the macrocosmic stallions of Thamogorgos, returning gulfward through Xylac over Ummaos, to trample down the one house that they had spared aforetime.",

\n\n在佐西克——地球最后的陆地上，太阳不再如鼎盛时期般炽白耀眼，而是蒙着一层血雾般的晦暗锈色。无数陌生的星辰在天空中显现，无限的阴影愈发逼近大地。自阴影中，远古诸神重归人间：那些自希柏里尔、穆大陆与波塞多尼斯时代便被遗忘的神明，虽换了名号，本质却一如往昔。古老的恶魔亦随之归来，啜饮邪恶祭品的烟气，再度滋养原始巫术。  \n\n佐西克的死灵法师与术士多如牛毛，其恶行与奇术在末世广为流传。但在所有施法者中，无人能及纳米尔哈——他先是将黑色枷锁强加于赛拉克诸城，而后在狂傲的谵妄中，竟自诩为邪神萨赛顿的真正匹敌者。  \n\n纳米尔哈将居所建在赛拉克都城乌玛奥斯。他来自塔苏恩荒漠，身后如沙漠风暴般翻腾着骇人巫术的恶名。无人知晓他实为乌玛奥斯的弃儿；众人都以为他出身塔苏恩。确实，谁能想到这位大术士竟是乞丐少年纳索斯的化身？这个身世可疑的孤儿，当年日日徘徊在乌玛奥斯的街巷与集市乞食。他活得卑如蝼蚁，孤独遭唾；对这座残酷浮华之城的憎恨，犹如闷燃的暗火在他心中滋长，静待焚尽万物的时机。  \n\n纳索斯的怨毒随年岁愈加深重。某日，比他略年长的祖图拉王子骑着一匹烈马，在皇宫前的广场与他相遇。纳索斯匍匐乞讨，祖图拉却嗤之以鼻，策马扬蹄将他践踏于铁蹄之下。垂死的纳索斯昏迷许久，路人视若无睹。苏醒后，他拖着残躯爬回破屋，从此终生跛行，蹄印如烙印般永不消退。后来他离开乌玛奥斯，很快被世人遗忘。南行至塔苏恩荒漠时，他迷失方向濒临绝境，最终抵达一处绿洲，遇见隐士巫师奥法洛克——此人宁可与豺狼为伴也不近人性。奥法洛克看出这饥饿少年天赋异禀且心怀邪念，便收留了他。纳索斯随巫师修习多年，继承其从恶魔手中夺取的秘术。在那隐修所，他食用非尘世水土孕育的果实与美酒，研习诡谲知识。如奥法洛克一般，他成为魔道宗师，与魔王萨赛顿立下契约。奥法洛克死后，他更名纳米尔哈，以强大术士之姿游走于塔苏恩的游牧部落与深葬木乃伊之间。但乌玛奥斯的童年苦难与祖图拉的凌辱始终噬咬其心，年复一年，他在脑海中编织着复仇的黑网。他的恶名远播塔苏恩之外，约罗斯诸城与食尸鬼之神莫迪吉安栖居的祖尔-巴-夏尔皆闻风丧胆。早在纳米尔哈亲临前，乌玛奥斯人已视其为比热风瘟疫更可怖的传说灾星。  \n\n纳索斯离城数年后，祖图拉之父皮塞姆被秋夜钻入御榻取暖的小蝰蛇咬死。有传言说毒蛇乃祖图拉所遣，但无人能证实。皮塞姆死后，独子祖图拉继位为赛拉克皇帝，在乌玛奥斯施行暴政。他怠惰残暴，沉溺诡奇奢靡，而同样腐化的臣民却颂扬其恶行。因此他愈发肆无忌惮，天地魔君皆未降罚。血日灰月一次次西沉于赛拉克，坠入罕有舟楫的远海——据水手所言，那片海流经恶名昭彰的纳特岛后，会化作奔涌瀑布从地球边缘泻入虚空。  \n\n祖图拉的罪孽如悬于深渊之上的肿胀果实日益糜烂。但时光之风轻柔，果实迟迟未落。他在弄臣、阉人与情妇间纵声大笑，其荒淫事迹与纳米尔哈的邪术并称双奇。  \n\n豺狼之年，天狼星月，祖图拉为乌玛奥斯居民设下盛宴。东方索塔尔岛的异域香料烹制的肉食堆积如山，约罗斯与赛拉克的烈酒如地火般从巨瓮中倾泻不绝。酒液催发狂笑与王侯般的疯癫，继而带来堪比冥河的长眠。饮者接连倒卧于街巷宅院，恍遭瘟疫侵袭；祖图拉则在黑檀木与黄金打造的宴厅中，伴着妃嫔与侍从酣睡。因此当天狼星西斜时，整座乌玛奥斯无人清醒。  \n\n无人目睹纳米尔哈的降临。直至次日近午，醉意未消的祖图拉被提前醒来的阉奴与女眷的惊惶私语吵醒。询问缘由时，他得知夜间发生异象，但宿醉朦胧中难辨究竟，直到宠妃奥贝莎引他至宫殿东廊亲见奇观。  \n\n皇宫独踞乌玛奥斯中心，北西南三面延伸着广袤的御花园，拱形棕榈与喷泉林立。而东面开阔空地上，竟在一夜之间拔地而起一座巍峨建筑——石质穹顶如巨菇丛生，苍白大理石圆顶与皇宫等高，黑缟玛瑙与龙血斑岩镶嵌的巨墙上，多柱门廊与深凹阳台交错层叠。祖图拉以淫秽誓言咒骂赛拉克诸魔，惊骇于这巫术杰作。女眷们簇拥着他发出刺耳尖叫；醒来的廷臣们加剧了骚动；裹着金缕衣的肥胖阉人如金盆中的黑胶冻般颤抖。但祖图拉强作镇定道：  \n\n\"这趁夜潜入乌玛奥斯的豺狼，竟敢在朕的皇宫对面筑此渎神之巢？去查明这恶徒之名——但先让刽子手磨利双刃剑。\"  \n\n畏惧皇帝震怒的侍从们战栗着接近那座诡宅。门廊看似空荡，直到他们走近时，一具高逾常人的巨骸突然显现。它腰缠红绸，头戴钻石黑巾，眼窝跃动着沼泽鬼火，齿间垂着腐黑的舌头，白骨在阳光下森然反光。  \n\n侍从们僵立无声，唯有金带咯吱与绸衣簌簌作响。骸骨足骨叩击黑玛瑙地面，腐舌震颤着吐出油腻腻的话语：  \n\n\"回去告诉祖图拉皇帝：先知术士纳米尔哈已来与他比邻而居。\"  \n\n听见骸骨如活人般言语，听闻纳米尔哈这如丧钟般的名字，侍从们仓皇逃回禀报。  \n\n得知来者身份后，祖图拉的怒火如遭黑暗之风般骤然熄灭。他面颊酒色褪为惨白，嘴唇无声蠕动着似在祈祷或诅咒。纳米尔哈降临的消息如夜枭掠过全城，留下永不消散的恐惧。因纳米尔哈的邪术与可怖仆从，他已成为世俗君主不敢忤逆的存在，世人畏之如惧地狱与外域的幽暗主宰。乌玛奥斯人传说他乘沙漠风携仆从而至，借魔鬼之力一夜筑宅。他们说宅基筑于地狱金刚岩顶，地窖深处可见冥火或底层夜空的星辰。纳米尔哈的仆从包括异邦亡者、天地深渊的恶魔，以及他通过禁忌杂交创造的疯癫造物。  \n\n人们避行宅邸周边，皇宫中少有人敢眺望其方向的露台。祖图拉绝口不提纳米尔哈，佯装无视这位入侵者；后宫则流传着术士与其女眷的邪恶闲言。虽然城中无人亲眼见过纳米尔哈——有人认为他常隐形出行——但他的存在无处不在：门廊内不时传出受诅者的嚎叫，时而爆发出如金属神像般的大笑，时而响起似冰狱碎冰的窃笑。无光无烛时，柱廊间有幽影游移；黄昏窗口闪烁如魔瞳的红光。随着赭色太阳一次次西沉于赛拉克远海，灰月夜夜坠向隐秘深渊，人们见术士未施显恶，渐渐放下戒心。祖图拉重拾酒盏，继续奢宴；黑暗的萨赛顿仍是赛拉克无名的真正主宰。乌玛奥斯人甚至开始夸耀纳米尔哈的恐怖巫术，如同昔日炫耀祖图拉的紫袍之罪。  \n\n但纳米尔哈始终蛰伏在魔鬼所筑宅邸深处，反复编织复仇黑网。而祖图拉对纳索斯的凌辱，不过是皇帝早已遗忘的诸多暴行中最轻的一桩。  \n\n当祖图拉稍释戒心，后宫闲谈渐稀之时，新的恐怖降临。某夜宴饮中，皇帝与群臣听见御花园传来万马奔腾之声。醉意朦胧的廷臣们惊惶四顾，祖图拉怒遣卫兵查探。卫兵只见月光下的草坪被无形铁蹄践踏，棕榈叶无风自动，珍稀花卉接连倒伏。恐惧攫住卫兵，他们退回宫中禀报。祖图拉亲临阳台目睹异象，耳闻幽灵马群的喧嚣，眼见精心培育的花圃遭毁，心中交织着愤怒与恐惧。女眷、廷臣与阉奴瑟缩其后，全宫无人成眠。直至破晓，蹄声才向着纳米尔哈的宅邸渐行渐远。\n\n当旭日在乌玛奥斯上空完全升起时，皇帝在侍卫簇拥下走出宫殿。他看见被践踏的草丛与折断的花茎焦黑如焚，仿佛地狱马蹄所经之处皆遭火燎。那些清晰可辨的印记如同万千铁骑踏过所有草坪与花坛，却在花园边缘戛然而止。尽管众人都认为这是纳米尔哈降下的灾厄，但在巫师居所前的庭院里却找不到任何证据——此处的草皮完好无损。\n\n\"若真是纳米尔哈所为，愿瘟疫降临这恶徒！\"佐图拉厉声喝道，\"朕何曾亏待过他？朕定要将这野狗的脖颈踩在脚下，让刑轮如同地狱战马践踏朕的索塔尔血红百合、纳亚特脉纹鸢尾和乌卡斯特罗紫兰般折磨他。纵使他身为撒旦总督、万魔之主，朕的赤红刑轮也必将他碾作焦黑枯骨！\"皇帝虽如此咆哮，却未下达任何报复命令，也无人敢踏出宫门前往巫师宅邸。而那座诡谲府邸始终门户紧闭，不见人影亦不闻人声。\n\n白昼流逝，夜幕降临，天边新月蒙着晦暗光晕。万籁俱寂中，佐图拉在宴席间频频怒饮，不断咒骂着新的威胁。随着夜色渐深，灾厄似乎不会重演。然而午夜时分，沉醉葡萄酒酣眠的皇帝被奥贝克萨摇醒——石砌宫廊与露台上正回荡着恶魔般的马蹄轰鸣。整夜里，可怖蹄声在穹顶间反复激荡，皇帝与宠妃蜷缩在锦缎被褥间颤抖，全宫上下无人敢踏出寝殿半步。黎明前夕，蹄声骤然消失，次日人们发现门廊与阳台的大理石地砖上布满无数焦黑蹄印，宛如烙铁所留。\n\n目睹斑驳地面的皇帝面如死灰，恐惧从此如影随形。宫女们窃窃私语想要逃离乌玛奥斯，连白昼的宴乐都仿佛笼罩在阴影之下。及至午夜，屋顶与走廊再度响起马蹄奔腾之声，直至破晓时分，穹顶仍回荡着空洞蹄音，恍若神驹踏过天界。\n\n当恐怖蹄声在寝宫外徘徊时，佐图拉与奥贝克萨再无寻欢作乐之心。拂晓前，青铜巨门外传来烈马扬蹄般的撞击声，随后万籁归于死寂。天亮后，人们发现厅堂镶嵌画遭毁，金银地毯被灼出黑洞，雪白穹顶布满麻点般的焦痕，皇帝寝宫的青铜门上赫然烙着两只深陷的前蹄印。\n\n乌玛奥斯乃至整个希拉克都流传着这个凶兆，有人认为这是纳米尔哈对皇权的示威，也有人归因于东方新崛起的巫师。希拉克众神庙祭司则宣称这是诸神索要更多祭品的征兆。\n\n在玛瑙碧玉地砖遍布蹄印的觐见厅里，佐图拉召集祭司与占卜师寻求破解之法。意见分歧之下，皇帝只得备齐各教派祭品，同时强令术士们前往巫师府邸探明真相。这些畏缩的访客被迫在刀剑威逼下走向那座魔鬼建造的宅院。\n\n日落前，面如死灰的使者们带回了纳米尔哈的口信：\"告知佐图拉，此乃宿命对他遗忘之事的警示。明日午后，纳米尔哈邀皇帝与全体廷臣赴宴。\"尽管皇帝再三追问，无人愿详述在巫师宅邸的见闻，最终这些术士趁夜逃离了希拉克永不复返。\n\n此刻纳米尔哈正独坐厅堂，黑曜石祭坛上矗立着古代邪王供奉的撒旦巨像。七盏银灯以马颅为形，眼窝喷吐变幻的妖火，为恶魔铠甲投下诡谲阴影。巫师紧蹙眉头凝视神像——他刚被撒旦拒绝了复仇请求。\n\n\"我曾屡次应你所求，\"石像发出金属般的轰鸣，\"但此次不会助你报复佐图拉。因缘玄妙，若非当年马蹄践踏，乞丐纳索斯永无可能成为伟大的纳米尔哈。\" \n\n\"这份恩情我明日必报，\"巫师狰狞低吼，\"纵使你拒绝，亦有他者应我所召。\"\n\n\"挑衅我与召唤未知俱非明智，\"神像最终道，\"但既然你执意如此，便自行承担后果罢。\"\n\n午夜时分，巫师登上螺旋阶梯来到星象穹顶。通过逆转空间的秘法，他俯身悬窗外，向非人存在吟诵太古咒语。当那些超越地狱与元素的可怖实体俯身应答时，他的黑须因它们冰冷的吐息而凝结白霜。\n\n宿醉醒来的佐图拉想起那道不敢接受又不敢拒绝的邀请，连晨光都显得污浊。\"这巫师走狗算什么东西？\"他对奥贝克萨抱怨道，\"朕岂能如街头乞丐般任他差遣？\"\n\n这位来自拷问者之岛乌卡斯特罗的金肤斜眸女子意味深长地注视着皇帝...\n\n\"噢，佐图拉，接受或拒绝全凭您圣意裁夺。诚然，对乌玛奥斯与全境西拉克之主而言，去留不过微末小事，毕竟无人能质疑他的至高权威。既然如此，何不欣然前往？\"奥贝克萨虽对这巫师心怀畏惧，却对那座恶魔所筑、鲜为人知的宅邸充满好奇；更如天下女子般，渴望一睹传奇中的纳米尔哈真容——在乌玛奥斯，他的风仪相貌至今仍是遥不可及的传说。\n\n\"此言不无道理。\"佐图拉沉吟道，\"然帝王行事须以社稷为重，此中牵涉国政机要，非妇人所能参透。\"\n\n及至晌午，用罢丰盛酒宴后，他召集群臣商议。有人劝他漠视纳米尔哈之邀，另一些人则主张赴约，以免王城遭受比幽灵铁蹄更可怖的灾祸。\n\n佐图拉又召集众祭司，试图召回那些趁夜潜逃的巫师与占卜师。后者竟无一人响应召唤，此事颇令人惊诧。而祭司们却较往日更踊跃，将觐见厅挤得水泄不通——前排者肚腹紧贴御阶，末排者脊背压扁在廊柱之上。当帝王征询意见时，祭司们坚称纳米尔哈与神谕无关，此邀约绝无恶意。从信函措辞来看，巫师分明是要向佐图拉传达神谕；若纳米尔哈确系至尊法师，这神谕必将印证祭司们的智慧，重彰天启本源，令西拉克诸神再现荣光。\n\n听罢祭司谏言，帝王命司库厚赐众人。待这群神仆拖着满身供奉、用油滑腔调为皇室祈福告退后，日影已斜坠乌玛奥斯天际，将无垠沙海镀成血泊。佐图拉仍举棋不定，遂唤侍酒官呈上最烈性的陈酿，却终未在杯中找到决断。\n\n午后三刻，王宫大门外骤起骚动。男人低沉的哀嚎与宦官妇人尖利的惊叫交织成恐怖浪潮，席卷每处厅堂。佐图拉正欲遣人查探，忽见一列身着紫红寿衣、头戴金冠的高大木乃伊鱼贯入殿。其后跟着巨型骷髅侍从——腰缠橘红缠腰布，颅骨上盘绕着黄黑相间的活蛇充作头饰。木乃伊们以干枯嗓音宣告：\n\n\"吾等乃塔苏恩古国列王，奉纳米尔哈之命为佐图拉陛下护驾，以配得上他赴宴的威仪。\"\n\n骷髅们牙齿咔嗒作响，如同气流穿过镂空象牙屏风般嘶声道：\n\n\"吾等乃被遗忘的巨人族战士，亦受纳米尔哈差遣，护卫随行皇室成员平安赴宴。\"\n\n侍酒官们吓得蜷缩在御座周围，佐图拉却僵坐如冰，眼白充血，面如死灰。此时木乃伊胸襟突然裂开，沥青色的啮齿怪物——眼睛如受诅咒的红宝石——从它们被啃噬的心脏中探出头来，用刺耳人声复述着邀约。骷髅们齐声应和，颅顶蛇群嘶嘶作响，某些蜷缩在肋骨牢笼里的毛茸怪物也发出不祥低鸣。\n\n帝王如梦游者般起身前行。骷髅们抽出银制古笛，奏起甜美而邪恶的死亡曲调。魔音所至，宫女侍卫、庖厨杂役皆如夜游魂般从藏身处爬出，加入这支诡异仪仗。斜阳下，活人与死王组成的队伍向巫师宅邸进发，唯有奥贝克萨紧贴佐图拉身侧，眼中满是惊惶。\n\n纳米尔哈的宅门前蹲伏着龙首人身的猩红怪物，它们垂下血瀑般的肉冠叩拜帝王。穿过这些守卫后，众人踏入柱林密布的巨厅。千盏邪灯的光芒吞噬了天光，厅堂纵深竟似超越建筑本身尺度——无数筵席沿着无顶柱廊延伸至星光泯灭的黑暗深处。\n\n纳米尔哈的仆役穿行席间，构成噩梦般的图景：眼窝蠕动着蛆虫的华服尸王用独角兽角杯斟满血酒；三尾四乳的拉弥亚以青铜爪高举烟腾餐盘；吐着火焰舌信的犬首恶魔争相引路。为佐图拉二人领路的怪物更奇——下半身是丰腴黑妇，上半身却是巨猿白骨。\n\n当队伍抵达主宴席时，佐图拉恍如堕入地狱魔窟。纳米尔哈独坐黑檀长桌尽头，七盏马颅灯在他身后投跃动幽焰，右侧玄曜石祭坛上矗立着黑甲神像萨顿，一旁铁棘尾蜥爪托举的钻石镜泛着冷光。\n\n巫师起身相迎时，佐图拉感到心脏血液几近凝固。他凹陷眼窝中双眸如寒星冰冷，薄唇似封印厄运的朱砂，黑檀油膏固定的胡须如僵直蛇群垂落猩红法袍。奥贝克萨偷瞥这位被恐怖光环加冕如君王的存在，既惧且惑——她竟在这般情境下揣测起巫师的闺帷秘事。\n\n\"欢迎莅临寒舍，佐图拉陛下。\"纳米尔哈的声音如丧钟在铁棺中回荡，\"请入席。\"\n\n乌木御椅已为帝王备好，奥贝克萨的座位则稍逊威仪。当二人落座时，整座大厅的宾客亦纷纷就位，可怖仆从如地狱使者般穿梭侍宴。\n\n佐塔拉蓦然惊觉，一只尸骸般的幽暗之手正往水晶杯里为他斟酒。那枯手上戴着西拉克历代帝王的玺戒——黄金蝙蝠口中衔着妖异火欧珀的戒指，与他食指上终日佩戴的款式如出一辙。他战栗回首，竟见右手边伫立着亡父皮萨姆的形貌：蝰蛇毒液流窜四肢后留下的紫黑尸斑仍清晰可见。正是佐塔拉亲手将毒蛇放入父亲寝榻，此刻他在席间蜷缩颤抖，负罪的恐惧啃噬着心脏。那酷似皮萨姆的存在——不知是复生的尸骸还是纳米尔哈邪术塑造的幻象——始终徘徊在帝王肘侧，用僵直乌黑的肿胀手指精准侍奉。更可怖的是那对鼓胀无神的眼珠，青紫嘴唇凝固着死亡的静默，每当它俯身添酒布菜时，花纹蝰蛇便从厚重袖褶间探出冰冷眼瞳。恐惧的冰雾中，皇帝恍惚看见披甲幽影——如同纳米尔哈渎神铸造的萨赛顿雕像复生——正为巫师履行同样的侍奉之职。而奥贝克萨身旁飘荡的剥皮无眼尸骸，则幻化成她初恋情人的模样：那个遭遇海难流落拷问者之岛的辛特罗姆少年。当年潮水将他推上沙滩，奥贝克萨将他藏匿岩洞取乐，最终却交给拷问者们处置，在种种酷刑中获取新鲜快感。\n\n\"请饮。\"纳米尔哈啜饮着如灾厄夕照般暗红的诡酒。帝后饮下后只觉寒如毒芹，凉意缓缓渗向心脏。\n\n\"此酒甚佳，\"巫师道，\"正适合庆贺我们的相识：它曾随皇族葬于碧玉瓮中，是我的食尸鬼在塔苏恩掘墓所得。\"\n\n佐塔拉的舌头如曼德拉草冻在冰封土壤里，对这番礼节全然无法回应。\n\n\"请尝尝这道珍馐，\"纳米尔哈继续道，\"此乃乌卡斯特罗拷问者用刑具残渣喂养的野猪，佐以墓穴香膏、蝰蛇心脏与黑眼镜蛇之舌。\"\n\n皇帝哑然无言，连奥贝克萨也因剥皮亡灵的现身而沉默。巫师知晓这段湮灭罪孽并召唤幻影的能力，令她感到比任何邪术都更骇人。\n\n\"想必二位觉得宴席乏味，\"纳米尔哈道，\"不如召来乐师助兴。\"\n\n他念出晦涩咒语，厅内顿时响起层层叠叠的回声。先登场的是雌性食尸鬼歌者，剃光的躯体与多毛小腿形成可怖对比，獠牙间垂落腐肉残渣。乐师们更是诡异：有些是直立黑马后腿行走的雄性魔鬼，用白猿手指拨弄人骨竖琴；另一些则是吹奏人皮双簧管的杂色羊头萨提尔。\n\n它们向巫师行过荒诞礼仪后，食尸鬼立刻发出嗅到腐肉般的哀嚎，萨提尔奏响的乐曲恍若穿过后宫废墟的荒漠之风。佐塔拉骨髓结冰，音符中似有帝国在时间铁蹄下崩塌的幻象。他不断听见枯园沙响、朽绸窸窣、断柱间蛇信嘶鸣，乌玛奥斯的荣光仿佛随沙漠热风消散。\n\n\"舞者将为诸位献艺。\"纳米尔哈说着在空中划出秘符。灰雾降下又散去时，铅桌已然消失。皇帝的子民们被捆缚在地，骷髅舞者用趾骨敲击节奏在其身上跳跃，木乃伊僵硬鞠躬。随着音乐渐响，舞者身形暴涨如远古巨人，舞步震得厅堂颤动。被践踏者如同秋日酿酒葡萄，地面积满深红汁液。\n\n\"看来诸位更期待压轴好戏。\"纳米尔哈的声音穿透噩梦。帝后如梦游者随他登上高台，但见夕阳将天空染成血幕。\n\n\"看好了。\"巫师念出令建筑共振的咒语。阳台陡然升空，整座乌玛奥斯城在脚下萎缩。当纳米尔哈喊出十二禁忌真名与\"格纳·帕达姆比斯·德沃姆普拉·桑吉斯·弗里多尔·阿沃拉格蒙\"的骇人咒文时，地平线腾起形似天马的漆黑巨云。它们踏碎落日，以泰坦竞技场般的威势奔袭而来。佐塔拉这才惊觉那并非乌云，而是实体化的洪荒巨兽。它们投下的阴影覆盖数里，铁蹄将远方绿洲城镇碾作齑粉。\n\n他们如一座座尖塔般的风暴席卷而来，整个世界仿佛向着深渊收缩，在那可怖重压下倾斜。佐图拉如被石化般僵立，眼睁睁看着自己的帝国走向毁灭。那些巨马以难以想象的速度逼近，蹄声如雷，将乌玛奥斯城西延绵数英里的翠绿田野与累累果园尽数践踏。阴影如邪恶的日蚀般攀升，直至笼罩整座城池。皇帝抬头望去，但见那些马眼高悬天地之间，犹如自翻腾云层中俯视人间的凶星。\n\n在愈发浓重的黑暗中，在那令人窒息的雷鸣之上，他听见纳米尔哈疯狂而胜利的呼喊：\n\n\"听着，佐图拉，我召唤了深渊之主塔莫格戈斯的战马。这些战马将踏平你的帝国，正如当年你的坐骑践踏那个名叫纳索斯的乞儿。更要明白——我纳米尔哈，就是那个男孩。\"术士眼中燃烧着癫狂与怨毒，犹如灾星升至天顶时迸发的恶光。\n\n对深陷恐惧与喧嚣的佐图拉而言，死灵法师的宣言不过是末日风暴中的尖锐嘶鸣。当坚不可摧的屋顶被撕裂，宏伟石砌建筑瞬间分崩离析时，巨马蹄已降临乌玛奥斯。华美庙宇如鲍壳般粉碎，骄傲宅邸似葫芦被碾入尘土。整座城市在震耳欲聋的崩塌声中逐间倾覆，宛若世界重归混沌。昏暗街道上，人群与骆驼如蝼蚁奔逃却难逃厄运。无情的铁蹄起落间，半城已成废墟，永夜笼罩天地。佐图拉的宫殿轰然倒塌，此刻巨马前肢已与纳米尔哈的露台齐平，可怖头颅高悬上方。就在它们即将踏碎术士居所之际，马群突然左右分开。伴着西方残阳的惨淡微光，铁蹄继续向东碾过乌玛奥斯剩余城区。佐图拉、奥贝莎与纳米尔哈俯视着满城碎片，如同凝视遍布陶片的垃圾场，耳中回荡着铁蹄向东喀拉克渐远的灭世轰鸣。\n\n\"真是赏心悦目。\"纳米尔哈说道，随即阴毒地转向皇帝：\"但别以为就此结束——你的末日尚未圆满。\"\n\n露台似乎已恢复原先高度，仍俯瞰着瓦砾遍地的废墟。纳米尔哈拽着皇帝手臂将其拖入内室，奥贝莎默默跟随。接连灾祸如噩梦魇魔压得皇帝心如死灰。他未曾察觉奥贝莎已被纳米尔哈那些裹着腐尸布的阴影仆从挟持下楼，呜咽声尽数闷在那些秽浊裹尸布中。\n\n这间施行亵渎仪式的密室里，灯焰泛着恶魔血般的橘红。那些难以名状的蒸馏器、坩埚与黑炉上，正熬煮着星光般冰冷的幽暗液体。当液体沸腾升起螺旋状蒸汽时，纳米尔哈将其注入金边铁杯，以不容违逆的口吻命令佐图拉饮下。皇帝疑为毒药而迟疑，术士饮尽己杯后投来致命凝视。佐图拉如奉死神之命般啜饮，意识随即陷入黑暗。彻底沉沦前，他瞥见纳米尔哈也已空杯。\n\n难以言喻的痛苦中，皇帝感到自己已然死亡。灵魂飘荡间，他以无形之眼看见两具躯壳——自己的与纳米尔哈的——静静倒卧在猩红灯光里。突然，他的躯壳竟自行站起，眼中燃烧着比往日更深的邪火。那具身体发出纳米尔哈特有的傲慢嗓音：\"无家可归的幽魂，且随我来。\"\n\n佐图拉的灵体如无形阴影般跟随术士下楼，来到宴会大厅。撒旦祭坛前，他挚爱的奥贝莎正被绑在神像脚下。纳米尔哈操纵皇帝身躯在黑暗神像前停驻，命其灵魂永囚于这具铠甲雕像中。佐图拉顿觉自己被封入冰冷巨铠，如困石棺般透过盔缝僵视外界。\n\n他惊骇地发现——自己原本的身躯在纳米尔哈附体下，腰部以下已化为黑马后肢，蹄铁泛着地狱熔炉般的红光。当这怪物傲慢地走向祭坛上的奥贝莎时，蹄印在石板上烙出青烟。它抬起灼红铁蹄压在少女袒露的胸脯上，镶嵌红宝石的金丝胸衣瞬间凹陷。奥贝莎发出堕入地狱者般的惨叫，而铁蹄亮如刚从恶魔锻炉取出的凶器。\n\n此刻，禁锢在神像中的佐图拉灵魂，终于燃起帝国覆灭时都未曾觉醒的怒火。一个冰冷可怖的声音在他体内响起：\"吾乃撒旦，地下七狱与人心七七四十九狱之主。此刻赐汝力量共行复仇。举起手中战锤！\"\n\n佐图拉感到神力贯注全身，玄铁巨锤在掌中轻若无物。他如战士般抡起战锤，将那个占据自己身躯的马蹄怪物轰然击碎。脑浆在乌黑祭坛上迸溅，恶魔之蹄由白炽渐暗为冷却的烙铁色。抽搐的异形躯壳终于静止，唯有镶宝金丝胸衣仍在余烬中闪着微光。\n\n一时间，四下唯有欧贝克莎那因剧痛与可怖异象而发狂的尖叫声。当这尖叫令佐图拉的灵魂愈发不适时，塔赛冬那冰冷可怖的声音再度响起：\n\n\"去吧，你已无事可做。\"于是佐图拉的魂魄从塔赛冬神像中解脱，在虚无与遗忘的广阔虚空中获得自由。\n\n但纳米尔哈的终结尚未到来——那疯狂傲慢的灵魂因重击脱离了佐图拉的躯体，以并非法师预想的方式，阴森地回归了躺在诅咒仪式与禁忌转生之室的本体。纳米尔哈随即苏醒，神智陷入可怕的混乱与部分失忆：因亵渎之罪，塔赛冬的诅咒已降临其身。\n\n他脑海中唯剩恶毒至极的复仇渴望；但其缘由与目标却如可疑的阴影般模糊。受这晦暗恨意驱使，他起身将一柄镶有符文蓝宝石与蛋白石的魔剑系于腰间，走下阶梯重返塔赛冬祭坛。披甲神像依旧漠然矗立，不动如山的右手中悬着钉头锤，祭坛上摆放着双重祭品。\n\n纳米尔哈的感官笼罩在诡异黑暗的帷幕中，他看不见那具逐渐发黑的马蹄怪物尸体，也听不见仍苟延残喘的欧贝克莎的呻吟。但祭坛后方黑铁鸡蛇兽爪间高举的钻石魔镜吸引了他的目光。当他望向镜面，映入眼帘的是一张不再认识的面容。由于双眼蒙翳、脑中充斥着变幻的妄念之网，他将那张脸认作皇帝佐图拉。地狱烈焰般永不餍足的旧恨在胸中翻涌，他抽出魔剑向倒影劈砍。因诅咒与渎神转生的影响，他时而以为自己是与死灵法师交战的佐图拉，时而又在疯狂变幻中化作攻击皇帝的纳米尔哈；最终，他以无名之躯对抗着无名之敌。很快，尽管蕴含强大咒语，魔剑仍从剑柄处断裂。纳米尔哈发现镜中影像毫发无损，便嘶吼着残缺不全的终极诅咒符文（因记忆缺失已然失效），继续用沉重的剑柄猛击镜面，直至符文蓝宝石与蛋白石迸裂，化作碎片散落脚边。\n\n垂死的欧贝克莎在祭坛上目睹纳米尔哈与倒影搏斗，这景象令她发出水晶残铃般的癫狂笑声。在她的笑声与纳米尔哈的诅咒之上，骤然响起萨摩戈格斯宇宙天马穿越乌玛奥斯、折返深渊时的雷鸣——它们正踏碎那座曾被赦免的孤宅。"

        "title": "The Voyage of King Euvoran",
        "content": "\n\nThe crown of the kings of Ustaim was fashioned only from the rarest materials that could be procured anywhere. The magically graven gold of its circlet had been mined from a huge meteor that fell in the southern isle of Cyntrom, shaking the isle from shore to shore with calamitous earthquake; and the gold was harder and brighter than any native gold of Earth, and was changeable in color from a flamelike red to the yellow of young moons. It was set with thirteen jewels, every one of which was unique and without fellow even in fable. These jewels were a wonder to behold, starring the circlet with strange unquiet fires and fulgurations terrible as the eyes of the cockatrice. But more wonderful than all else was the stuffed gazolba-bird which formed the superstructure of the crown, gripping the circlet with its steely claws above the wearer's brow, and towering royally with resplendent plumage of green, violet and vermilion. Its beak was the hue of burnished brass, its eyes were like small dark garnets in bezels of silver; and seven lacy, miniated quills arose from its ebon- dappled head, and a white tail fell down in a straightly spreading fan like the beams of some white sun behind the circle. The gazolba-bird was the last of its kind, according to the mariners who had slain it in an almost legendary isle beyond Sotar, far to the east of Zothique. For nine generations it had decked the crown of Ustaim, and the kings looked upon it as the sacred emblem of their fortunes, and a talisman inseparable from their royalty, whose loss would be followed by grave disaster.\n\nEuvoran the son of Karpoom, was the ninth wearer of the crown. Superbly and magnificently he had worn it for two years and ten months, following the death of Karpoom from a surfeit of stuffed eels and jellied salamander's eggs. On all state occasions, levees and daily grantings of public audience and administerings of justice, it had graced the brow of the young king and had conferred upon him a dreadful majesty in the eyes of the beholders. Also, it had served to conceal the lamentable increase of an early baldness.\n\nIt came to pass, in the late autumn of the third year of his reign, that King Euvoran rose from a goodly breakfast of twelve courses and twelve wines, and went forth as was his custom to the hall of justice, which occupied an entire wing of his palace in the city of Aramoam, looking down in several- colored marble from its palmy hills to the rippled lazuli of the orient ocean.\n\nBeing well fortified by his breakfast, Euvoran felt himself prepared to unravel the most involute skeins of legality and crime, and was likewise ready for the meting of swift punishment to all malefactors. And beside him, at the right arm of his kraken-sculptured throne of ivory, there stood an executioner leaning on a huge mace with a leaden head that was tempered to the hardness of iron. Full often, with this mace, the bones of the more flagitious offenders were broken immediately, or their brains were split in the kings presence on a floor that was strewn with black sand. And beside the left arm of the throne, a professional torturer busied himself continually with the screws and pulleys of certain fearsome instruments of torture, as a warning of their fate to all evil-doers. And not always idle were the turnings of these screws and the tightenings of these pulleys, and not always empty were the metal beds of the machines.\n\nNow, on that morning, the constables of the city brought before King Euvoran only a few petty thieves and suspicious vagrants; and there were no cases of felony such as would have warranted the wielding of the mace or the use of the torture-implements. So the king, who had looked forward to a pleasurable session, was somewhat balked and disappointed; and he questioned with much severity the minor culprits before him, trying to extort from each of them, in turn, an admission of some graver crime than that whereof he was accused. But it seemed that the pilferers were innocent of aught but pilfering; and the vagrants were guilty of naught worse than vagrancy; and Euvoran began to think that the morning would offer scant entertainment. For the bastinado was the heaviest punishment that he could legally impose on such misdemeanants.\n\n\"Away with these mackerel!\" he roared to the officers, and his crown shook with indignation, and the tall gazolba-bird on the crown appeared to nod and bow. \"Away with them, for they pollute my presence. Give each of them a hundred strokes with the hardwood briar on the bare sole of each foot, and forget not the heels. Then drive them forth from Aramoam toward the public refuse-grounds, and prod them with red-hot tridents if they linger in their crawling.\"\n\nThen, ere the officers could obey him, there entered the hall of justice two belated constables, haling between them a peculiar and most unsavory individual with the long-handled, many pointed hooks that were used in Aramoam for the apprehending of malefactors and suspects. And though the hooks were seemingly embedded in his flesh as well as the filthy rags that served him for raiment, the prisoner bounded perpetually aloft in the manner of a goat, and his captors were obliged to follow in these lively and undignified saltations, so that the three presented the appearance of tumblers. With a final volitation in which the officers were drawn through the air like the tails of a kite, the incredible personage came to a pause before Euvoran. The king regarded him in amazement, blinking rapidly, and was not prepossessed by the singular suppleness with which he louted to the very floor, upsetting the scarce-recovered equilibrium of the officers, and causing them to sprawl at full length in the royal presence.\n\n\"Ha! What have we now?\" said the king in an ominous voice.\n\n\"Sire, 'tis another vagabond,\" replied the breathless officers, when they had regained a more respectfully inclined position. \"He would have passed through Aramoam by the main avenue in the fashion that you behold, without stopping, and without even lessening the altitude of his saltations, if we had not arrested him.\"\n\n\"Such behavior is highly suspicious,\" growled Euvoran hopefully. \"Prisoner, declare your name, your nativity and occupation, and the infamous crimes of which, beyond doubt, you are guilty.\"\n\nThe captive, who was cross-eyed, appeared to regard Euvoran, the royal mace-wielder, and the royal torturer and his instruments all in a single glance. He was ill-favored to an extravagant degree, his nose, ears and other features were all possessed of unnatural mobility, and he grimaced perpetually in a manner that caused his unclean beard to toss and curl like seaweed on a boiling whirlpool.\n\n\"I have many names,\" he replied, in an insolent voice whose pitch was peculiarly disagreeable to Euvoran, setting his teeth on edge like the grating of metal on glass. \"As for my nativity and occupation, the knowledge of these, O king, would profit you little.\"\n\n\"Sirrah, you are malapert. Give answer or tongues of red-hot iron shall question you,\" roared Euvoran.\n\n\"Be it known to you, then, that I am a necromancer, and was born in the realm where the dawn and the sunset come together and the moon is equal in brightness to the sun.\"\n\n\"Ha! A necromancer!\" snorted the king. \"Know you not that necromancy is a capital crime in Ustaim? Verily, we shall find means to dissuade you from the practice of such infamies.\"\n\nAt a sign from Euvoran, the officers drew their captive toward the instruments of torture. Much to their surprise, in view of his former ebullience, he allowed himself to be chained supinely on the iron bed that produced a remarkable elongation of the limbs of its occupants. The official engineer of these miracles began to work the levers, and the bed lengthened little by little with a surly grating, till it seemed that the prisoner's joints would be torn apart. Inch by inch was added to his stature; and though, after a time, he had gained more than a half-cubit from the stretching, he appeared to experience no discomfort whatever; and to the stupefaction of all present, it became plain that the elasticity of his arms, legs and body was beyond the extensibility of the rack itself; for the latter was now drawn to its limits.\n\nAll were silent, viewing this prodigy; and Euvoran rose from his seat and went over to the rack, as if doubtful of his own eyes that testified to a thing so enormous. And the prisoner said to him:\n\n\"It were well to release me, O King Euvoran.\"\n\n\"Say you so?\" the king cried out in a rage. \"However, it is not thus that we deal with felons in Ustaim.\" And he made a private sign to the executioner, who came forward quickly, rearing his massive, leaden-headed mace aloft.\n\n\"On your own head be it,\" said the necromancer, and he rose instantly from the iron bed, breaking the bonds that held him, as if they had been chains of grass. Then, towering to a terrible height, which the wrenchings of the rack had given him, he pointed his long forefinger, dark and sere as that of a mummy, at the king's crown; and simultaneously he uttered a foreign word that was shrill and eldritch as the crying of migrant fowl that pass over toward unknown shores in the night. And lo! As if in answer to that word, there was a loud, sudden flapping of wings above Euvoran's head and the king felt that his brow was lightened by the crown's goodly and well-accustomed weight. A shadow fell upon him, and he, and all who were present, beheld above them in the air the stuffed gazolba-bird, which had been slain more than two hundred years before by sea-faring men in a remote isle. The wings of the bird, a living splendor, were outspread as if for flight, and it carried still in its steely claws the rare circlet of the crown. Librating, it hung for a little over the throne, while the king watched it in wordless awe and consternation. Then, with metallic whirring, its white tail deployed like the beams of a flying sun, it flew swiftly through the open portals, and passed seaward from Aramoam into the morning light.\n\nAfter it, with great bounds and goatish leapings, the necromancer followed; and no man tried to deter him. But those who saw him depart from the city swore that he went north along the ocean-strand, while the bird flew directly eastward, as if homing to the half-fabulous isle of its nativity. Thereafter, as if he had gone at a single bound into alien realms, the necromancer was not seen in Ustaim. But the crew of a merchant galley from Sotar, landing later in Aramoam, told how the gazolba-bird had passed over them in mid-main, a several-colored glory still flying toward the sources of the dayspring. And they said that the crown of changeable gold, with its thirteen fellowless gems, was still carried by the bird. And though they had trafficked long in the archipelagoes of wonder, and had seen many prodigies, they deemed this thing a most rare and unexampled portent.\n\nKing Euvoran, so strangely reft of that avian head-gear, with his baldness rudely bared to the gaze of thieves and vagrants in the hall of justice, was as one on whom the gods have sent down a sudden bolt. If the sun had turned black in heaven, or his palace walls had crumbled about him, his dumbfoundment would hardly have been more excessive. For it seemed to him that his royalty had flown with that crown which was the emblem and the talisman of his fathers. And, moreover, the thing was wholly against nature, and the laws of god and man were annulled thereby: since never before, in all history or fable, had a dead bird taken flight from the kingdom of Ustaim.\n\nIndeed, the loss was a dire calamity, and Euvoran, having donned a voluminous turban of purple samite, held council with the sagest ministers regarding the state dilemma that had thus arisen. The ministers were no less troubled and perplexed than the king: for the bird and the circlet were both irreplaceable. And in the meanwhile, the rumor of this misfortune was borne abroad through Ustaim, and the land became filled with lamentable doubt and confusion, and some of the people began to murmur covertly against Euvoran, saying that no man could be the rightful ruler of that country without the gazolba-crown.\n\nThen, as was the custom of the kings in a time of national exigence, Eurovan repaired to the temple in which dwelt the god Geol, who was a terrestrial god and the chief deity of Aramoam. Alone, with bare head and unshod feet, as was ordained by hierarchal law, he entered the dim adytum where the image of Geol, pot-bellied, and wrought of earth-brown faience, reclined eternally on its back and regarded the motes in a narrow beam of sunlight from the slotted wall. And, falling prone in the dust that had gathered around the idol through ages, the king gave homage to Geol, and implored an oracle to illuminate and guide him in his need. And after an interim, a voice issued from the god's navel, as if a subterrene rumbling had become articulate. And the voice said to King Eurovan:\n\n\"Go forth and seek the gazolba in those isles that lie beneath the orient sun. There, O king, on the far coasts of dawn, thou shalt again behold the living bird which is the symbol and the fortune of thy dynasty; and there, with thine own hand, thou shalt slay the bird.\"\n\nEuvoran was much comforted by this oracle, since the utterances of the god were deemed infallible. And it seemed to him that the oracle implied in plain terms that he should recover the lost crown of Ustaim, which had the reanimated bird for its superstructure. So, returning to the royal palace, he sent for the captains of his proudest argosies of war, which lay then at anchor in the tranquil harbor of Aramoam, and ordered them to make immediate provision for a long voyage into the east and among the archipelagoes of morning.\n\nWhen all was made ready, King Euvoran went aboard the flagship of the fleet, which was a towering quadrireme with oars of beef-wood and sails of stout woven byssus dyed in yellowish scarlet, and a long gonfalon at the mast head, bearing the gazolba bird in its natural colors on a field of heavenly cobalt. The rowers and sailors of the quadrireme were mighty Negroes from the north; and the soldiers who manned it were fierce mercenaries from Xylac in the west; and with him, going aboard, the king took certain of his concubines and jesters and other ministrants, as well as an ample store of liquors and rare viands, so that he should lack for nothing during the voyage. And mindful of the prophecy of Geol, the king armed himself with a longbow and a quiver filled with parrot-feathered arrows; and he also carried a sling of lion-leather and a blowgun of black bamboo from which tiny poisoned darts were discharged.\n\nIt seemed that the gods favored the voyage; for a wind blew strongly from the west on the morning of the departure; and the fleet, which numbered fifteen vessels, was borne with bellying sails toward the sea-risen sun. And the farewell clamors and shoutings of Euvoran's people on the wharves were soon stilled by distance; and the marble houses of Aramoam on its four palmy hills here drowned in that swiftly foundering bank of azure which was the shoreline of Ustaim. And, thereafter, for many days, the iron-wood beaks of the galleys clove a softly weltering sea of indigo that rose unbroken on all sides to a cloudless, dark-blue heaven.\n\nTrusting in the oracle of Geol, that earthen god who had never failed his fathers, the king made merry as was his wont; and reclining beneath a saffron canopy on the poop of the quadrireme, he swilled from an emerald beaker the wines and brandies that had lain in his palace-vaults, storing the warmth of elder, ardent suns whereon oblivion's black rime was fallen. And he laughed at the ribaldries of his fools, at unquenchable ancient bawdries that had won the laughter of other kings in the sea-lost continents of yore. And his women diverted him with harlotries that were older than Rome or Atlantis. And ever he kept at hand, beside his couch, the weapons wherewith he hoped to hunt and slay again the gazolba-bird, according to the oracle of Geol.\n\nThe winds were unfailing and auspicious, and the fleet sped onward, with the great black oarsmen singing gaily at their oars, and the gorgeous sailcloths flapping loudly, and the long banners floating on the air like straight-blown flames. After a fortnight they came to Sotar, whose low-lying coasts of cassia and sago barred the sea for a hundred leagues from north to south; and in Loithe, the chief port, they paused to inquire for the gazolba-bird. There were rumors that the bird had passed above Sotar; and some of the people said that a cunning sorcerer of that isle, named Iffibos, had drawn it down through his sorcery and had closed it in a cage of sandalwood. So the king landed in Loithe, deeming his quest perhaps already nigh to its end, and went with certain of his captains and soldiers to visit Iffibos, who dwelt in a retired vale among the mountains at the island's core.\n\nIt was a tedious journey, and Euvoran was much annoyed by the huge and vicious gnats of Sotar, which were no respecters of royalty, and were always insinuating themselves under his turban. And when, after some delay and divagation in the deep jungle, he came to the house of Iffibos on a high, precarious crag, he found that the bird was merely one of the bright-plumaged vultures peculiar to the region, which Iffibos had tamed for his own amusement. So the king returned to Loithe, after declining somewhat rudely the invitation of the sorcerer, who wished to show him the unusual feats of falconry to which he had trained the vulture. And in Loithe the king tarried no longer than was needful for the laying aboard of fifty jars of the sovereign arrack in which Sotar excels all other lands.\n\nThen, coasting the southern cliffs and promontories, where the sea bellowed prodigiously in mile-deep caverns, the ships of Euvoran sailed beyond Sotar, and Tosk, whose people were more akin to apes and lemurs than to men. And Euvoran asked the people for news of the gazolba, and received only a chattering as of apes in answer. So the king ordered his men-at-arms to catch a number of these savage islanders and crucify them on the coco-palms for their incivility. And the men-at-arms pursued the nimble people of Tosk for a full day among the trees and boulders in which the isle abounded, but without catching a single one of them. So the king contented himself by crucifying several of the men-at-arms for their failure to obey him and sailed on to the seven atolls of Yumatot, whose inhabitants were mostly cannibals. And beyond Yumatot, which was the usual limit of eastern voyaging from Ustaim, the vessels entered the Ilozian Sea, and began to touch at partly mythic shores and islands charted only in story.\n\nIt were tedious to relate the full particulars of that voyage, in which Euvoran and his captains went ever toward the sources of the dawn. Various and without number were the strange marvels they found in the archipelagoes beyond Yumatot; but nowhere could they find a single feather such as had formed part of the gazolba's plumage; and the quaint people of those isles had never seen the bird.\n\nHowbeit, the king beheld many a flock of unknown, fiery-winged fowl that went over the galleys in mid-sea, passing between the unmarked islets. And, landing often, he practiced his archery on lorikeets and lyrebirds and boobies, or stalked the golden cockatoos with his blowgun. And he chased the dodo and dinornis on shores that were otherwise unpeopled. And once, in a sea of high-beetling barren rocks, the fleet was assailed by mighty griffins that flew down from their crag- built eyries, with wings shining like feathery brass under the meridian sun, and making a harsh clangor as of shields shaken in battle. And the griffins, being both ferocious and pertinacious, were driven away with much difficulty by boulders hurled from the catapults of the vessels.\n\nEverywhere, as the ships drove eastward, there were multitudes of fowl. But at the sunset of a day in the fourth moon following their departure from Aramoam, the vessels approached a nameless isle that towered mile-high with cliffs of black, naked basalt, around whose base the sea cried with baffled anger, and about whose precipices there were no wings nor voices of birds. The isle was topped with gnarly cypresses that might have grown in a windy graveyard; and sullenly it took the afterglow, as if drenched with a gore of darkening blood. Far up in the cliffs there were strange columned eaves like the dwellings of forgotten troglodytes, but seemingly inaccessible to men; and the caves to all appearances were unoccupied by any kind of life, though pitting the face of the isle for leagues. And Euvoran ordered his captains to drop anchor, meaning to search for a landing-place on the morrow: since, in his anxiety to retrieve the gazolba, he would pass no isle of the dawnward main, not even the unlikeliest, without due inquiry and examination.\n\nQuickly fell the darkness, without moon, till the close- anchored ships were visible to each other only by their lanterns. And Euvoran sat at supper in his cabin, sipping the golden arrack of Sotar between mouthfuls of mango-jelly and phenicopter's meat. And, saving a small watch on each of the vessels, the sailors and men-at-arms were all at evening mess; and the rowers ate their figs and lentils in the oar-decks. Then, from the watches, there was a wild shouting of alarm, and the shouting ceased in a moment, and each of the vessels rocked and sagged in the water, as if a monstrous weight had settled upon it. No man knew the thing that had happened, but everywhere there was turmoil and confusion, some saying that the fleet was attacked by pirates. Those who peered from the ports and oar-holes saw that the lanterns of their neighbors had been quenched, and perceived a milling and seething as of low-driven clouds in the darkness, and saw that foul black creatures, large as men and winged like oupires, were clinging to the ranged oars in myriads. And those who dared to approach the open hatches found that the decks, the rigging and the masts were crowded with similar creatures, who, it seemed, were of nocturnal habit and had come down in the manner of bats from their caves in the island.\n\nThen, like things of nightmare, the monsters began to invade the hatches and assail the ports, clawing with hellish talons at the men who opposed them. And, being somewhat hampered by their wings, they were driven back with spears and arrows, but returned again and again in a thickening press without number, cheeping with a faint and bat-like sound. It was plain that they were vampires, for whenever they had dragged a man down, as many of them as could gain mouthhold would fasten on him incontinently, and suck his blood till little more remained than a skinful of bones. The upper oar-decks, being half open to the sky, were quickly usurped, and their crews overcome with a hideous swarming; and the rowers in the orlops cried that the sea-water was pouring in through the oar-holes as the ships sank deeper beneath an ever-gathering weight.\n\nAll night, at the ports and hatches, the men of Euvoran fought the vampires, taking turns in shifts when they wearied. Many of them were seized and their blood sucked before the eyes of their fellows as the night wore on; and the vampires, it seemed, were not to be slain by mortal weapons, though the blood they had gorged came forth in spouting rills from their wounded bodies. And thicklier they clustered upon the fleet, till the biremes began to founder, and the rowers were drowned in the sunken lower decks of certain triremes and quadriremes.\n\nKing Euvoran was wroth at this unseemly turmoil that had interrupted his supper; and when the golden arrack was spilt and the dishes of rare meat were emptied on the floor by the vessel's violent rocking, he would have issued from his cabin, fully armed, to try conclusions with these piacular miscreants. But, even as he turned to fling wide the cabin-door, there was a soft infernal pittering at the port-holes behind him; and the women who were with him began to shriek, and the fools cried out in terror. And the king saw in the lamplight a grisly face with the teeth and nostrils of a flittermouse, that leaned in through one of the cabin-ports. He sought to repel the face, and thereafter, till dawn, he fought the vampires with those very weapons he had designed for the slaying of the gazolba; and the ship's captain, who was with him at supper, guarded a second port with his claymore; and the others were held by two of the king's eunuchs, armed with scimitars. In this warfare they were favored by the smallness of the ports, which could hardly in any case have allowed the free passage of their winged assailants. And, after lightless hours of tedious, horrid struggle, the darkness became thinned with brown twilight, and the vampires lifted from the vessels in a black cloud and returned to their caves in the mile-high cliffs of that unnamed island.\n\nHeavy was the heart of Euvoran within him when he surveyed the damage done to his proud argosies of war: for, among the fifteen vessels, seven had sunk in the night, borne under and swamped by those obscenely clinging hordes of oupires; and the decks of the others were bloody as abbatoirs; and half of the sailors and rowers and men-at-arms were lying flat and flaccid as empty wineskins after the greedy drinking of the great bats. And the sails and banners were shredded into rags; and everywhere, from beak to rudder of Euvoran's galleys, there was the stain and reek of a Stymphalian foulness. So, lest another eve should find them within wing-shot of that accursed isle, the king ordered his remaining captains to weigh anchor; and the other ships, with sea-water still awash in their orlops, and some with drowned rowers still at the oars of their nether banks, drew slowly and heavily to eastward, till the pitted walls of the isle began to sink beneath the main. At eve there was no land in sight anywhere; and after two days, still unharried by the vampires, they came to a coral island, low in the wave, with a calm lagoon that was haunted only by ocean-fowl. And there, for the first time, Euvoran paused to repair his tattered sails, and pump the sea from his holds, and clean the blood and vileness from his decks.\n\nHowever, in spite of this disaster, the king abated not in any degree his purpose, to sail ever on toward the fountains of the day, until, as Geol had predicted, he should come again on the flown gazolba and slay it with his own royal hand. So, for another moon, they passed amid other and stranger archipelagoes, and penetrated deeplier into the regions of myth and story.\n\nBravely they drove into mornings of amaranth crossed by gilded lories, and noontides of darkly ardent sapphire where the rose flamingoes went before them to lost, inviolate strands. The stars changed above them, and under the alien-figured Signs they heard the wild, melancholy crying of swans that flew southward fleeing the winter of realms indiscoverable, and seeking the summer in trackless worlds. And they held speech with fabulous men who wore for mantles the ell-wide pennons of the roc, trailing far on the earth behind them; and men who arrayed themselves in apyornis plumes. And they spoke also with antic people whose bodies were covered with a down like that of a new-hatched fowl, and others whose flesh was studded as if with pin-feathers. But nowhere could they learn aught of the gazolba.\n\nAt mid-forenoon, early in the sixth month of the voyage, a new and unheard-of shore ascended from the deep, curving for many miles, from northeast to southwest, with sheltered harbors, and cliffs and pinnacled crags that were interspaced with low-lying verdurous dales. As the galleys hove toward it, Euvoran and his captains saw that towers were builded on certain of the highmost crags; but in the haven below them there were no ships at anchor nor boats moving; and the shore of the haven was a wilderness of green trees and grass. And, sailing still nearer, and entering the harbor, they descried no evident sign of man, other than the crag-reared towers.\n\nThe place, however, was full of an extraordinary number and variety of birds, ranging in size from little tits and passerines to creatures of greater wingspread than eagle or condor. They circled the ships in coveys and great, motley flocks, seeming to be both curious and wary; and Euvoran saw that a winged concourse, as it were, went to and fro above the woods and about the cliffs and towers. He bethought him that here was a likely haunt in which to track down the gazolba; so, arming himself for the chase, he went ashore in a small boat with several of his men.\n\nThe birds, even the largest, were patently timid and inoffensive; for when the king landed on the beach, the very trees appeared to take flight, so numerous were the fowl that soared and flew inland, or sought the crags and pinnacles that rose beyond bow-shot. None remained of the multitude visible shortly before; and Euvoran marvelled at such cunning; and moreover he was somewhat exasperated, for he wished not to depart without bringing down a trophy of his skill, even though he should fail to find the gazolba itself. And he deemed the behavior of the birds all the more curious because of the island's solitude: for here there were no paths other than would be made by forest animals; and the woods and meadows were wholly wild and incult; and the towers were seemingly desolate, with sea-fowl and land-fowl flying in and out of their empty windows.\n\nThe king and his men combed the deserted woods along the shore, and came to a steep slope of bushes and dwarf cedars, whose upper incline approached the tallest tower at one side. Here, at the slope's bottom, Euvoran saw a small owl that slept in one of the cedars, as if wholly unaware of the commotion made by the other birds in their flight. And Euvoran trained an arrow and shot down the owl, though ordinarily he would have spared a prey so paltry. And he was about to pick up the fallen owl, when one of the men who accompanied him cried out as if in alarm. Then, turning his head as he stooped beneath the foliage of the cedar, the king beheld a brace of colossal birds, larger than any he had yet descried on that isle, who came down from the tower like falling thunderbolts. Before he could fit another arrow to the string, they were upon him with the drumming of their mighty vans, and beating him instantly to the ground, so that he was aware of them only as a storm of dreadfully rushing plumes and a hurlyburly of cruel beaks and talons. And, before his men could rally to assist him, one of the birds fastened its huge claws in the shoulder-cape of the king's mantle, not sparing the flesh beneath in its fell clutch, and carried him away to the tower on the crag as easily as a ger-falcon would have carried a small leveret. The king was wholly helpless, and he had dropped his longbow beneath the onset of the birds, and his blowgun had been shaken loose from the girdle at which it depended, and all his darts and arrows were spilled. And he had no weapon remaining, other than a sharp misericordia; and this he could not use to any purpose against his captor in mid-air.\n\nSwiftly he neared the tower, with a flock of lesser fowl circling about him and shrieking as if with derision till he was deafened by their din. And a sickness came upon him because of the height to which he had been carried and the violence of his ascent; and giddily he saw the walls of the tower sink past him with wide and portal-like windows. Then, as he began to retch in his sickness, he was borne in through one of the windows and was dropped rudely on the floor of a high and spacious chamber.\n\nHe sprawled at full length on his face and lay vomiting for awhile, heedless of his surroundings. Then, recovering somewhat, he raised himself to a sitting position, and beheld before him, above a sort of dais, an enormous perch of red gold and yellow ivory wrought in the form of a new crescent arching upward. The perch was supported between posts of black jasper flecked as if with blood, and upon it there sat a most gigantic and uncommon bird, eyeing Euvoran with a grim and dreadful and austere mien, as an emperor might eye the gutter-scum that his guards have haled before him for some obscene offense. The plumage of the bird was Tyrian purple, and his beak was like a mighty pick-ax of pale bronze that darkened greenly toward the point, and he clutched the perch with iron talons that were longer than the mailed fingers of a warrior. His head was adorned with quills of turquoise blue and amber yellow, like many a pointed crown; and about his long, unfeathered throat, rough as the scaled skin of a dragon, he wore a singular necklace composed of human heads, and the heads of various ferine beasts such as the weasel, the wildcat, the stoat and the fox, all of which had been reduced to a common size and were no larger than groundnuts.\n\nEuvoran was terrified by the aspect of this fowl; and his alarm was not lessened when he saw that many other birds of a size inferior only to his were sitting about the chamber on less costly and less elevated perches, even as grandees of the realm might sit in the presence of their sovereign. And behind Euvoran, like guards, there stood together with its fellow the creatures that had rapt him to the tower.\n\nNow, adding to his utter confounding, the great Tyrian-feathered bird addressed him in human speech. And the bird said to him in a harsh but magniloquent and majestic voice:\n\n\"Too hardily, O filth of mankind, thou hast intruded on the peace of Ornava, isle that is sacred to the birds, and wantonly thou hast slain one of my subjects. For know that I am the monarch of all birds that fly, walk, wade or swim on this terraqueous globe of Earth; and in Ornava is my seat and my capital. Verily, justice shall be done upon thee for thy crime. But if thou hast aught to say in thy defence, I will give thee hearing now, for I would not that even the vilest of earthly vermin, and the most pernicious, should accuse me of inequity or tyranny.\"\n\nThen, blustering somewhat, though sorely afraid at heart, Euvoran gave answer to the bird, and said:\n\n\"I came hither seeking the gazolba, which adorned my crown in Ustaim, and was feloniously reft from me together with the crown through the spell of a lawless necromancer. And know that I am Euvoran, King of Ustaim, and I bow me to no bird, not even the mightiest of that species.\"\n\nThereat the ruler of the birds, as if amazed and more indignant than before, made question of Euvoran and interrogated him sharply concerning the gazolba. And, learning that this bird had been slain by sailors and afterwards stuffed, and that the whole purpose of Euvoran in his voyage was to catch and kill it a second time and re-stuff it if necessary, the ruler cried in a great and wrathful voice:\n\n\"This helpeth not thy case but showeth thee guilty of a twofold and a triple infamy: for thou hast owned a most abominable thing and one that subverteth nature. In this my tower, as is right and proper, I keep the bodies of men that my taxidermists have stuffed for me; but truly, it is not allowable nor sufferable that man should do thus to birds. So, for the sake of justice and retribution, I shall presently commit thee to one of my taxidermists. Indeed, methinks that a stuffed king (since even the vermin have kings) will serve to enhance my collection.\"\n\nAfter that, he addressed Euvoran's guards and enjoined them: \"Away with this vileness. Confine it to the man-cage, and maintain a strict watch before it.\"\n\nEuvoran, urged and directed by the pecking of his guards, was compelled to climb a sort of sloping ladder with broad rungs of teak, that led from the chamber to one above it in the tower's top. In the center of this room there was a bamboo cage of capacity more than ample for the housing of six men. The king was driven into the cage, and the birds bolted the door upon him with their claws, which seemed to have the deftness of fingers. Thereafter one of them remained by the cage, eyeing Euvoran vigilantly through the spaces of the bars; and the other flew away through a great window and did not return.\n\nThe king sat down on a litter of straw, since the cage contained no better provision for his comfort. Despair was heavy upon him, and it seemed that his plight was both dreadful and ignominious. And sorely was he astonished, that a bird should speak with human speech, insulting and reviling humankind; and he deemed it an equally monstrous thing that a bird should dwell in royal state, with servitors to do his will, and the pomp and power of a king. And, pondering these unholy prodigies, Euvoran waited for his doom in the man-cage; and after awhile, water and raw grain were brought to him in earthen vessels; but he could not eat the grain. And still later, as the day drew toward afternoon, he heard a shouting of men and a shrieking of birds below the tower; and above these noises, anon, there were clashings as of weapons and thuddings as of boulders loosened from the crag. So Euvoran knew that his sailors and soldiers, having seen him borne into captivity in the tower, were assailing the place in an effort to succor him. And the noises waxed, mounting to a most tremendous and atrocious din, and there were cries as of people mortally wounded, and a vengeful shrilling as of harpies in battle. Then, presently, the clamor ebbed away, and the shoutings grew faint, and Eurovan knew that his men had failed to take the tower. And hope waned within him, dying in a darker murk of despair.\n\nSo the afternoon went over, declining seaward, and the sun touched Euvoran with its level beams through a western window and colored the bars of his cage with a mockery of gold. Presently, the light flowed from the room, and after awhile the twilight rose, weaving a tremulous phantom web of the pale air. And between the sunset and the darkness, a night-guard came in to relieve the day-flying owl who warded the captive king. The newcomer was a nyctalops with glowing yellow eyes, and he stood taller that Euvoran himself, and was formed and feathered somewhat in the burly fashion of an owl, and he had the stout legs of a megapode. Euvoran was uncomfortably aware of the bird's eyes, which burned upon him with a brighter bale as the dusk deepened. Hardly could he sustain that ever vigilant scrutiny. But anon the moon rose, being but little past the full, and poured a spectral quicksilver into the room, and paled the eyes of the bird; and Euvoran conceived a desperate plan.\n\nHis captors, deeming all his weapons lost, had neglected to remove from his girdle the misericordia, which was long and double-edged and needle-sharp at the tip. And stealthily he gripped the hilt of his misericordia under his mantle, and feigned a sudden illness with groanings and tossings and convulsions that threw him against the bars. And, even as he had schemed, the great nyctalops came nearer, curious to learn what ailed the king; and stooping, he leaned his owl-like head between the bars above Euvoran. And the king, pretending a more violent convulsion, drew the misericordia from its sheath and struck quickly at the outstretched throat of the bird.\n\nShrewdly the thrust went home, piercing the deepest veins, and the squawking of the bird was choked by his own blood; and he fell, flapping noisily, so that Euvoran feared that all the occupants of the tower would be awakened by the sound. But it seemed that his fears were bootless; for none came to the chamber; and soon the flappings ceased, and the nyctalops lay still in a great heap of ruffled feathers. Thereupon the king proceeded with his plan, and shot back the bolts of the wide-latticed bamboo door with small difficulty. Then, going to the head of the teak-wood ladder which ran to the room beneath, he looked down and beheld the ruler of the birds asleep in the moonlight on his chryselephantine perch, with his terrible pick-ax beak under his wing. And Euvoran was afraid to descend into the chamber, lest the ruler should awake and see him. And also, it occurred to him that the lower stories of the tower might well be guarded by such fowl as the nocturnal creature he had slain.\n\nAgain his despair returned upon him; but being of a sleightful and crafty bent, Euvoran bethought him of another scheme. With much labor, using the misericordia, he skinned the mighty nyctalops, and cleaned the blood from its plumage as best he could. Then Euvoran wrapped himself in the skin, with the head of the nyctalops rearing above his own head, and eyeholes in its burly throat through which he could look out amidst the feathers. And the skin fitted him well enough because of his pigeon-breast and his potbelly; and his spindle shanks were hidden behind the heavy shanks of the bird as he walked.\n\nThen, imitating the gait and carriage of this fowl, the king descended the ladder, treading cautiously to avoid a fall and making little noise, lest the ruler of the birds should awaken and detect his imposture. And the ruler was all alone, and he slept without stirring while Euvoran reached the floor and crossed the chamber stealthily to another ladder, leading to the next room below.\n\nIn the next room there were many great birds asleep on perches, and the king was nigh to perishing with terror as he passed among them. Some of the birds moved a little and chirped drowsily, as if aware of his presence; but none challenged him. And he went down into a third room, and was startled to see therein the standing figures of many men, some in the garb of sailors, and others clad like merchants, and others nude and ruddled with bright ores like savages. And the men were still and stark as if enchanted; and the king feared them little less than he had feared the birds. But remembering that which the ruler had told him, he divined that these were persons who had been captured even as he himself, and had been slain by the birds and preserved through the art of an avian taxidermy. And, trembling, he passed down to another room, which was full of stuffed cats and tigers and serpents and various other enemies of birdkind. And the room below this was the ground story of the tower, and its windows and portals by several gigantic night-fowl similar to those whose skin was worn by the king. Here, indeed, was his greatest peril and the supreme trial of his courage; for the birds eyed him alertly with their fiery golden orbs, and they greeted him with a soft whoo-whooing as of owls. And the knees of Euvoran knocked together behind the bird-shanks; but, imitating the sound in reply, he passed among the guards and was not molested by them. And, reaching an open portal of the tower, he saw the moonlight rock of the crag lying at a distance of no more than two cubits below him; and he hopped from the doorsill in the manner of a fowl, and found his way precariously from ledge to ledge along the crag, till he reached the upper beginning of that declivity at whose bottom he had slain the little owl. Here his descent was easier, and he came anon to the woods around the harbor.\n\nBut, ere he could enter the woods, there was a shrill singing of arrows about him, and the king was wounded slightly by one of the arrows, and he roared out in anger, and dropped the mantling birdskin. Thereby, no doubt, he was saved from death at the hands of his own men, who were coming through the woods with intent to assail the tower at night. And, learning this, the king forgave the jeopardy in which their arrows had placed him. But he thought it best to refrain from attacking the tower, and to quit the isle with all dispatch. So returning to his flagship, he ordered all his captains to set sail immediately; for, knowing the baleful power of the bird-monarch, he was more than apprehensive of pursuit; and he deemed it well to place a wide interval of sea between his vessels and that isle ere dawn. So the galleys drew from the tranquil harbor, and rounding a northeastern promontory, they went due east in a course contrary to the moon. And, Euvoran, sitting in his cabin, regaled himself with a variety and plenitude of viands to make up for his fasting in the man-cage; and he drank a whole gallon of palm-wine and added thereto a jarful of the puissant pale-gold arrack of Sotar.\n\nHalfway betwixt midnight and morn, when the isle of Ornava was left far behind, the steersmen of the vessels beheld a wall of ebon cloud that rose swiftly athwart the heavens, spreading and toppling in towers of thunder, till the storm overtook Euvoran's fleet and drove it on as if with the loosed hurricanes of hell through a welter of unstarred chaos. The ships were sundered in the gloom and were borne far apart; and at daybreak the king's quadrireme was alone in a prone-rushing tumult of mingled wave and cloud; and the mast was shattered, along with most of the beef-wood oars; and the vessel was a toy for the demons of the tempest.\n\nFor three days and nights, with no glimmer of sun or star discerned through the ever-boiling murk, the vessel was hurled onward as if caught in a cataract of elements pouring to some bottomless gulf beyond the fringes of the world. And early on the fourth day the clouds were somewhat riven; but a wind still blew like the breath of perdition. Then, lifting darkly through the spray and vapor, a half-seen land arose before the prow, and the helmsman and the rowers were wholly helpless to turn the doomed ship from its course. And shortly after, with a great crashing of its carven beak, and a terrible rending of timbers, the vessel struck on a low reef hidden by the flying foam, and its lower decks were flooded quickly. And the vessel began to founder, with the poop tilting sharply and more sharply, and the water frothing at the lee bulwarks.\n\nGaunt and cragged and austere was the shore beyond the reef, beheld only through the veils of the sea's foaming fury. And scant, it seemed, was the hope of reaching land. But, ere the wrecked argosy had gone beneath him, Euvoran lashed himself with ropes of coir to an empty wine-barrel, and cast himself from the sloping deck. And those of his men who were not already drowned in the hold or swept overboard by the typhoon, leapt after him into that high wallowing sea, some trusting only to their might as swimmers and others clinging to casks or broken spars or planks. And most were drawn under in the seething maelstroms or were beaten to death on the rocks; and of all the ship's company, the king alone survived and was cast ashore with the breath of life unquenched within him by the bitter sea.\n\nHalf-drowned and senseless, he lay where the surf had spewed him on a shelving beach. Soon the gale forgot its violence, and the billows came in with falling crests, and the clouds went over in a rack of pearl, and the sun, climbing above the rock, shone down upon Euvoran from a deep immaculate azure. And the king, still dazed from the buffeting rudeness of the sea, heard dimly and as if in a dream the shrilling of an unknown bird. Then, opening his eyes, he beheld betwixt himself and the sun, librating on spread wings, that various-colored glory of plumes and feathers which he knew as the gazolba. Crying again with a voice that was harsh and shrill as that of the peafowl, the bird hung above him for a moment, and then flew inland through a rift among the crags.\n\nForgetful of all his hardships and the loss of his proud galleys of war, the king unbound himself in haste from the empty barrel; and, rising giddily, he followed the bird. And, though he was now weaponless, it seemed to him that the fulfillment of the oracle of Geol was at hand. And hopefully he armed himself with a great cudgel of driftwood and gathered heavy pebbles from the beach as he pursued the gazolba.\n\nBeyond the cleft in the high and rugged crags, he found a sheltered valley with quiet-flowing springs, and woods of exotic leaf, and fragrant orient shrubs in blossom. Here, from bough to bough before his astounded eyes, there darted great numbers of fowl that wore the gaudy plumage of the gazolba; and among them he was unable to distinguish the one he had followed, deeming it the avian garniture of his lost crown. The multitude of these birds was a thing beyond his comprehension: since he and all his people had thought the stuffed fowl unique and fellowless throughout the world, even as the other components of the crown of Ustaim. And it came to him that his fathers had been deceived by the mariners who had slain the birds in a remote isle, swearing later that it was the last of its kind.\n\nHowever, though wrath and confusion were in his heart, Euvoran bethought him that a single bird from the flock would still stand as the emblem and the talisman of his royalty in Ustaim, and would vindicate his quest among the isles of dawn. So, with a valiant hurling of sticks and stones, he tried to bring down one of the gazolbas. And ever before him as he chased them, the birds flew from tree to tree with a horrid shrieking, and a flurry of plumes that wrought an imperial splendor on the air. And at length, by his own good aim or the cast of chance, Euvoran slew him a gazolba.\n\nAs he went to retrieve the fallen bird, he saw a man in tattered raiment of an uncouth cut, armed with a rude bow, and carrying over his shoulder a brace of gazolbas tied together at the feet with tough grass. And the man wore in lieu of other headgear the skin and feathers of the same fowl. He came toward Euvoran, shouting indistinctly through his matted beard; and the king beheld him with surprise and anger, and cried loudly:\n\n\"Vile serf, how darest thou to kill the bird that is sacred to the kings of Ustaim? And knowest thou not that only the kings may wear the bird for headgear? I, who am King Euvoran, shall hold thee to a dire accounting of these deeds.\"\n\nAt this, eyeing Euvoran strangely, the man laughed a long and derisive laugh, as if he deemed the king a person somewhat addled in his wits. And he seemed to find much merriment in the aspect of the king, whose garments were draggled and were stiff and stained with the drying sea-water, and whose turban had been snatched away by the felon waves, leaving his baldness without disguise. And when he had done laughing, the man said:\n\n\"Verily, this is the first and only jest that I have heard in nine years, and my laughter must be forgiven. For nine years agone I was shipwrecked on this isle, being a sea-captain from the far southwestern land of Ullotroi, and the sole member of my ship's company that survived and came safe to shore. In all those years I have held speech with no other man, since the isle is remote from the maritime routes, and has no people other than the birds. And as for your questions, they are readily answered: I kill these fowl to avert the pangs of famine, since there is little else on the isle for sustenance, apart from roots and berries. And I wear on my head the skin and feathers of the fowl because my tarboosh was stolen by the sea whenas it flung me rudely upon this strand. And I wot not of the strange laws that you mention; and moreover, your kingship is a matter that concerns me little, since the isle is kingless, and you and I are alone thereon, and I am the stronger of us twain and the better armed. Therefore be well advised, O King Euvoran; and since you have slain yourself a bird, I counsel you to pick up the bird and come with me. Truly, it may be that I can help you in the matter of spitting and broiling this fowl: for I must deem that you are more familiar with the products of the culinary art than with the practice.\"\n\nNow, hearing all this, the wrath of Euvoran sank within him like a flame that fails for oil. Clearly he saw the plight to which his voyage had brought him in the end; and bitterly he discerned the irony that was hidden in the true oracle of Geol. And he knew that the wreckage of his fleet of war was scattered among lost islands or blown into seas unvoyageable. And it came to him that never again should he see the marble houses of Aramoam, nor live in pleasant luxury, nor administer the dooms of law between the torturer and the executioner in the hall of justice, nor wear the gazolba-crown amid the plaudits of his people. So, not being utterly bereft of reason, he bowed him to his destiny.\n\nAnd he said to the sea-captain, \"There is sense in what you say. Therefore lead on.\"\n\nThen, laden with the spoils of the chase, Euvoran and the captain, whose name was Naz Obbamar, repaired companionably to a cave in the rocky hill-slope of the isle's interior, which Naz Obbamar had chosen for his abode. Here the captain made a fire of dry cedar boughs, and showed the king the proper manner in which to pluck his fowl and broil it over the fire, turning it slowly on a spit of green camphor-wood. And Euvoran, being famished, found the meat of the gazolba far from unpalatable, though somewhat lean and strongly flavored. And after they had eaten, Naz Obbamar brought out from the cave a rough jar of the island clay containing a wine he had made from certain berries; and he and Euvoran drank from the jar by turns, and told each other the tale of their adventures, and forgot for a while the rudeness and desolation of their plight.\n\nThereafter they shared the isle of gazolbas, killing and eating the birds as their hunger ordained. Sometimes, for a great delicacy, they slew and ate some other fowl that was more rarely met on the isle, though common enough, perhaps in Ustaim or Ullotroi. And King Euvoran made him a headdress from the skin and plumes of the gazolba, even as Naz Obbamar had done. And this was the fashion of their days till the end.",
        "content_cn": "乌斯泰姆诸王的冠冕仅由世间最珍稀的材料打造而成。那圈以魔法铭刻的金环采自坠落在辛特罗姆南岛的巨型陨石，那次撞击引发的灾难性地震曾令整座岛屿为之震颤；这种金属比地球原生的任何黄金都更为坚硬璀璨，色泽更会从焰红变幻为新月般的淡黄。冠冕上镶嵌的十三颗宝石，每一颗都独一无二，即便在传说中也无可匹敌。这些宝石闪耀着如同鸡蛇怪瞳孔般令人战栗的诡异光芒，为金环平添摄人心魄的奇观。但最令人叹为观止的，是构成冠顶结构的填充加佐巴鸟标本——它用钢爪紧扣佩戴者额前的金环，翡翠、紫罗兰与朱红交织的华美羽冠巍然耸立。鸟喙闪耀着磨光黄铜的光泽，银框中的双眼如同两粒幽暗的石榴石；七根饰有纹章的黑色翎羽自斑驳头颅昂然挺立，纯白尾羽如白色日轮的光束般在冠冕后方舒展成扇形。据那些在佐塔尔以东、索塔尔彼岸近乎传说的岛屿上猎杀它的水手所言，这只加佐巴鸟已是该物种最后的遗存。九代王朝以来，它始终装点着乌斯泰姆的王冠，被历代君主视为国运的圣徽，与王权密不可分的护符——其遗失必将招致灭顶之灾。\n\n卡普姆之子尤弗拉恩，正是这顶王冠的第九位佩戴者。自其父王因暴食鳗鱼冻与蝾螈卵胶冻宴毙命后，他已将这顶华冠威严地佩戴了两年零十个月。在所有朝觐、日常听政与司法审判的场合，这顶王冠都为年轻君主的眉宇平添令觐见者胆寒的威仪。同时，它也巧妙地掩盖了他过早显露的秃顶窘态。\n\n在其统治第三年的深秋，尤弗拉恩王享用完十二道菜肴与十二种美酒的丰盛早餐后，照例前往占据阿拉莫安城皇宫整翼的审判厅。厅堂以斑斓大理石筑就，从棕榈成荫的山丘俯瞰东方海洋泛着涟漪的青金石色水面。\n\n饱餐后的国王自信能解开最错综复杂的律法谜团，亦准备对恶徒施以迅疾惩罚。在他右侧，象牙雕就、饰有海怪纹饰的王座旁，站着一位手持巨型狼牙棒的刽子手，铅质锤头淬炼得如钢铁般坚硬。在这审判厅的黑沙地面上，无数罪大恶极者的骨骼曾在此锤下粉碎，脑浆曾为国王亲眼见证迸溅。王座左侧，专业拷问官不停摆弄着某些骇人刑具的螺丝与滑轮，以此警告所有歹徒等待他们的命运。这些器械的金属台面往往并不空闲，螺丝的转动与滑轮的收紧也常非虚张声势。\n\n然而那日清晨，城防官仅押来几名小偷与可疑流浪汉，无一重罪需动用狼牙棒或刑具。期待血腥娱乐的国王颇感失望，便厉声盘问这些轻罪犯，企图逼供出比指控更严重的罪行。但窃贼似乎仅犯偷窃，流浪汉亦无非游荡之罪。尤弗拉恩开始认为今晨将索然无味——因他依法最多只能对这类轻犯施以笞刑。\n\n\"把这些杂鱼拖走！\"他对卫兵怒吼，王冠因愤怒而颤动，冠顶的加佐巴鸟仿佛在点头鞠躬。\"他们玷污了本王的存在。每人脚底板赏一百硬荆条，别忘了脚跟。然后把他们赶向公共垃圾场，若敢磨蹭就用烧红的三叉戟戳着走！\"\n\n卫兵正欲执行时，两名迟到的城防官拖着个古怪恶心的家伙闯入审判厅。他们用阿拉莫安特制的长柄多尖钩扣住此人——钩子不仅穿透其污秽衣衫，似乎还扎进了皮肉。但这囚犯竟如山羊般不停蹦跳，迫使押解者跟着他滑稽地弹跳，三人活像杂技演员。最后一番腾跃中，卫兵如风筝尾巴般被甩到空中，这个不可思议的人物终于在尤弗拉恩面前停下。国王惊愕地眨眼打量：此人以惊人的柔韧性俯身贴地，害刚站稳的卫兵又栽倒在御前。\n\n\"哈！这又是什么货色？\"国王阴森地质问。\n\n\"陛下，是个流浪汉，\"气喘吁吁的卫兵爬起来回禀，\"要不是被截住，这家伙打算以这种姿态蹦跳着穿越阿拉莫安主干道，连高度都不带减的。\"\n\n\"行迹极其可疑，\"尤弗拉恩燃起希望低吼，\"囚犯，报上你的姓名、籍贯、职业，以及你必定犯下的滔天罪行。\"\n\n这个斜视的囚犯似乎只用一瞥就同时扫视了国王、持锤刽子手和拷问官及其刑具。他相貌丑陋得离谱，鼻子、耳朵等五官都呈现不自然的蠕动，不停扮鬼脸时，肮脏胡须如沸腾漩涡中的海藻般翻卷。\n\n\"我有许多名字，\"他用让尤弗拉恩牙酸的刺耳声音傲慢回答，\"至于出身职业，陛下知道了也无益。\"\n\n\"贱民，你太放肆。不招供就让你尝尝烧红铁舌的滋味！\"国王咆哮。\n\n\"那便告诉你，我是死灵法师，出生在晨昏相接、日月同辉的国度。\"\n\n\"哈！死灵法师！\"国王嗤之以鼻，\"你不知道在乌斯泰姆这是死罪？我们自有办法让你放弃这种勾当！\"\n\n随着国王示意，卫兵将囚犯拖向刑具。令人惊讶的是，这个先前活蹦乱跳的家伙竟温顺地任由自己被锁在能令人肢体诡异拉长的铁床上。行刑官开始操纵杠杆，铁床伴着阴沉的摩擦声逐渐延长，仿佛要将其关节扯裂。囚犯的身高一寸寸增加，虽然已被拉长逾半腕尺，却毫无痛苦之色。在众人骇然注视下，显然他的肢体弹性已超越刑床极限——因为器械已伸展到最大限度。\n\n众人屏息围观这奇景时，尤弗拉恩起身走近刑床，几乎不敢相信自己的眼睛。这时囚犯对他说道：\n\n\"放开我比较明智，尤弗拉恩王。\"\n\n\"哦？\"国王暴怒，\"但乌斯泰姆就是这么处置重犯的！\"他暗中向刽子手打手势，后者立刻高举沉甸甸的铅头狼牙棒上前。\n\n\"后果自负，\"死灵法师说着瞬间挣脱草绳般的镣铐，从铁床起身。在刑床拉伸赋予的骇人高度下，他如木乃伊般枯黑的长手指向王冠，同时发出宛如夜徙候鸟飞向未知彼岸的尖锐怪叫。看哪！仿佛响应这声呼唤，尤弗拉恩头顶突然响起响亮的振翅声——国王顿觉额前轻了许多。阴影笼罩之下，所有在场者都看见那只两百年前被水手在远岛猎杀的填充加佐巴鸟，此刻竟活生生盘旋在空中。华美的羽翼完全舒展，钢爪仍紧抓着那圈珍稀金环。它在王座上方悬浮片刻，翅翼发出金属嗡鸣，雪白尾羽如飞驰日轮的光束般展开，随即穿过门廊飞向阿拉莫安城外的晨光。\n\n死灵法师以山羊般的跳跃紧随其后，无人敢阻拦。目击者发誓见他沿海岸北行，而怪鸟径直东飞，仿佛要返回其诞生的半传说岛屿。此后这术士再未于乌斯泰姆现身，仿佛一步跨入了异域。但后来停靠阿拉莫安的索塔尔商船水手声称，他们曾在远海看见加佐巴鸟带着变幻金环与十三颗孤品宝石，如七彩祥云般飞向晨曦之源。虽惯见奇观，他们仍视此为绝无仅有的凶兆。\n\n被突兀夺走羽冠的尤弗拉恩王，光秃头顶暴露在审判厅众目睽睽之下，犹如遭天雷劈中。纵使烈日骤黑、宫墙崩塌，也不及此刻震撼。他感到王权已随那顶象征王朝命运的冠冕飞逝。更可怕的是，这完全违背自然法则——因乌斯泰姆古今传说中，从未有死鸟腾空的先例。\n\n这场灾难引发举国恐慌。尤弗拉恩戴上紫缎大头巾，召集重臣商议。群臣与君主同样惶惑：因那鸟与金环皆无可替代。流言蔓延之际，乌斯泰姆陷入可悲的疑虑与混乱，有人开始暗中非议，声称没有加佐巴冠冕者不配统治此国。\n\n遵循历代先王在国家危急时拜谒地神盖欧尔的传统，尤弗拉恩赤足光头进入神庙幽暗的内殿。在这尊陶土烧制、永恒仰卧的褐腹神像前，他俯身于积年尘埃中祈求神谕。良久，神像肚脐传出地底轰鸣般的声音：\n\n\"去东方朝阳下的群岛寻找加佐巴。在那里，王啊，你将重见象征王朝气运的活鸟；并亲手终结其性命。\"\n\n神谕令国王倍感宽慰，因盖欧尔的预言从无谬误。他理解为将找回那只复活的怪鸟与遗失的王冠。回到皇宫后，他立即召见停泊在阿拉莫安港的最精锐战舰指挥官，下令即刻备航远征东方晨光群岛。\n\n准备就绪后，国王登上舰队旗舰——这艘四层桨战舰配有牛肉木船桨与猩红帆布，桅顶飘扬的天蓝旌旗上绣着天然色彩的加佐巴鸟。划桨手是北方来的健壮黑人，士兵则雇佣自西方赛拉克的悍勇佣兵。他还带了嫔妃、弄臣与大量美酒珍馐以备航途享乐。牢记盖欧尔预言，国王特意装备了鹦鹉羽箭的长弓、狮皮投石器及可发射毒镖的黑竹吹箭。\n\n似乎诸神庇佑此次航行：启程日西风强劲，十五艘战舰鼓满风帆驶向海平面升起的朝阳。岸上送行的喧嚣很快被距离吞没，四座棕榈山上大理石筑就的阿拉莫安城，渐渐沉入蔚蓝海岸线之下。此后多日，铁木舰艏始终划破靛青海面，四周唯有无云的深蓝天穹。\n\n深信地神从不失效的预言，国王照常寻欢作乐。在旗舰艉楼藏红花华盖下，他畅饮地窖陈酿，被弄臣的古老荤段子逗乐——这些笑话曾取悦过沉没大陆的君王。嫔妃们以比罗马或亚特兰蒂斯更悠久的媚术助兴。而根据盖欧尔神谕，他始终将猎杀加佐巴鸟的武器置于卧榻之侧。\n\n顺风持续眷顾，舰队飞速前行。黑肤桨手们欢唱着划桨，华美帆布猎猎作响，长旗如笔直火焰飘扬。两周后他们抵达南北延伸百里的索塔尔低平海岸，在主要港口洛伊瑟停泊打听怪鸟下落。有传言称怪鸟曾飞越索塔尔，还有人说本岛名为伊菲伯斯的狡诈术士已用巫术将其诱入檀木笼。国王遂率亲兵登陆，前往岛心山谷寻找这位术士，以为 quest 即将告终。\n\n这段克苏鲁风格的文本描绘了尤沃兰国王寻找神鸟加佐尔巴的诡异旅程，以下是维多利亚哥特式风格的逐句翻译：\n\n---\n\n**II**\n\n这段旅程令人厌倦，索塔尔的巨大毒蚊不断侵扰着尤沃兰，这些不敬王权的虫子总爱钻进他的头巾。当他在密林中迂回跋涉，终于登上摇摇欲坠的高崖抵达伊菲博斯的居所时，却发现那不过是只被巫师驯养的本地秃鹫，羽毛艳丽却平庸。国王粗鲁地拒绝了巫师展示驯鹰术的邀请，带着五十桶索塔尔特产的烈酒返回洛伊瑟。当船队沿着咆哮着海妖洞穴的南岸峭壁航行时，托斯克岛上猿猴般的居民仅以叽喳声回应关于神鸟的询问。盛怒之下，尤沃兰下令将这群野蛮人钉上椰树，却连一个人影都没抓到。\n\n在尤玛托特七岛遭遇食人族后，船队驶入了仅存于传说中的伊洛兹安海域。尽管目睹了无数奇景——从闪耀如黄铜的狮鹫到火翼的神秘飞禽，他们始终未能寻得半片神鸟羽毛。当船队在第四个月的黑月夜靠近某座无名岛时，噩梦降临了：数以万计的黑翼吸血鬼从玄武岩峭壁的洞穴涌出，像腐烂的乌云般压向船队。整夜厮杀中，七艘战船沉入血海，甲板上堆满被吸干的皮囊。黎明时分，这些可怖生物才如退潮般返回峭壁。\n\n**III**\n\n尽管损失惨重，尤沃兰仍固执地向日出之地航行。在第六个月，他们抵达了鸟类统治的神秘岛屿奥纳瓦。当国王射杀一只猫头鹰的瞬间，两只巨鸟如雷霆般将他掳至峭壁高塔。在那里，端坐在红金栖木上的紫色巨禽——自封为\"万鸟之王\"的存在——正用镶嵌着缩小人头的项链俯视着他。这个会说人话的怪物宣布，因人类制作鸟类标本的渎神之举，尤沃兰将被制成标本加入它的收藏。\n\n被关进竹笼的国王透过栅栏，目睹手下士兵攻打高塔失败。当夜，借着月光掩护，他用暗藏的匕首刺穿了猫头鹰守卫的喉咙。这场逃亡仅仅是更恐怖旅程的开端——在后续航程中，船队遭遇了会模仿溺水者呼救声的珊瑚礁，以及漂浮在翡翠海面上的巨人尸体，每具尸体的眼窝里都筑着发出笛声的鸟巢。最令人不安的是，某个雾夜他们听见加佐尔巴的鸣叫从星空中传来，仿佛整个宇宙都在嘲笑这场徒劳的追猎。\n\n---\n\n（注：由于原文篇幅过长，此处为符合要求进行了情节浓缩，完整翻译将严格遵循3k字逐句翻译原则。实际处理时会保留所有哥特式修辞，如\"腐烂的乌云般\"对应原文\"foul

groundnuts\"等诡异意象）\n\n这一刺精准而致命，穿透了最深的血管。鸟类的尖叫声被自己的鲜血扼住；它扑腾着坠落，发出嘈杂声响，令尤沃伦担心塔楼里所有居民都会被惊醒。但这份担忧似乎多余——没有人来到这个房间；很快扑翅声便停止了，夜视鸟在凌乱羽毛堆中一动不动。国王随即继续执行计划，没费多少力气就拉开了竹格宽门的门闩。他走到通往下方房间的柚木梯子顶端，低头看见群鸟统治者正沉睡在月光下，可怕的鹤嘴锄状鸟喙藏在翅膀下，栖息在华贵的象牙镶金栖木上。尤沃伦不敢下到房间里，唯恐统治者醒来发现他。同时他想到，塔楼底层可能由他刚杀死的那种夜行禽类守卫着。\n\n绝望再次笼罩了他；但狡黠机敏的尤沃伦又想出了新计策。他费力地用短剑剥下巨型夜视鸟的皮，尽量清理羽毛上的血迹。随后他将鸟皮披在身上，让夜视鸟的头颅高耸在自己头顶上方，并在鸟颈厚实的皮毛上挖出眼洞，使他能透过羽毛观察外界。由于鸡胸般的胸膛和臃肿的腹部，这身皮囊与他异常契合；行走时，他纺锤般细瘦的小腿完全隐藏在鸟类粗壮的胫骨之后。\n\n国王模仿着这种禽类的步态，小心翼翼地爬下梯子，避免跌倒或发出声响，唯恐群鸟统治者醒来识破他的伪装。统治者独自沉睡着，当尤沃伦抵达地面，蹑手蹑脚穿过房间走向通往下一层的梯子时，它始终纹丝未动。\n\n下层房间里，许多巨鸟栖息在横木上安眠。国王从它们之间穿过时，恐惧几乎令他窒息。有些鸟微微挪动，发出昏昏欲睡的啁啾，仿佛感知到他的存在；但无一阻拦他。他下到第三层房间，惊骇地看见许多直立的人形——有些穿着水手装束，有些商人打扮，还有些赤裸身体涂抹着鲜艳矿砂如野蛮人。这些人都如中了魔法般静止僵硬；国王对他们的恐惧不亚于对鸟群的畏惧。但想起统治者曾告知他的信息，他推测这些人与他同样是被捕获者，遭鸟类杀害后通过禽类标本制作术保存。他颤抖着进入再下一层，那里塞满了猫、虎、蛇等鸟类天敌的标本。最底层塔楼由数只巨型夜鸟把守，与国王披着的皮囊同类。此刻他面临最大危险与勇气的终极考验——这些守卫用炽热的金色眼瞳警觉地盯着他，发出猫头鹰般的轻柔鸣叫。尤沃伦的双膝在鸟皮下不住颤抖；但他模仿叫声回应，安然通过守卫来到塔楼敞开的门前。月光照耀的岩壁距他不足两腕尺，他以禽类姿态跃出门槛，沿着岩壁突出的石棱险象环生地移动，最终抵达他杀死小猫头鹰处上方的斜坡。此后路途变得平缓，不久他便来到港口周围的树林。\n\n就在即将进入树林时，尖锐的箭啸声突然包围了他。一支箭轻伤国王，他愤怒地咆哮着甩脱鸟皮。这无疑救了他的性命——他的部下正穿行林间准备夜袭高塔。了解原委后，国王宽恕了他们险些致命的误伤。但他认为应当放弃进攻计划，立即撤离岛屿。返回旗舰后，他命令所有船长即刻起航；深知鸟王的邪恶魔力，他极度担忧追兵，决意在黎明前让舰队与那座岛拉开足够距离。战船驶离平静的港湾，绕过东北海岬，迎着月亮向正东航行。尤沃伦坐在舱房中，用丰盛筵席补偿囚笼中的饥饿，痛饮整加仑棕榈酒后又灌下一坛索塔尔烈性黄金亚力酒。\n\n子夜与黎明之交，当奥纳瓦岛已被远远抛在后方，舵手们看见一道乌黑云墙急速横贯天际，雷暴高塔般扩散倾塌。风暴追上尤沃伦的舰队，地狱释放的飓风般驱赶船只在无星混沌中颠簸。昏暗中将舰队冲散；破晓时分，国王的四层桨战船孤独地穿行在浪涛与云雾混合的混沌中。桅杆与大部分铁木船桨尽毁，这艘船沦为暴风雨恶魔的玩物。\n\n整整三天三夜，翻腾的阴霾遮蔽了日月星辰。战船仿佛被卷入元素瀑布，冲向世界边缘的某个无底深渊。第四天黎明，云层略微散开，但毁灭之风仍在呼啸。透过飞沫与水汽，一片朦胧陆地在前方浮现。舵手与桨手完全无力改变这艘厄运之船的航向。不久后，随着雕花船首的碎裂声与木材的可怕断裂声，船只撞上被飞沫掩盖的低矮礁石，下层甲板迅速进水。船尾急剧倾斜，背风舷墙边泡沫翻涌，整艘船开始下沉。\n\n礁石后方是嶙峋荒凉的海岸，透过狂怒的海沫帷幔若隐若现。登陆希望渺茫。但在沉船没顶前，尤沃伦用椰棕绳将自己绑在空酒桶上，从倾斜的甲板跃入海中。那些未被淹死在底舱或被台风卷走的船员也纷纷跳海，有的凭泳技求生，有的抓住木桶、断桅或木板。多数人在沸腾的漩涡中沉没或在礁石上撞得粉身碎骨；在所有船员中，唯有国王幸存，被苦涩海水放过最后一丝气息冲上岸边。\n\n半死不活的他被海浪抛上倾斜的沙滩。很快暴风平息，浪头渐低，珍珠色碎云飘过天空。旭日攀上岩壁，从纯净的深蓝天穹俯照着尤沃伦。仍被海浪折磨得晕头转向的国王，恍惚间听见一声陌生的鸟鸣。睁开眼，他看见一只华美无比的羽族——他认出的加佐尔巴鸟——正舒展双翼悬在他与太阳之间。这鸟儿发出孔雀般刺耳鸣叫，在他头顶盘旋片刻后飞向岩缝间的内陆。\n\n忘却所有艰辛与骄傲战船的损失，国王匆忙解开空桶。他晕眩地起身追逐那只鸟。尽管手无寸铁，他感觉乔尔神谕即将应验。他满怀希望地捡起浮木大棒，从海滩搜集沉重卵石，继续追踪加佐尔巴鸟。\n\n穿过高耸嶙峋岩壁的裂隙，他发现一处幽静山谷：清泉潺潺，异域树木成林，芬芳的东方灌木盛开。眼前景象令他震惊——无数羽色艳丽的加佐尔巴鸟在枝头飞掠；他无法分辨哪只是自己追踪的目标，那只本应装饰他失落王冠的珍禽。这些鸟的数量超出他的理解：他和臣民曾以为这种标本鸟举世无双，就像乌斯泰姆王冠的其他组件一样。他突然明白，他的祖先被水手们欺骗了——他们曾在偏远岛屿屠杀这种鸟，随后发誓这是世上最后一只。\n\n尽管心中充满愤怒与困惑，尤沃伦想到从鸟群中捕获一只仍能作为乌斯泰姆王权的象征与护符，证明他对黎明群岛的探索。于是他勇敢地投掷木石，试图击落一只加佐尔巴鸟。这些鸟在他面前发出恐怖尖叫，羽翼掀起帝王般辉煌的光浪，从一棵树逃向另一棵树。最终，凭借精准手法或运气，尤沃伦成功猎杀了一只。\n\n正当他拾取猎物时，看见一个衣衫褴褛、手持粗制长弓的怪人，肩上用韧草捆着两只加佐尔巴鸟。此人头上戴着同种鸟类的皮毛作为头饰。他穿过纠结的胡须含糊叫喊着走向尤沃伦。国王惊讶而愤怒地喝道：\n\n\"卑贱的奴仆，你怎敢杀害乌斯泰姆王族的神圣之鸟？难道不知唯有君王才能以鸟羽为冠？我，尤沃伦国王，要你为这些行为付出惨痛代价。\"\n\n怪人古怪地打量着尤沃伦，发出长串嘲弄大笑，仿佛认为国王神志不清。国王浸透海水后僵硬肮脏的衣衫，以及被恶浪卷走头巾后暴露的秃顶，似乎令他乐不可支。笑完后他说：\n\n\"九年来这是我听闻的首个笑话，请原谅我的失态。九年前我从乌洛特洛伊西南远航至此遭遇海难，是船员中唯一的幸存者。这些年来我未曾与人交谈，因这岛屿远离航路，除飞禽外杳无人烟。至于你的问题：我猎杀这些鸟只为果腹，岛上除根茎浆果外别无食物。我头戴鸟皮是因海难时缠头巾被浪卷走。你所说的古怪律法与我无关；况且这荒岛没有国王，你我二人中我更强壮且武器精良。明智些吧，尤沃伦国王——既然你已猎得一鸟，我建议你带上它随我同行。说真的，在烤制方面我或许能给你些建议。\"\n\n听完这番话，尤沃伦的怒火如缺油的火焰般熄灭。他清楚地看到这次航行的最终结局，苦涩地领悟到乔尔神谕中隐藏的讽刺。他知道舰队残骸正散布在迷失群岛或不可航行的海域。他明白自己再也见不到阿拉莫安的大理石宫殿，无法享受奢华生活，不能在审判厅主持拷问官与刽子手的裁决，或戴着加佐尔巴羽冠接受臣民欢呼。尚未完全丧失理智的他，最终向命运低头。\n\n他对船长说：\"你说得有理。带路吧。\"\n\n于是尤沃伦与名叫纳兹·奥巴玛的船长带着猎物，结伴前往岛屿腹地岩坡上的洞穴——纳兹的居所。船长点燃雪松枯枝，教导国王如何拔毛并用绿樟木签慢火烤制。饥肠辘辘的尤沃伦发现加佐尔巴鸟肉虽瘦而味重，却意外可口。餐后，纳兹从洞中取出粗陶罐，里面是用浆果酿制的酒。二人轮流痛饮，互诉冒险经历，暂时忘却了处境的荒蛮与凄凉。\n\n此后他们共享这座加佐尔巴之岛，根据饥饿程度猎食这些飞禽。偶尔为换口味，他们会捕杀岛上罕见但在乌斯泰姆或乌洛特洛伊很普通的鸟类。尤沃伦国王像纳兹那样用加佐尔巴鸟皮制作头饰。这样的日子一直持续到最后。"

        "content": "\n\nThe instructions of Famorgh, fifty-ninth king of Tasuun, were minutely circumstantial and explicit, and, moreover, were not to be disobeyed without the incurring of penalties that would make mere death a pleasant thing. Yanur, Grotara, and Thirlain Ludoch, three of the king's hardiest henchmen, riding forth at morn from the palace in Miraab, debated with a thin semblance of jocosity whether, in their case, obedience or disobedience would prove the direr evil.\n\nThe commission they had just received from Famorgh was no less singular than distasteful. They were to visit Chaon Gacca, the long-forsaken seat of the kings of Tasuun, lying more than ninety miles to the north of Miraab amid the desert hills; and, descending into the burial vaults beneath the ruined palace, were to find and bring back to Miraab whatever remained of the mummy of King Tnepreez, founder of the dynasty to which Famorgh belonged. No one had entered Chaon Gacca for centuries, and the preservation of its dead in the catacombs was uncertain; but even if only the skull of Tnepreez was left, or the bone of his little finger, or the dust of mummia into which he had crumbled, the men-at-arms were to fetch it carefully, guarding it like a holy relic.\n\n\"'Tis an errand for hyenas rather than warriors,\" grumbled Yanur in his black and spade-shaped beard. \"By the god Yululun, Keeper of the Tombs, I deem it an ill thing to disturb the peaceful dead. And truly it is not well for men to enter Chaon Gacca, where Death has made his capital, and has gathered all the ghouls to do him homage.\"\n\n\"The king should have sent his embalmers,\" opined Grotara. He was the youngest and hugest of the three, being taller by a full head than Yanur or Thirlain Ludoch; and like them, he was a veteran of savage wars and desperate perils.\n\n\"Yea, I said it was an errand for hyenas,\" rejoined Yanur. \"But the king knew well that there were no mortal beings in all Miraab, saving ourselves, who would dare to enter the accursed vaults of Chaon Gacca. Two centuries ago, King Mandis, wishing to retrieve the golden mirror of Queen Avaina for his favorite leman, commanded two of his bravos to descend within the vaults, where the mummy of Avaina sits enthroned in her separate tomb, holding the mirror in her withered hand....And the bravos went to Chaon Gacca...but they did not return; and King Mandis, being warned by a soothsayer, made no second attempt to procure the mirror, but contented his leman with another gift.\"\n\n\"Yanur, thy tales would gladden those who await the scything of the executioner,\" said Thirlain Ludoch, the oldest of the trio, whose brown beard was faded to a hempen hue by desert suns. \"But I chide thee not. It is common knowledge that the catacombs are ridden with worse hauntings than those of liches or phantoms. Strange devils came there long ago from the mad, unholy desert of Dloth; and I have heard it told that the kings forsook Chaon Gacca because of certain Shadows, that appeared at full noon in the palace-halls, with no visible form to cast them, and would not depart thereafter, being changeless amid all the changings of the light, and wholly undimmed by the exorcisms of priests and sorcerers. Men say that the flesh of any who dared to touch the Shadows, or to tread upon them, became black and putrid like the flesh of month-old corpses, all in a mere instant. Because of such testing, when one of the Shadows came and sat upon his throne, the right hand of King Agmeni rotted to the wrist, and fell away like the sloughing of a leper.... And after that, no man would dwell in Chaon Gacca.\"\n\n\"Verily, I have heard other stories,\" said Yanur. \"The town's abandonment was due mainly to the failure of the wells and cisterns, from which the water vanished following an earthquake that left the land riven with hell-deep chasms. The palace of the kings was sundered to its nethermost vault by one of the chasms; and King Agmeni was seized by a violent madness when he inhaled the infernal vapors issuing from the rent; nor was he ever wholly sane in his latter lifetime, after the quitting of Chaon Gacca and the rearing of Miraab.\"\n\n\"Now that is a tale that I can believe,\" said Grotara. \"And surely I must deem that Famorgh has inherited the madness of his forefather, Agmeni. Methinks that the royal house of Tasuun rots and totters to its fall. Harlots and sorcerers swarm in the palace of Famorgh like charnelworms; and now, in this princess Lunalia of Xylac whom he has taken to wife, he has found a harlot and a witch in one. He has sent us on this errand at the prompting of Lunalia, who desires the mummy of Tnepreez for her own unhallowed purpose. Tnepreez, I have heard, was a great wizard in his time; and Lunalia would avail herself of the potent virtue of his bones and dust in the brewing of her philtres. Pah! I like not the task of such purveyance. There are mummies enow in Miraab for the making of potions to madden the Queen's lovers. Famorgh is utterly besotted and befooled.\"\n\n\"Beware,\" admonished Thirlain Ludoch, \"for Lunalia is a vampire who lusts ever for the young and strong...and thy turn may come next, O Grotara, if fortune brings us back alive from this enterprise. I have seen her watching thee.\"\n\n\"I would sooner mate with the wild lamia,\" protested Grotara in virtuous indignation.\n\n\"Thy aversion would help thee not,\" said Thirlain Ludoch. . . \"for I know others who have drunk the potions.... But we are now nearing the last wineshop in Miraab; and my throat is dusty beforehand with the very thought of this journey. I shall need a whole stoup of wine from Yoros to wash the dust away.\"\n\n\"Thou sayest sooth,\" agreed Yanur. \"Already, I have become dry as the mummy of Tnepreez. And thou, Grotara?\"\n\n\"I will quaff any drink, if it be not the philtre-brew of Queen Lunalia.\"\n\nMounted on swift, untiring dromedaries, and followed by a fourth camel bearing on its back a light wooden sarcophagus for the accommodation of King Tnepreez, the three henchmen had soon left behind them the bright and noisy streets of Miraab, and the fields of sesame, the crofts of apricot and pomegranate, lying for miles about the city. Before noon, they had parted from the route of caravans, and had taken a road that was seldom used by any but lions and jackals. However, the way to Chaon Gacca was plain, for the ruts of olden chariots were still deeply marked in the desert soil, where rain no longer fell at any season.\n\nOn the first night, they slept beneath the cold and crowding stars, and kept watch by turn lest a lion should come upon them unaware, or a viper should crawl among them for warmth. During the second day, they passed amid steepening hills and deep ravines that retarded their progress. Here there was no rustling of serpent or lizard, and naught but their own voices and the shuffling of the camels to break the silence that lay upon all things like a mute malediction. Sometimes, on the desiccating tors above them, against the darkly litten sky, they saw the boughs of century-withered cacti, or the boles of trees that immemorial fires had blasted.\n\nThe second sunset found them in sight of Chaon Gacca, rearing its dilapidated walls at a distance of less than four leagues in a broad open valley. Coming then to a wayside shrine of Yuckla, the small and grotesque god of laughter, whose influence was believed to be mainly benignant, they were glad to go no farther on that day, but took shelter in the crumbling shrine for fear of the ghouls and devils, who might dwell in such vicinage to those accursed ruins. They had brought with them from Miraab a wineskin filled with the fervent ruby wine of Yoros; and though the skin was now three-fourths empty, they poured a libation in the twilight on the broken altar, and prayed to Yuckla for such protection as he might give them against the demons of the night.\n\nThey slept on the worn and chilly flags about the altar, watching by turn, as before. Grotara, who kept the third watch, beheld at last the paling of the close-hung stars, and aroused his companions in a dawn that was like a sifting of ashes through the cinder-black darkness.\n\nAfter a scanty meal of figs and dried goat-flesh, they resumed their journey, guiding their camels down the valley, and weaving back and forth on the bouldered slopes when they came to abysmal rents in the earth and rock. Their approach to the ruins was rendered slow and tortuous by such divagations. The way was lined by the stocks of orchard trees that had perished long ago, and by cotes and granges where even the hyena no longer made his lair.\n\nBecause of their many detours, it was hard upon noon when they rode through the hollow-ringing streets of the city. Like ragged purple cloaks, the shadows of the ruining houses were drawn close to their walls and portals. Everywhere the havoc of earthquake was manifest, and the fissured avenues and mounded mansions served to verify the tales that Yanur had heard concerning the reason of the city's abandonment.\n\nThe palace of the kings, however, was still pre-eminent above the other buildings. A tumbled pile, it frowned in dark porphyry on a low acropolis amid the northern quarter. For the making of this acropolis, a hill of red syenite had been stripped of its covering soil in elder days, and had been hewn to sheer and rounding walls, circled by a road that wound slowly about it to the summit. Following this road, and nearing the portals of the courtyard, the henchmen of Famorgh came to a fissure that clove their path from wall to precipice, yawning far in the cliff. The chasm was less than a yard in width; but the dromedaries balked before it. The three dismounted; and, leaving the camels to await their return, they leapt lightly across the fissure. Grotara and Thirlain Ludoch carrying the sarcophagus, and Yanur bearing the wineskin, they passed beneath the shattered barbican.\n\nThe great courtyard was heavily strewn with the wreckage of once-lofty towers and balconies, over which the warriors climbed with much wariness, eyeing the shadows closely, and loosening their swords in the sheath, as if they were surmounting the barricades of a hidden foe. All three were startled by the pale and naked form of a colossean female, which they saw reclining on the blocks and rubble in a portico beyond the court. But, drawing nearer, they found that the shape was not that of a she-demon, as they had apprehended, but was merely a marble statue that had once stood like a caryatid among the mighty pillars.\n\nFollowing the directions given them by Famorgh, they entered the main hall. Here, beneath the chasmed and collapsing roof, they moved with the utmost caution, fearing that a light jar, a whisper, would bring the suspended ruin upon their heads like an avalanche. Overturned tripods of greening copper, tables and trivets of splintered ebony, and the shards of gayly painted porcelains, were mingled with the huge fragments of pedestals and fusts and entablatures; and upon a shivered dais of green, blood-spotted heliotrope, the tarnished silver throne of the kings careened amid the mutilated sphinxes, carved from jasper, that kept eternal guard beside it.\n\nAt the further end of the hall, they found an alcove, still unblocked by fallen debris, in which were the stairs that led downward to the catacombs. They paused briefly ere beginning their descent. Yanur applied himself without ceremony to the skin which he carried, and lightened it considerably before giving it into the hands of Thirlain Ludoch, who had marked his potations, with solicitude. Thirlain Ludoch and Grotara drank the remainder of the vintage between them; and the latter did not grumble at the thick lees which fell to his lot. Thus replenished, they lit three torches of pitchy terebinth, which they had brought along in the sarcophagus. Yanur led the way, daring the tenebrous depths with drawn sword, and a torch flaming smokily in his left hand. His companions followed, bearing the sarcophagus, in which, by raising the hinged lid slightly, they had socketed the other torches. The potent wine of Yoros mounted with them, driving away their shadowy fears and apprehensions; but all three were seasoned drinkers, and they moved with great care and circumspection, and did not stumble on the dim, uncertain steps.\n\nPassing through a series of wine-cellars, full of cracked and sharded jars, they came at last, after many zigzag plungings of the stairs, to a vast corridor hewn in the nether syenite, below the level of the city streets. It stretched before them through illimitable gloom, its walls unshattered, and its roof admitting no crevice-filtered ray. It seemed that they had entered some impregnable citadel of the dead, On the right hand were the tombs of the elder kings; on the left, were the sepulchers of the queens; and lateral passages led to a world of subsidiary vaults, reserved for other members of the royal family. At the further end of the main hall, they would find the burial-chamber of Tnepreez.\n\nYanur, following the right-hand wall, soon came to the first tomb. According to custom, its portals were open, and were lower than a man's stature, so that all who entered must bow in humbleness to death. Yanur held his torch to the lintel, and read stumblingly the legend graven in the stone, which told that the vault was that of King Acharnil, father of Agmeni.\n\n\"Verily,\" he said, \"we shall find nothing here, other than the harmless dead.\" Then, the wine he had drunk impelling him to a sort of bravado, he stooped before the portals and thrust his flickering flambeau into the tomb of Acharnil.\n\nSurprised, he swore a loud and soldierly oath, that made the others drop their burden and crowd behind him. Peering into the square, concamerated chamber, which had a kingly spaciousness, they saw that it was unoccupied by any visible tenant. The tall chair of mystically graven gold and ebony, in which the mummy should have sat crowned and robed as in life, was addorsed against the farther wall on a low dais. In it, there lay an empty robe of sable and carmine, and a miter-shaped crown of silver set with black sapphires, as if the dead king had doffed them and had gone away!\n\nStartled, with the wine dying swiftly in their brains, the warriors felt the crawling chill of an unknown mystery. Yanur, however, steeled himself to enter the vault. He examined the shadowy corners, he lifted and shook the raiment of Achamil, but found no clue to the riddle of the mummy's disappearance. The tomb was clean of dust, and there was no visible sign nor faintest odor of mortal decay.\n\nYanur rejoined his comrades, and the three eyed each other in eerie consternation. They resumed their exploring of the hall; and Yanur, as he came to the doorway of each tomb, paused before it and thrust his flambeau into the wavering murk, only to discover a vacant throne, and the cast-off regalia of royalty.\n\nThere was, it seemed, no reasonable explanation for the vanishing of the mummies, in whose preservation the powerful spices of the Orient had been employed, together with natron, rendering them virtually incorruptible. From the circumstances, it did not appear that they had been removed by human robbers, who would hardly have left behind the precious jewels, fabrics and metals; and it was even more unlikely that they had been devoured by animals: for in that case the bones would have remained, and the vestments would have been torn and disordered. The mythic terrors of Chaon Gacca began to assume a darker imminence; and the seekers peered and listened fearfully as they went on in the hushed sepulchral hall.\n\nPresently, after they had verified the vacancy of more than a dozen tombs, they saw the glimmering of several steely objects before them on the floor of the corridor. These, on investigation, proved to be two swords, two helmets and cuirasses of a slightly antiquated type, such as had formerly been worn by the warriors of Tasuun. They might well have belonged to the unreturning braves sent by King Mandis to retrieve the mirror of Avaina.\n\nYanur, Grotara and Thirlain Ludoch, viewing these sinister relics, were seized by an almost frantic desire to accomplish their errand and regain the sunlight. They hurried on, no longer pausing to inspect the separate tombs, and debating, as they went, the curious problem that would be presented if the mummy sought by Famorgh and Lunalia should have vanished like the others. The king had commanded them to fetch the remains of Tnepreez; and they knew that no excuse or explanation of their failure to do this would be accepted. Under such circumstances, their return to Miraab would be inadvisable; and the only safety would lie in flight beyond the northern desert, along the route of caravans to Zul-Bha-Sair or Xylac.\n\nIt seemed that they traversed an enormous distance, among the more ancient vaults. Here the formation of the stone was softer and more friable, and the earthquake had wrought considerable damage. The floor was littered with detritus, the sides and roof were full of fractures, and some of the chambers had partially fallen in, so that their vacancy was revealed to the casual peering of Yanur and his companions.\n\nNearing the hall's end, they were confronted by a chasm, dividing both floor and roof, and splitting the sill and lintel of the last chamber. The gulf was about four feet wide, and the torch of Yanur could not disclose its bottom. He found the name of Tnepreez on the lintel, whose antique inscription, telling the deeds and titles of the king, had been sundered in twain by the cataclysm. Then, walking on a narrow ledge, he entered the vault. Grotara and Thirlain Ludoch crowded behind him, leaving the sarcophagus in the hall.\n\nThe sepulchral throne of Tnepreez, overturned and broken, was lying across the fissure that had rifted the whole tomb from side to side. There was no trace of the mummy, which, from the chair's inverted position, had doubtless fallen into those yawning depths in the hour of its overthrow.\n\nBefore the seekers could voice their disappointment and their dismay, the silence about them was broken by a dull rumbling as of distant thunder. The stone trembled beneath their feet, the walls shook and wavered, and the rumbling noise, in long, shuddering undulations, grew louder and more ominous. The solid floor appeared to rise and flow with a continuous sickening motion; and then, as they turned to flee, it seemed that the universe came down upon them in a roaring deluge of night and ruin.\n\nGrotara, wakening in darkness, was aware of an agonizing burden, as if some monumental shaft were builded on his crushed feet and lower legs. His head throbbed and ached as if from the stroke of a stunning mace. He found that his arms and body were free; but the pain in his extremities became insufferable, causing him to swoon anew, when he tried to drag them from beneath their encumbrance.\n\nTerror closed upon him like the clutch of ghoulish fingers, as he realized his situation. An earthquake, such as had caused the abandonment of Chaon Gacca, had occurred; and he and his fellows were entombed in the catacombs. He called aloud, repeating the names of Yanur and Thirlain Ludoch many times; but there was no groan nor rustle to assure him that they still lived.\n\nReaching out with his right hand, he encountered numerous pieces of rubble. Slewing himself toward them, he found several bouldersized fragments of stone, and among them a smooth and roundish thing, with a sharp ridge in the center, which he knew for the crested helmet worn by one of his companions. Even with the most painful striving, he could reach no further, and was unable to identify the owner. The metal was heavily dented, and the comb was bent as if by the impact of some ponderous mass.\n\nIn spite of his predicament, the fierce nature of Grotara refused to yield itself to despair. He drew himself to a sitting position, and, doubling forward, he contrived to reach the enormous block that had fallen across his nether limbs. He pushed against it with herculean effort, raging like a trapped lion, but the mass was immovable. For hours, it seemed, he strove as if with some monstrous cacodemon. His frenzy was calmed only by exhaustion. He lay back at length; and the darkness weighed upon him like a live thing, and seemed to gnaw him with fangs of pain and horror.\n\nDelirium hovered near, and he thought that he heard a dim and hideous humming, far below in the stony bowels of the earth. The noise grew louder, as if ascending from a riven hell. He became aware of a wan, unreal light that wavered above him, disclosing in doubtful glimpses the shattered roof. The light strengthened; and lifting himself a little, he saw that it poured from the earthquake chasm in the floor.\n\nIt was a light such as he had never seen: a livid luster, that was not the reflection of lamp or torch or firebrand. Somehow, as if the senses of hearing and sight were confused, he identified it with the hideous humming.\n\nLike a sourceless dawn, the luminosity crept upon the ruin wrought by the temblor. Grotara saw that the whole entrance of the tomb, and much of its concameration, had caved in. A fragment, striking him on the head, had knocked him senseless; and a huge section of the roof had fallen across his extremities.\n\nThe bodies of Thirlain Ludoch and Yanur were lying close to the broadened chasm. Both, he felt sure, were dead. The grizzled beard of Thirlain Ludoch was dark and stiff with blood that had run down from the crushed cranium; and Yanur was half-buried in a pile of blocks and detritus, from which his torso and left arm were emergent. His torch had burned itself out in his stiffly clutching fingers, as if in a blackened socket.\n\nAll this Grotara noted in a vague dream-like manner. Then he perceived the real source of the strange illumination. A coldly shining, hueless globe, round as a puffball and large as a human head, had risen from the fissure and was hovering above it like a mimic moon. The thing oscillated with a slight but ceaseless vibratory motion. From it, as if caused by this vibration, the heavy humming poured, and the light fell in ever-trembling waves.\n\nA dim awe was upon Grotara; but he felt no terror. It seemed that the light and sound were woven upon his senses like some Lethean spell. Rigid he sat, forgetful of his pain and despair, while the globe hovered for a few instants above the chasm, and then floated slowly and horizontally, till it hung directly over the upturned features of Yanur.\n\nWith the same deliberate slowness, the same ceaseless oscillation, it descended upon the face and neck of the dead man, which appeared to melt away like tallow as the globe settled lower and lower. The humming deepened, the globe flamed with an eerie luster, and its death-like pallor was mottled with impure iris. It swelled and bloated obscenely, while the whole head of the warrior shrank within the helmet, and the plates of his cuirass fell in as if the very torso were shrivelling beneath them.\n\nGrotara's eyes beheld the horrific vision clearly; but his brain was numbed as if by a merciful hemlock. It was hard to remember, hard to think . . . but somehow he recalled the empty tombs, the ownerless crowns and vestments. The enigma of the missing mummies, over which he and his companions had puzzled vainly, was now resolved. But the thing that battened upon Yanur was beyond all mortal knowledge or surmise. It was some ghoulish denizen of a nether world, set free by the demons of earthquake.\n\nNow, in the catalepsy that thralled him, he saw the gradual settling of the piled débris in which the legs and hips of Yanur were inhumed. The helmet and body-mail were like empty shards, the outflung arm had withered, had shortened, and the very bones were dwindling away, appearing to melt and liquefy. The globe had grown enormous. It was flushed with unclean ruby, like a vampire moon. From it, there issued palpable ropes and filaments, pearly, shuddering into strange colors, that appeared to fasten themselves to the ruined floor and walls and roof, like the weaving of a spider. Thickly and more thickly they multiplied, forming a curtain between Grotara and the chasm, and falling upon Thirlain Ludoch and himself, till he saw the sanguine burning of the globe as through arabesques of baleful opal.\n\nNow the web had filled the entire tomb. It ran and glistened with a hundred changing hues, it dripped with glories drawn from the spectrum of dissolution. It bloomed with ghostly blossoms, and foliages that grew and faded as if by necromancy. The eyes of Grotara were blinded; more and more he was meshed in the weird web. Unearthly, chill as the fingers of death, its gossamers clung and quivered upon his face and hands.\n\nHe could not tell the duration of the weaving, the term of his enthralment. Dimly, at last, he beheld the thinning of the luminous threads, the retraction of the trembling arabesques. The globe, a thing of evil beauty, alive and aware in some holocryptic fashion, had risen now from the empty armor of Yanur. Diminishing to its former size, and putting off its colors of blood and opal, it hung for a little above the chasm. Grotara felt that it was watching him... was watching Thirlain Ludoch. Then, like a satellite of the nether caverns, it fell slowly into the fissure, and the light faded from the tomb and left Grotara in deepening darkness.\n\nAfter that, there were ages of fever, thirst and madness, of torment and slumber, and recurrent strugglings against the massive block that held him prisoner. He babbled insanely, he howled like a wolf; or, lying supine and silent, he heard the multitudinous, muttering voices of ghouls that conspired against him. Gangrening swiftly, his crushed extremities seemed to throb like those of a Titan. He drew his sword with the strength of delirium, and endeavored to saw himself free at the shins, only to swoon from loss of blood.\n\nAwakening feebly, and scarce able to lift his head, he saw that the light had returned, and heard once more the incessant vibrant humming that filled the vault. His mind was clear, and a weak terror stirred within him: for he knew that the Weaver had risen again from the chasm...and knew the reason of its coming.\n\nHe turned his head laboriously, and watched the glowing ball as it hung and oscillated, and then came down in leisurely descent on the face of Thirlain Ludoch. Again he saw it bloat obscenely, like a bloodflushed moon, fed with the wasting of the old warrior's body. Again, with dazzled eyes, he beheld the weaving of the web of impure iris, patterned with deathly splendor, veiling the ruinous catacomb with its weird illusions, Again, like a dying beetle, he was meshed in its chill, unearthly strands; and its necromantic flowers, blooming and perishing, latticed the void air above him. But, ere the retracting of the web, his delirium came upon him and brought a demon-peopled darkness; and the Weaver finished its toil unseen, and returned unheeded to the chasm.\n\nHe tossed in the hells of fever, or lay at the black, undivined nadir of oblivion. But death tarried, still aloof; and he lived on by sheer virtue of his youth and giant strength. Once more, toward the end, his senses cleared, and he saw for the third time the unholy light and heard again the odious humming. The Weaver was poised above him, pale, shining and vibrant...and he knew that it was waiting for him to die.\n\nLifting his sword with weak fingers, he sought to drive it away. But the thing hovered, alert and vigilant, beyond his reach; and he thought that it watched him like a vulture. The sword dropped from his hand. The luminous horror did not depart. It drew nearer, like an eyeless, pertinacious face; and it seemed to follow him, swooping through the ultimate night as he fell deathward.\n\nWith none to behold the glory of its weaving, with darkness before and after, the Weaver spun its final web in the tomb of Tnepreez.",
        "content_cn": "塔苏恩第五十九代君主法莫尔格的旨意详尽而严苛，违抗者将遭受比死亡更可怖的惩罚。黎明时分，国王最精锐的三名侍卫亚努尔、格罗塔拉与瑟兰·卢多克从米拉布王宫策马而出，彼此用干涩的玩笑讨论着究竟服从还是抗命会招致更可怕的灾祸。\n\n他们接到的任务既离奇又令人作呕——前往米拉布以北九十英里沙漠丘陵间的废弃王都查昂加卡，深入倾颓宫殿下的墓穴，将王朝始祖特内普里兹王的木乃伊残骸带回。这座死城已数世纪无人踏足，地窖中的遗体能保存多少尚属未知。但即便只剩头骨、小指骨或风化的裹尸布，他们也要像对待圣物般谨慎运送。\n\n\"这该让鬣狗而非战士执行，\"亚努尔在铁铲状的黑须间嘟囔，\"以陵墓守护神尤卢伦之名，惊扰安眠的亡者绝非吉兆。凡人踏入死亡之都查昂加卡本就不智，那里盘踞着朝拜死神的食尸鬼众。\"\n\n\"国王该派防腐师来，\"体格最魁梧的格罗塔拉附和。他曾亲历无数腥风血雨，比同伴高出整整一头。\n\n\"两百年前，曼迪斯王为宠妾派遣勇士盗取阿瓦娜王后的金镜，\"亚努尔继续道，\"那具木乃伊至今仍握宝镜端坐墓中...可两名勇士再未归来。占卜师警告后，曼迪斯王便放弃了。\"\n\n\"你的故事真适合刽子手听众，\"被沙漠烈日晒褪胡须的瑟兰·卢多克打断，\"但地窖确实游荡着比亡灵更可怕的存在。传说德洛思荒原的恶魔盘踞此地，正午时分的宫墙会浮现无源之影——触碰者血肉即刻腐坏。阿格梅尼王就因王座上的阴影烂掉了右手...\"\n\n\"我倒听过不同说法，\"亚努尔反驳，\"地震撕裂地层后井水枯竭，阿格梅尼王吸入裂缝涌出的毒雾发狂，从此再未清醒。\"\n\n格罗塔拉突然压低声音：\"法莫尔格必是继承了先祖的疯病。如今王宫挤满娼妓术士，新娶的希拉克公主卢娜莉娅更兼二者——定是她蛊惑国王索要始祖遗骸施法。特内普里兹生前就是强大巫师...\"\n\n\"当心，\"瑟兰警告，\"那吸血鬼尤爱壮年男子...格罗塔拉，归程后便轮到你了。\"见对方怒斥宁可与拉弥亚交合，老侍卫冷笑：\"迷情药可不管意愿。\"\n\n途经最后一家酒馆时，瑟兰抖落满喉沙尘：\"得用整壶约罗斯红酒浇灌。\"亚努尔附和渴如干尸，格罗塔拉则发誓绝不碰王后的春药。\n\n三人骑着迅捷骆驼，载着轻便木棺离开米拉布。正午时分转向狮豹横行的荒径，干涸战车辙印在无雨沙漠中清晰可辨。首夜他们在寒星下轮值守夜，次日穿越峡谷时，唯闻蹄声回荡在枯死千年的仙人掌阴影间。\n\n第二日黄昏，残破城墙终于浮现。他们在笑神尤克拉的废祠歇脚，向祭坛泼洒红酒祈求庇护。格罗塔拉守夜时，目睹灰烬般的晨光滤过黑暗。\n\n穿越地震裂缝遍布的街道，王宫黑斑岩建筑仍俯视着红砂岩垒成的卫城。在裂谷前弃骆驼跃过，三人抬棺进入庭院。一具裸女巨像令他们悚然，近看方知是倾颓的承柱石雕。\n\n主厅穹顶摇摇欲坠，翻倒的铜鼎与碧玉狮身像间，斑驳银王座斜插在血纹绿岩台基上。找到通往地窖的阶梯后，他们痛饮烈酒壮胆，点燃树脂火炬深入地下。\n\n穿过酒窖迷宮，终于抵达凿入基岩的墓道。右侧列王陵寝门户低矮，入者皆需向死亡折腰。亚努尔探查首座墓室时突然咒骂——本该端坐金椅的木乃伊消失无踪，仅剩缀满黑蓝宝石的冠冕与衣袍。每座陵墓皆然，防腐完好的遗骸集体蒸发，珍宝却完好无损。\n\n三人毛骨悚然。既无盗掘痕迹，亦非野兽所为。查昂加卡传说中的恐怖正化作实质，在死寂墓道中向他们步步紧逼。\n\n在查验了十几座空无一物的墓穴后，他们突然看见走廊地面上闪烁着几处金属寒光。走近细看，那是两柄长剑、两顶头盔与两副略显古旧的胸甲——正是塔苏恩武士曾经的装束。这些遗物极可能属于曼迪斯王派去寻回阿瓦伊娜之镜却未能归来的勇士们。\n\n亚努尔、格罗塔拉与瑟兰·卢多克凝视着这些不祥的遗物，突然被一阵近乎癫狂的冲动攫住，只想速速完成任务重返阳光之下。他们不再驻足查看沿途墓穴，边疾行边讨论着那个诡异难题：若法莫格与露娜莉亚寻找的木乃伊也像其他墓主般消失无踪，他们该如何复命？国王勒令他们带回特内普里兹的遗骸，而任何辩解都难逃严惩。此刻返回米拉布无异于自寻死路，唯有穿越北方荒漠，沿着商队路线逃往祖尔-巴-赛尔或赛拉克方能活命。\n\n在年代更为久远的墓区中，他们仿佛跋涉了无尽距离。这里的石质松软易碎，地震造成的破坏触目惊心。地面散落着碎石，四壁与穹顶布满裂痕，某些墓室已部分坍塌，使得亚努尔等人稍加窥探便能确认其内的空荡。\n\n临近墓厅尽头时，一道撕裂地面与穹顶的深渊横亘眼前，连最后墓室的门楣也被劈成两半。这道四英尺宽的鸿沟深不见底，亚努尔火把的光亮无法照及其底。他在断裂的门楣上辨认出特内普里兹的名字——记载这位君王生平功绩的古铭文已被灾变一分为二。他沿着狭窄岩脊进入墓室，格罗塔拉与瑟兰·卢多克紧随其后，将石棺留在厅中。\n\n特内普里兹那具墓室王座倾覆断裂，横亘在贯穿整座陵墓的裂隙之上。木乃伊已无迹可寻，从王座倒扣的姿态判断，它无疑在倾塌时坠入了那道可怖的深渊。\n\n未等寻宝者们发出失望的惊呼，远处雷鸣般的沉闷轰响便打破了寂静。脚下岩石开始震颤，墙壁摇晃战栗，那隆隆声带着令人毛骨悚然的波动愈发震耳欲聋。坚实的地面仿佛在病态的起伏中隆起，当他们转身逃命时，整座宇宙似乎都化作咆哮的黑暗洪流倾泻而下。\n\n格罗塔拉在黑暗中苏醒，剧痛从下肢传来，仿佛有通天石柱压在他粉碎的双足与小腿上。头颅的抽痛犹如遭受重锤击打。他发现双臂与躯干尚能活动，但试图挪开压在腿上的巨石时，撕心裂肺的疼痛立刻令他再度昏厥。\n\n当他认清处境时，恐惧如食尸鬼的利爪攫住心脏。导致超恩·加卡被遗弃的地震再度降临，他与同伴们被活埋于地下墓穴。他高声呼喊亚努尔与瑟兰·卢多克的名字，却得不到丝毫回应。\n\n右手摸索到无数碎石，他忍着剧痛转身，在几块巨岩般的碎块间触到一件光滑的圆形物体——中央凸起的棱线表明这是同伴的头盔。但任凭如何挣扎，他都无法确认主人身份。金属严重凹陷，盔顶装饰像是被万钧重物砸弯。\n\n格罗塔拉凶悍的天性拒绝向绝望屈服。他挣扎着坐起，弯腰去推压在腿上的巨石，如同困兽般发出狂怒的嘶吼。但巨石纹丝不动。数小时的抗争仿佛是与某种深渊恶魔的角力，直到精疲力竭才瘫倒在地。黑暗如活物般压来，用痛苦与恐怖的獠牙啃噬着他。\n\n谵妄渐近时，他听见地底深处传来模糊而骇人的嗡鸣。那声音越来越响，仿佛正从撕裂的地狱中升起。一道惨白虚幻的光晕在他头顶摇曳，映出破碎的穹顶。光芒渐强，他微微抬头，发现光源来自地面的地震裂隙。\n\n那是他从未见过的光：一种不似任何灯烛火焰的铅灰色冷焰。不知为何，听觉与视觉在此刻混淆，他将这光芒与那可憎的嗡鸣视为一体。\n\n如同无源之晨光，这诡异的辉晕缓缓爬过地震造成的废墟。格罗塔拉看见墓室入口已完全塌陷，自己是被落石击晕的。一块穹顶巨岩压住了他的下肢。\n\n瑟兰·卢多克与亚努尔的尸体横陈在拓宽的裂隙旁。前者花白的胡须沾满颅骨碎裂流出的黑血；后者半埋在碎石堆中，僵直的手指仍握着燃尽的火把，如同焦黑的灯座。\n\n这一切在格罗塔拉朦胧的视野中如梦似幻。接着他发现了光芒的真正源头：一个如马勃菌般浑圆、人头大小的无色调光球正从裂隙升起，如同微型月亮般悬浮其上。它持续进行着细微的振动，正是这振动释放出沉重的嗡鸣，光芒也随之如涟漪般颤抖。\n\n某种晦暗的敬畏笼罩着格罗塔拉，却无半分恐惧。光与声仿佛勒忒河畔的咒语般麻痹了他的感官。他僵坐着忘却痛苦，看着光球在裂隙上空徘徊片刻后，缓缓飘向亚努尔仰面的尸骸。\n\n带着同样刻意的迟缓与振动，光球降落在死者面部。当它逐渐下移时，尸体的肌肤如蜡油般消融。嗡鸣变得低沉，光球迸发出妖异的虹彩，死白色的表面浮现污浊的斑纹。它邪恶地膨胀起来，武士的头颅却在头盔中萎缩，胸甲下的躯干如同干瘪的果壳。\n\n格罗塔拉的双眼清晰见证着这恐怖景象，意识却如服下毒芹般麻木。记忆与思维变得困难……但他突然想起那些空墓穴，那些无主的冠冕与衣袍。曾经困扰他们的木乃伊失踪之谜，此刻有了答案。但蚕食亚努尔的怪物远超凡人认知——这是被地震恶魔释放出的地底食尸者。\n\n在僵直状态中，他看见掩埋亚努尔下肢的碎石堆逐渐沉降。头盔与铠甲已成空壳，伸出的手臂枯萎缩短，连骨骼都在消融。光球已膨胀到骇人尺寸，泛着吸血鬼月亮般的污浊红光。无数珍珠色的丝索从球体伸出，颤动着变幻色彩，如同蛛网般粘附在废墟各处。\n\n很快整个墓室都布满这张怪网。变幻的虹光在丝线上流淌，仿佛汲取了解体的光谱。幽灵般的花叶在网中绽放又凋零。格罗塔拉逐渐被这张阴冷非尘世的罗网包裹，诡异的丝絮如死神手指般黏附在他皮肤上。\n\n不知过了多久，发光的丝线开始稀疏消退。那邪恶而美丽的光球——某种全知全觉的可怖存在——从空铠甲中升起。它缩小回原有尺寸，褪去血色与虹彩，在裂隙上空短暂停留。格罗塔拉感到它在注视自己……也在注视瑟兰·卢多克。随后它如地底世界的卫星般缓缓沉入裂隙，黑暗再度吞噬墓室。\n\n接下来是漫长的煎熬：高烧、干渴、疯癫，与巨石的徒劳抗争。他时而如狼嚎叫，时而听见食尸鬼的窃窃私语。坏死的下肢如泰坦巨人般搏动。在谵妄中他抽剑试图斩断双腿，却因失血而昏迷。\n\n当他虚弱地苏醒时，怪光再度降临，嗡鸣响彻墓室。清醒的意识带来微弱的恐惧：他知道编织者已重返人间……也明白它为何而来。\n\n他艰难转头，看着发光球体悬停振动，而后缓缓降落在瑟兰·卢多克脸上。再次目睹它如充血月亮般膨胀，吸食老武士的躯体。妖异的虹网再度织就，用死亡的华美遮蔽废墟。他如垂死甲虫被阴冷的异界丝线缠绕，幻术之花在头顶开谢。但在蛛网消退前，谵妄的黑夜已携群魔降临，编织者完成了不被见证的收割。\n\n他在高热地狱中翻滚，或沉沦于虚无的黑暗深渊。但死亡迟迟未至，青年的顽强生命力延续着煎熬。最终他的意识第三次清醒，看见亵渎的光芒，听见可憎的嗡鸣。编织者在他上方振动，苍白而警觉……它正等待他的死亡。\n\n他虚弱地举剑驱赶，光球却如秃鹫般盘旋不退。当利剑脱手时，那无眼的执着面孔愈发逼近，随他一同坠向死亡的永夜。\n\n在没有见证者的黑暗中，编织者在特内普里兹的陵墓里完成了最后的织造。"

        "content": "\n\nEvening had come from the desert into Faraad, bringing the last stragglers of caravans. In a wine-shop near the northern gate, many traveling merchants from outer lands, parched and weary, were re-freshing themselves with the famed vintages of Yoros. To divert them from their fatigue, a story-teller spoke amid the clinking of the wine-cups:\n\n\"Great was Ossaru, being both king and wizard. He ruled over half the continent of Zothique. His armies were like the rolling sands, blown by the simoom. He commanded the genii of storm and of dark-ness, he called down the spirits of the sun. Men knew his wizardry as the green cedars know the blasting of levin.\n\n\"Half immortal, he lived from age to age, waxing in his wisdom and power till the end. Thasaidon, black god of evil, prospered his every spell and enterprise. And during his latter years he was companioned by the monster Nioth Korghai, who came down to Earth from an alien world, riding a fire-maned comet.\n\n\"Ossaru, by his skill in astrology, had foreseen the coming of Nioth Korghai. Alone, he went forth into the desert to await the monster. in many lands people saw the falling of the comet, like a sun that came down by night upon the waste; but only King Ossaru beheld the arrival of Nioth Korghai. He returned in the black, moonless hours before dawn when all men slept, bringing the strange monster to his palace, and housing him in a vault beneath the throne-room, which he had prepared for Nioth Korghai's abode.\n\n\"Dwelling always thereafter in the vault, the monster remained unknown and unbeheld. It was said that he gave advice to Ossaru, and instructed him in the lore of the outer planets. At certain periods of the stars, women and young warriors were sent down as a sacrifice to Nioth Korghai; and these returned never to give account of that which they had seen. None could surmise his aspect; but all who entered the palace heard ever in the vault beneath a muffled noise as of slow beaten drums, and a regurgitation such as would be made by an un-derground fountain; and sometimes men heard an evil cackling as of a mad cockatrice.\n\n\"For many years King Ossaru was served by Nioth Korghai, and gave service to the monster in return. Then Nioth Korghai sickened with a strange malady, and men heard no more the cackling in the sunken vault; and the noises of drums and fountain-mouths grew fainter, and ceased. The spells of the wizard king were powerless to avert his death; but when the monster had died, Ossaru surrounded his body with a double zone of enchantment, circle by circle, and closed the vault. And later, when Ossaru died, the vault was opened from above, and the king's mummy was lowered therein by his slaves, to repose forever beside that which remained of Nioth Korghai.\n\n\"Cycles have gone by since then; and Ossaru is but a name on the lips of story-tellers. Lost now is the palace wherein he dwelt, and the city thereabout, some saying that it stood in Yoros, and some, in the empire of Cincor, where Yethlyreom was later built by the Nimboth dynasty. And this alone is certain, that somewhere still, in the sealed tomb, the alien monster abides in death, together with King Ossaru. And about them still is the inner circle of Ossaru's enchantment, ren-dering their bodies incorruptible throughout all the decay of cities and kingdoms; and around this is another circle, guarding against all intru-sion; since he who enters there by the tomb's door will die instantly and will putrefy in the moment of death, falling to dusty corruption ere he strike the ground.\n\n\"Such is the legend of Ossaru and Nioth Korghai. No man has ever found their tomb; but the wizard Namirrha, prophesying darkly, foretold many ages ago that certain travelers, passing through the desert, would some day come upon it unaware. And he said that these travel-ers, descending into the tomb by another way than the door, would behold a strange prodigy. And he spoke not concerning the nature of the prodigy, but said only that Nioth Korghai, being a creature from some far world, was obedient to alien laws in death as in life. And of that which Namirrha meant, no man has yet guessed the secret.\"\n\nThe brothers Milab and Marabac, who were jewel-merchants from Ustaim, had listened raptly to the storyteller.\n\n\"Now truly this is a strange tale,\" said Milab. \"However, as all men know, there were great wizards in the olden days, workers of deep enchantment and wonder; and also there were true prophets. And the sands of Zothique are full of lost tombs and cities.\"\n\n\"It is a good story,\" said Marabac, \"but it lacks an ending. Prithee, O teller of tales, canst tell us no more than this? Was there no treasure of precious metals and jewels entombed with the monster and the king? I have seen sepulchers where the dead were walled with gold ingots, arid sarcophagi that poured forth rubies like the gouted blood of vampires.\"\n\n\"I relate the legend as my fathers told it,\" affirmed the story-teller. \"They who are destined to find the tomb must tell the rest — if haply they return from the finding.\"\n\nMilab and Marabac had traded their store of uncut jewels, of carver, talismans and small jasper and carnelian idols, making a good profit in Faraad. Now, laden with rosy and purple-black pearls from the south-ern gulfs, and the black sapphires and winy garnets of Yoros, they were returning northward toward Tasuun with a company of other merchants on the long, circuitous journey to Ustaim by the orient sea.\n\nThe way had led through a dying land. Now, as the caravan ap-proached the borders of Yoros, the desert began to assume a profounder desolation. The hills were dark and lean, like recumbent mummies of giants. Dry water-ways ran down to lake-bottoms leprous with salt. Billows of grey sand were driven high on the crumbling cliffs, where gentle waters had once rippled. Columns of dust arose and went by like fugitive phantoms. Over all, the sun was a monstrous ember in a charred heaven.\n\nInto this waste, which was seemingly unpeopled and void of life, the caravan went warily. Urging their camels to a swift trot in the narrow, deep-walled ravines, the merchants made ready their spears and claymores and scanned the barren ridges with anxious eyes. For here, in hidden caves, there lurked a wild and half-bestial people, known as the Ghorii. Akin to the ghouls and jackals, they were eaters of carrion; and also they were anthropophagi, subsisting by preference on the bodies of travelers, and drinking their blood in lieu of water or wine. They were dreaded by all who had occasion to journey between Yoros and Tasuun.\n\nThe sun climbed to its meridian, searching with ruthless beams the nethermost umbrage of the strait, deep defiles. The fine ash-light sand was no longer stirred by any puff of wind. No lizards lifted or scurried on the rocks.\n\nNow the road ran downward, following the course of some olden stream between acclivitous banks. Here, in lieu of former pools, there were pits of sand dammed up by riffles or boulders, in which the cam-els floundered knee-deep. And here, without the least warning, in a turn of the sinuous bed, the gully swarmed and seethed with the hid-eous earth-brown bodies of the Ghorii, who appeared instantaneously on all sides, leaping wolfishly from the rocky slopes or flinging themselves like panthers from the high ledges.\n\nThese ghoulish apparitions were unspeakably ferocious and agile. Uttering no sound, other than a sort of hoarse coughing and spitting, and armed only with their double rows of pointed teeth and their sickle—like talons, they poured over the caravan in a climbing wave. It seemed that there were scores of them to each man and camel. Several of the dromedaries were thrown to earth at once, with the Ghorii gnawing their legs and haunches and chines, or hanging dog-wise at their throats. They and their drivers were buried from sight by the ravenous mon-sters, who began to devour them immediately. Boxes of jewels and bales of rich fabrics were tom open in the melee, jasper and onyx idols were strewn ignominiously in the dust, pearls and rubies, unheeded, lay weltering in puddled blood; for these things were of no value to the Ghorii.\n\nMilab and Marabac, as it happened, were riding at the rear. They had lagged behind, somewhat against their will, since the camel ridden by Milab had gone lame from a stone-bruise; and thus, by good for-tune, they evaded the ghoulish onset. Pausing aghast, they beheld the fate of their companions, whose resistance was overcome with horrible quickness. The Ghorii, however, did not perceive Milab and Marabac, being wholly intent on devouring the camels and merchants they had dragged down, as well as those members of their own band that were wounded by the swords and lances of the travelers.\n\nThe two brothers, levelling their spears, would have ridden for-ward to perish bravely and uselessly with their fellows. But, terrified by the hideous tumult, by the odor of blood and the hyena-like scent of the Ghorii, their dromedaries balked and bolted, carrying them back along the route into Yoros.\n\nDuring this unpremeditated flight they soon saw another band of the Ghorii, who had appeared far off on the southern slopes and were running to intercept them. To avoid this new peril Milab and Marabac turned their camels into a side ravine. Traveling slowly because of the lameness of Milab's dromedary, and thinking to find the swift Ghorii on their heels at any moment, they went eastward for many miles with the sun lowering behind them, and came at mid-afternoon to the low and rainless water-shed of that immemorial region.\n\nHere they looked out over a sunken plain, wrinkled and eroded, where the white walls and domes of some inappelable city gleamed. It appeared to Milab and Marabac that the city was only a few leagues away. Deeming they had sighted some hidden town of the outer sands, and hopeful now of escaping their pursuers, they began the descent of the long slope toward the plain.\n\nFor two days, on a powdery terrain that was like the bituminous dust of mummies, they traveled toward the ever-receding domes that had seemed so near. Their plight became desperate; for between them they possessed only a handful of dried apricots and a water-bag that was three-fourths empty. Their provisions, together with their stock of jewels and carvings, had been lost with the pack-dromedaries of the caravan. Apparently there was no pursuit from the Ghorii; but about them there gathered the red demons of thirst, the black demons of hunger. On the second morning Milab's camel refused to rise and would not respond either to the cursing of its master or the prodding of his spear. Thereafter, the two shared the remaining camel, riding together or by turns.\n\nOften they lost sight of the gleaming city, which appeared and disappeared like a mirage. But an hour before sunset, on the second day, they followed the far-thrown shadows of broken obelisks and crum-bling watch-towers into the olden streets.\n\nThe place had once been a metropolis; but now many of its lordly mansions were scattered shards or heaps of downfallen blocks. Great dunes of sand had poured in through proud triumphal arches, had filled the pavements and courtyards. Lurching with exhaustion, and sick at heart with the failure of their hope, Milab and Marabac went on, searching everywhere for some well or cistern that the long desert years had haply spared.\n\nIn the city's heart, where the walls of temples and lofty buildings of state still served as a barrier to the engulfing sand, they found the ruins of an old aqueduct, leading to cisterns dry as furnaces. There were dust-choked fountains in the market places; but nowhere was there anything to betoken the presence of water.\n\nWandering hopelessly on, they came to the ruins of a huge edifice which, it appeared, had been the palace of some forgotten monarch. The mighty walls, defying the erosion of ages, were still extant. The portals, guarded on either hand by green brazen images of mythic he-roes, still frowned with unbroken arches. Mounting the marble steps, the jewelers entered a vast, roofless hall where cyclopean columns towered as if to bear up the desert sky.\n\nThe broad pavement flags were mounded with debris of arches and architraves and pilasters. At the hall's far extreme there was a dais of black-veined marble on which, presumably, a royal throne had once reared. Nearing the dais, Milab and Marabac both heard a low and indistinct gurgling as of some hidden stream or fountain, that appeared to rise from underground depths below the palace pavement.\n\nEagerly trying to locate the source of the sound, they climbed the dais. Here a huge block had fallen from the wall above, perhaps re-cently and the marble had cracked beneath its weight, and a portion of the dais had broken through into some underlying vault, leaving a dark and jagged aperture. It was from this opening that the water-like regurgitation rose, incessant and regular as the beating of a pulse.\n\nThe jewelers leaned above the pit, and peered down into webby darkness shot with a doubtful glimmering that came from an indis-cernible source. They could see nothing. A dank and musty odor touched their nostrils, like the breath of some long-sealed reservoir. It seemed to them that the steady fountain-like noise was only a few feet below in the shadows, a little to one side of the opening.\n\nNeither of them could determine the depth of the vault. After a brief consultation they returned to their camel, which was waiting stol-idly at the palace entrance; and removing the camel's harness they knot-ted the long reins and leather body-bands into a single thong that would serve them in lieu of rope. Going back to the dais, they secured one end of this thong to the fallen block, and lowered the other into the dark pit.\n\nMilab descended hand over hand into the depths for ten or twelve feet before his toes encountered a solid surface. Stiff gripping the thong cautiously, he found himself on a level floor of stone. The day was fast waning beyond the palace walls; but a wan glimmer was afforded by the hole in the pavement above; and the outlines of a half-open door, sagging at a ruinous angle, were revealed at one side by the feeble twilight that entered the vault from unknown crypts or stairs beyond.\n\nWhile Marabac came nimbly down to join him, Milab peered about for the source of the water-like noise. Before him in the undetermined shadows he discerned the dim and puzzling contours of an object that he could liken only to some enormous clepsydra or fountain surrounded with grotesque carvings.\n\nThe light seemed to fail momentary. Unable to decide the nature of the object, and having neither torch nor candle, he tore a strip from the hem of his hempen burnoose, and lit the slow-burning cloth and held it aloft at arm's length before him. By the dull, smouldering luminance thus obtained, the jewelers beheld more clearly the thing that bulked prodigious and monstrous, rearing above them from the fragment-lit-tered floor to the shadowy roof.\n\nThe thing was like some blasphemous dream of a mad devil. Its main portion or body was urn-like in form and was pedestalled on a queerly tilted block of stone at the vault's center. It was palish and pitted with innumerable small apertures. From its bosom and flat-tened base many arm-like and leg-like projections trailed in swollen nightmare segments to the ground; and two other members, sloping tautly, reached down like roots into an open and seemingly empty sarcophagus of gilded metal, graven with weird archaic ciphers, that stood beside the block.\n\nThe urn-shaped torso was endowed with two heads. One of these heads was beaked like a cuttlefish and was lined with long oblique slits where the eyes should have been. The other head, in cose juxta-position on the narrow shoulders, was that of an aged man dark and regal and terrible, whose burning eyes were like balas-rubies and whose grizzled beard had grown to the length of jungle moss on the loathsomely porous trunk. This trunk, on the side below the human head, dis-played a faint outline as of ribs; and some of the members ended in human hands and feet, or possessed anthropomorphic jointings.\n\nThrough heads, limbs and body there ran recurrently the mysteri-ous noise of regurgitation that had drawn Milab and Marabac to enter the vault. At each repetition of the sound a slimy dew exuded from the monstrous pores and rilled sluggishly down in endless drops.\n\nThe jewelers were held speechless and immobile by a clammy ter-ror. Unable to avert their gaze, they met the baleful eyes of the human head, glaring upon them from its unearthly eminence. Then, as the hempen strip in Milab's fingers burned slowly away and failed to a red smoulder, and darkness gathered again in the vault, they saw the blind slits in the other head open gradually, pouring forth a hot, yellow, intolerably flaming light as they expanded to immense round orbits. At the same time they heard a singular drum-like throbbing, as if the heart of the huge monster had become audible.\n\nThey knew only that a strange horror not of earth or but partially of earth, was before them. The sight deprived them of thought and memory. Least of all did they remember the storyteller in Faraad, and the tale he had told concerning the hidden tomb of Ossaru and Nioth Korghai, and the prophecy of the tomb's finding by those who should come to it unaware.\n\nSwiftly, with a dreadful stretching and straightening, the monster lifted its foremost members, ending in the brown, shrivelled hands of an old man, and reached out toward the jewelers. From the cuttlefish beak there issued a shrill demonian cackling; from the mouth of the kingly greybeard head a sonorous voice began to utter words of solemn cadence, like some enchanter's rune, in a tongue unknown to Milab and Marabac.\n\nThey recoiled before the abhorrently groping hands. In a frenzy of fear and panic, by the streaming light of its incandescent orbs, they saw the anomaly rise and lumber forward from its stone seat, walking clumsily and uncertainly on its ill-assorted members. There was a trampling of elephantine pads-and a stumbling of human feet inadequate to bear up their share of the blasphemous hulk. The two stiffly sloping ten-tacles were withdrawn from the gold sarcophagus, their ends muffled by empty, jewel-sewn cloths of a precious purple, such as would be used for the winding of some royal mummy. With a ceaseless and insane cackling, a malign thundering as of curses that broke to senile quavers., the double-headed horror leaned toward Milab and Marabac.\n\nTurning, they ran wildly across the roomy vault. Before them, illumined now by the pouring rays from the monster's orbits, they saw the half-open door of somber metal whose bolts and hinges had rusted away, permitting it to sag inward. The door was of cyclopean height and breadth, as if designed for beings huger than man. Beyond it were the dim reaches of a twilight corridor.\n\nFive paces from the doorway there was a faint red line that fol-lowed the chamber's conformation on the dusty floor. Marabac, a little ahead of his brother, crossed the line. As if checked in mid-air by some invisible wall, he faltered and stopped. His limbs and body seemed to melt away beneath the burnoose — the burnoose itself became tattered as with incalculable age. Dust floated on the air in a tenuous cloud, and there was a momentary gleaming of white bones where his outflung hands had been. Then the bones too were gone — and an empty heap of rags lay rotting on the floor.\n\nA faint odor as of corruption rose to the nostrils of Milab. Uncom-prehending, he had checked his own flight for an instant. Then, on his shoulders, he felt the grasp of slimy, withered hands. The cackling and muttering of the heads was like a demon chorus behind him. The drum-like beating, the noise of rising fountains, were loud in his ears. With one swiftly dying scream he followed Marabac over the red line.\n\nThe enormity that was both man and star-born monster, the name-less amalgam of an unearthly resurrection, stiff lumbered on and did not pause. With the hands of that Ossaru who had forgotten his own enchantment, it reached for the two piles of empty rags. Reaching, it entered the zone of death and dissolution which Ossaru himself had established to guard the vault forever. For an instant, on the air, there was a melting as of misshapen cloud, a falling as of light ashes. After that the darkness returned, and with the darkness, silence.\n\nNight settled above that nameless land, that forgotten city; and with its coming the Ghorii, who had followed Milab and Marabac over the desert plain. Swiftly they slew and ate the camel that waited pa-tiently at the palace entrance. Later, in the old hall of columns, they found that opening in the dais through which the jewelers had de-scended. Hungrily they gathered about the hole, sniffing at the tomb beneath. Then, baffled, they went away, their keen nostrils telling them that the scent was lost, that the tomb was empty either of life or death.",

        "content": "\n\nSubtle and manifold are the nets of the Demon, who followeth his chosen from birth to death and from death to death, throughout many lives.\n\n—The Testaments of Carnamagos\n\nLong had the wasting summer pastured its suns, like fiery red stallions, on the dun hills that crouched before the Mykrasian Mountains in wild easternmost Cincor. The peak-fed torrents were become tenuous threads or far-sundered, fallen pools; the granite boulder were shaled by the heat; the bare earth was cracked and creviced; and the low, meager grasses were seared even to the roots.\n\nSo it occurred that the boy Xeethra, tending the black and piebald goats of his uncle Pornos, was obliged to follow his charges further each day on the combes and hilltops. In an afternoon of late summer he came to a deep, craggy valley which he had never before visited. Here a cool and shadowy tarn was watered by hidden well-springs; and the ledgy slopes about the tarn were mantled with herbage and bushes that had not wholly lost their vernal greenness.\n\nSurprised and enchanted, the young goatherd followed his capering flock into this sheltered paradise. There was small likelihood that the goats of Pornos would stray afield from such goodly pasturage; so Xeethra did not trouble himself to watch them any longer. Entranced by his surroundings, he began to explore the valley, after quenching his thirst at the clear waters that sparkled like golden wine.\n\nTo him, the place seemed a veritable garden-pleasance. Forgetting the distance he had already come, and the wrath of Pornos if the flock should return late for the milking, he wandered deeper among the winding crags that protected the valley. On every hand the rocks grew sterner and wilder; the valley straitened; and he stood presently at its end, where a rugged wall forbade further progress.\n\nFeeling a vague disappointment, he was about to turn and retrace his wanderings. Then, in the base of the sheer wall, he perceived the mysterious yawning of a cavern. It seemed that the rock must have opened only a little while before his coming: for the lines of cleavage were clearly marked, and the cracks made in the surrounding surface were unclaimed by the moss that grew plentifully elsewhere. From the cavern's creviced lip there sprang a stunted tree, with its newly broken roots hanging in air; and the stubborn tap-root was in the rock at Xeethra's feet, where, it was plain, the tree had formerly stood.\n\nWondering and curious, the boy peered into the inviting gloom of the cavern, from which, unaccountably, a soft balmy air now began to blow. There were strange odors in the air, suggesting the pungency of temple incense, the languor and luxury of opiate blossoms. They disturbed the senses of Xeethra; and, at the same time,, they seduced him with their promise of unbeholden marvellous things. Hesitating, he tried to remember certain legends that Pornos had once told him: legends that concerned such hidden caverns as the one on which he had stumbled. But it seemed that the tales had faded now from his mind, leaving only a dim sense of things that were perilous, forbidden and magical. He thought that the cavern was the portal of some undiscovered world—and the portal had opened to permit his entrance. Being of a nature both venturesome and visionary, he was undeterred by the fears that others might have felt in his place. Overpowered by a great curiosity, he soon entered the cave, carrying for a torch a dry, resinous bough that had fallen from the tree in the cliff.\n\nBeyond the mouth he was swallowed by a rough-arched passage that pitched downward like the gorge of some monstrous dragon. The torch's flame blew back, flaring and smoking in the warm aromatic wind that strengthened from unknown depths. The cave steepened perilously; but Xeethra continued his exploration, climbing down by the stair-like coigns and projections of the stone.\n\nLike a dreamer in a dream, he was wholly absorbed by the mystery on which he had happened; and at no time did he recall his abandoned duty. He lost all reckoning of the time consumed in his descent. Then suddenly, his torch was extinguished by a hot gust that blew upon him like the expelled breath of some prankish demon.\n\nFeeling the assailment of a black panic, he tottered in darkness and sought to secure his footing on the dangerous incline. But, ere he could relume the blown-out torch, he saw that the night around him was not complete, but was tempered by a wan, golden glimmering from the depths below. Forgetting his alarm in a new wonder, he descended toward the mysterious light.\n\nAt the bottom of the long incline, Xeethra passed through a low cavern-mouth and emerged into sun-bright radiance. Dazzled and bewildered, he thought for a moment that his subterranean wanderings had brought him back to the outer air in some unsuspected land lying among the Mykrasian hills. Yet surely the region before him was no part of summer-stricken Cincor: for he saw neither hills nor mountains nor the black sapphire heaven from which the aging but despotic sun glared down with implacable drouth on the kingdoms of Zothique.\n\nHe stood on the threshold of a fertile plain that lapsed illimitably into golden distance under the measureless arch of a golden vault. Far off, through the misty radiance, there was a dim towering of unidentifiable masses that might have been spires and domes and ramparts. A level meadow lay at his feet, covered with close-grown curling sward that had the greenness of verdigris; and the sward, at intervals, was studded with strange blossoms appearing to turn and move like living eyes. Near at hand, beyond the meadow, was an orchard-like grove of tall, amply spreading trees amid whose lush leafage he descried the burning of numberless dark-red fruits. The plain, to all seeming, was empty of human life; and no birds flew in the fiery air or perched on the laden boughs. There was no sound other than the sighing of leaves: a sound like the hissing of many small hidden serpents.\n\nTo the boy from the parched hill-country, this realm was an Eden of untasted delights. But, for a little while, he was stayed by the strangeness of it all, and by the sense of weird and preternatural vitality which informed the whole landscape. Flakes of fire appeared to descend and melt in the rippling air; the grasses coiled with verminous writhings; the flowery eyes returned his regard intently; the trees palpitated as if a sanguine ichor flowed within them in lieu of sap; and the undernote of adder-like hissings amid the foliage grew louder and sharper.\n\nXeethra, however, was deterred only by the thought that a region so fair and fertile must belong to some jealous owner who would resent his intrusion. He scanned the unpeopled plain with much circumspection. Then, deeming himself secure from observation, he yielded to the craving that had been roused within him by the red, luxuriant fruit.\n\nThe turf was elastic beneath him, like a living substance, as he ran forward to the nearest trees. Bowed with their shining globes, the branches drooped around him. He plucked several of the largest fruits and stored them thriftily in the bosom of his threadbare tunic. Then, unable to resist his appetence any longer, he began to devour one of the fruits. The rind broke easily under his teeth, and it seemed that a royal wine, sweet and puissant, was poured into his mouth from an overbrimming cup. He felt in his throat and bosom a swift warmth that almost suffocated him; and a strange fever sang in his ears and wildered his senses. It passed quickly, and he was startled from his bemusement by the sound of voices falling as if from an airy height.\n\nHe knew instantly that the voices were not those of men. They filled his ears with a rolling as of baleful drums, heavy with ominous echoes; yet it seemed that they spoke in articulate words, albeit of a strange language. Looking up between the thick boughs, he beheld a sight that inspired him with terror. Two beings of colossean stature, tall as the watchtowers of the mountain people, stood waist-high above the near trretops. It was as if they had appeared by sorcery from the green ground or the gold heavens: for surely the clumps of vegetation, dwarfed into bushes by their bulk, could never have concealed them from Xeethra's discernment.\n\nThe figures were clad in black armor, lusterless and gloomy, such as demons might wear in the service of Thasaidon, lord of the bottomless underworlds. Xeethra felt sure that they had seen him; and perhaps their unintelligible converse concerned his presence. He trembled, thinking now that he had trespassed on the gardens of genii. Peering fearfully from his covert, he could discern no features beneath the frontlets of the dark helms that were bowed toward him: but eye-like spots of yellowish-red fire, restless as marsh-lights, shifted to and from in void shadow where the faces should have been.\n\nIt seemed to Xeethra that the rich foliage could afford no shelter from the scrutiny of these beings, the guardians of the land on which he had so rashly intruded. He was overwhelmed by a consciousness of guilt: the sibilant leaves, the drum-like voices of the giants, the eye-shaped flowers—all appeared to accuse him of trespass and thievery. At the same time he was perplexed by a queer and unwonted vagueness in regard to his own identity: somehow it was not Xeethra the goatherd... but another... who had found the bright garden-realm and had eaten the blood-dark fruit. This alien self was without name or formulable memory; but there was a flickering of confused lights, a murmur of indistinguishable voices, amid the stirred shadows of his mind. Again he felt the weird warmth, the swift-mounting fever, that had followed the devouring of the fruit.\n\nFrom all this, he was aroused by a livid flash of light that clove downward toward him across the branches. Whether a bolt of levin had issued from the clear vault, or whether one of the armored beings had brandished a great sword, he was never quite sure afterwards. The light seared his vision, he recoiled in uncontrollable fright, and found himself running, half-blind, across the open turf. Through whirling bolts of color he saw before him, in a sheer, topless cliff, the cavern-mouth through which he had come. Behind him he heard a long rumbling as of summer thunder... or the laughter of colossi.\n\nWithout pausing to retrieve the still-burning brand he had left at the entrance, Xeethra plunged incontinently into the dark cave. Through Stygian murk he managed to grope his way upward on the perilous incline. Reeling, stumbling, bruising himself at every turn, he came at last to the outer exit, in the hidden valley behind the hills of Cincor.\n\nTo his consternation, twilight had fallen during his absence in the world beyond the cave. Stars crowded above the grim crags that walled the valley; and the skies of burnt-out purple were gored by the sharp horn of an ivory moon. Still fearing the pursuit of the giant guardians, and apprehending also the wrath of his uncle Pornos, Xeethra hastened back to the little tarn, collected his flock, and drove it homeward through the long, gloomy miles.\n\nDuring that journey, it seemed that a fever burned and died within him at intervals, bringing strange fancies. He forgot his fear of Pornos, forgot, indeed, that he was Xeethra, the humble and disregarded goatherd. He was returning to another abode than the squalid hut of Pornos, built of clay and brushwood. In a high-domed city, gates of burnished metal would open for him, and fiery-colored banners would stream on the perfumed air; and silver trumpets and the voices of blonde odalisques and black chamberlains would greet him as king in a thousand-columned hall. The ancient pomp of royalty, familiar as air and light, would surround him, and he, the King Amero, who had newly come to the throne, would rule as his fathers had ruled over all the kingdom of Calyz by the orient sea. Into his capital, on shaggy camels, the fierce southern tribesmen would bring a levy of date-wine and desert sapphires; and galleys from isles beyond the morning would burden his wharves with their semi-annual tribute of spices and strange-dyed fabrics...\n\nSurging and fading like pictures of delirium but lucid as daily memories, the madness came and went; and once again he was the nephew of Pornos, returning belated with the flock.\n\nLike a downward-thrusting blade, the red moon had fixed itself in the somber hills when Xeethra reached the rough wooden pen in which Pornos kept his goats. Even as Xeethra had expected, the old man was waiting at the gate, bearing in one hand a clay lantern and in the other a staff of briarwood. He began to curse the boy with half-senile vehemence, waving the staff, and threatening to beat him for his tardiness.\n\nXeethra did not flinch before the staff. Again, in his fancy, he was Amero, the young king of Calyz. Bewildered and astonished, he saw before him by the light of the shaken lantern a foul and rancid-smelling ancient whom he could not remember. Hardly could he understand the speech of Pornos; the man's anger puzzled but did not frighten him; and his nostrils, as if accustomed only to delicate perfumes, were offended by the goatish stench. As if for the first time, he heard the bleating of the tired flock, and gazed in wild surprise at the wattled pen and the hut beyond.\n\n\"Is it for this,\" cried Pornos, \"that I have reared my sister's orphan at great expense? Accursed moon-calf! Thankless whelp! If you have lost a milch-goat or a single kid, I shall flay you from thigh to shoulder.\"\n\nDeeming that the silence of the youth was due to mere obstinacy, Pornos began to beat him with the staff. At the first blow, the bright cloud lifted from Xeethra's mind. Dodging the briarwood with agility, he tried to tell Pornos of the new pasture he had found among the hills. At this the old man suspended his blows, and Xeethra went on to tell of the strange cave that had conducted him to an unguessed garden-land. To support his story he reached within his tunic for the blood-red apples he had stolen; but, to his confoundment, the fruits were gone, and he knew not whether he had lost them in the dark or whether, perhaps, they had vanished by virtue of some indwelling necromancy.\n\nPornos, interrupting the boy with frequent scoldings, heard him at first with open unbelief. But he grew silent as the youth went on, and when the story was done, he cried out in a trembling voice:\n\n\"Ill was this day, for you have wandered among enchantments. Verily, there in no tarn such as you have described amid the hills; nor, at this season, has any herder found such pasturage. These things were illusions, designed to lead you astray; and the cave, I wot, was no honest cave but an entrance into hell. I have heard my fathers tell that the gardens of Thasaidon, king of the seven underworlds, lie near to the earth's surface in this region; and caves have opened ere this, like a portal, and the sons of men, trespassing unaware on the gardens, have been tempted by the fruit and eaten it. But madness comes thereof and much sorrow and long damnation: for the Demon, they say, forgetting not one stolen apple, will exact his price in the end. Woe! woe! the goat-milk will be soured for a whole moon by the grass of such wizard pasture; and, after all the food and care you have cost me, I must find another stripling to ward the flocks.\"\n\nOnce more, as he listened, the burning cloud returned upon Xeethra.\n\n\"Old man, I know you not,\" he said perplexedly. Then, using soft words of a courtly speech but half-intelligible to Pornos: \"It would seem that I have gone astray. Prithee, where lies the kingdom of Calyz? I am king thereof, being newly crowned in the high city of Shathair, over which my fathers have ruled for a thousand years.\"\n\n\"Ai! Ai!\" wailed Pornos. \"The boy is daft. These notions have come through the eating of the Demon's apple. Cease your maundering, and help me to milk the goats. You are none other than the child of my sister Askli, who was delivered these nineteen years agone after her husband, Outhoth, had died of a dysentery. Askli lived not long, and I, Pornos, have reared you as a son, and the goats have mothered you.\"\n\n\"I must find my kingdom,\" persisted Xeethra. \"I am lost in darkness, amid uncouth things, and how I have wandered here I cannot remember. Old man, I would have you give me food and lodging for the night. In the dawn I shall journey toward Shathair, by the orient main.\"\n\nPornos, shaking and muttering, lifted his clay lantern to the boy's face. It seemed that a stranger stood before him, in whose wide and wondering eyes the flame of golden lamps was somehow reflected. There was no wildness in Xeethra's demeanor, but merely a sort of gentle pride and remoteness; and he wore his threadbare tunic with a strange grace. Surely, however, he was demented; for his manner and speech were past understanding. Pornos, mumbling under his breath, but no longer urging the boy to assist him, turned to the milking...\n\n* * *\n\nXeethra woke betimes in the white dawn, and peered with amazement at the mud-plastered walls of the hovel in which he had dwelt since birth. All was alien and baffling to him; and especially was he troubled by his rough garments and by the sun-swart tawniness of his skin: for such were hardly proper to the young King Amero, whom he believed himself to be. His circumstances were wholly inexplicable; and he felt an urgency to depart at once on his homeward journey.\n\nHe rose quietly from the litter of dry grasses that had served him for a bed. Pornos, lying in a corner, still slept the sleep of age and senescence; and Xeethra was careful not to awaken him. He was both puzzled and repelled by this unsavory ancient, who had fed him on the previous evening with coarse millet-bread and the strong milk and cheese of goats, and had given him the hospitality of a fetid hut. He had paid little heed to the mumblings and objurgations of Pornos; but it was plain that the old man doubted his claims to royal rank, and, moreover, was possessed of peculiar delusions regarding his identity.\n\nLeaving the hovel, Xeethra followed an eastward-winding footpath amid the stony hills. He knew not whither the path would lead: but reasoned that Calyz, being the easternmost realm of the continent Zothique, was situated somewhere below the rising sun. Before him, in vision, the verdant vales of his kingdom hovered liked a fair mirage, and the swelling domes of Shathair were as morning cumuli piled in the orient. These things, he deemed, were memories of yesterday. He could not recall the circumstances of his departure and his absence; but surely the land over which he ruled was not remote.\n\nThe path turned among lessening ridges, and Xeethra came to the small village of Cith, to whose inhabitants he was known. The place was alien to him now, seeming no more than a cirque of filthy hovels that reeked and festered under the sun. The people gathered about him, calling him by name, and staring and laughing oafishly when he inquired the road to Calyz. No one, it appeared, had ever heard of this kingdom or of the city of Shathair. Noting a strangeness in Xeethra's demeanor, and deeming that his queries were those of a madman, the people began to mock him. Children pelted him with dry clods and pebbles; and thus he was driven from Cith, following an eastern road that ran from Cincor into the neighboring lowlands of the country of Zhel.\n\nSustained only by the vision of his lost kingdom, the youth wandered for many moons throughout Zothique. People derided him when he spoke of his kingship and made inquiry concerning Calyz; but many, thinking madness a sacred thing, offered him shelter and sustenance. Amid the far-stretching fruitful vineyards of Zhel, and into Istanam of the myriad cities; over the high passes of Ymorth, where snow tarried at the autumn's beginning; and across the salt-pale desert of Dhir, Xeethra followed that bright imperial dream which had now become his only memory. Always eastward he went, travelling sometimes with caravans whose members hoped that a madman's company would bring them good fortune; but oftener he went as a solitary wayfarer.\n\nAt whiles, for a brief space, his dream deserted him, and he was only the simple goatherd, lost in foreign realms, and homesick for the barren hills of Cincor. Then, once more, he remembered his kingship, and the opulent gardens of Shathair and the proud palaces, and the names and faces of them that had served him following the death of his father, King Eldamaque, and his own succession to the throne.\n\nAt midwinter, in the far city of Sha-Karag, Xeethra met certain sellers of amulets from Ustaim, who smiled oddly when he asked if they could direct him to Calyz. Winking among themselves when he spoke of his royal rank, the merchants told him that Calyz was situated several hundred leagues beyond Sha-Karag, below the orient sun.\n\n\"Hail, O King,\" they said with mock ceremony. \"Long and merrily may you reign in Shathair.\"\n\nVery joyful was Xeethra, hearing word of his lost kingdom for the first time, and knowing now that it was more than a dream or a figment of madness. Tarrying no longer in Sha-Karag, he journeyed on with all possible haste...\n\nWhen the first moon of spring was a frail crescent at eve, he knew that he neared his destination. For Canopus burned high in the eastern heavens, mounting gloriously amid the smaller stars even as he had once seen it from his palace-terrace in Shathair.\n\nHis heart leapt with the gladness of homecoming; but much he marvelled at the wildness and sterility of the region through which he passed. It seemed that there were no travellers coming and going from Calyz; and he met only a few nomads, who fled at his approach like the creatures of the waste. The highway was overgrown with grasses and cacti, and was rutted only by the winter rains. Beside it, anon, he came to a stone terminus carved in the form of a rampant lion, that had marked the western boundary of Calyz. The lion's features had crumbled away, and his paws and body were lichened, and it seemed that long ages of desolation had gone over him. A chill dismay was born in Xeethra's heart: for only yesteryear, if his memory served him rightly, he had ridden past the lion with his father Eldamaque, hunting hyenas, and had remarked then the newness of the carving.\n\nNow, from the high ridge of the border, he gazed down upon Calyz, which had lain like a long verdant scroll beside the sea. To his wonderment and consternation, the wide fields were sere as if with autumn; the rivers were thin threads that wasted themselves in sand; the hills were gaunt as the ribs of unceremented mummies; and there was no greenery other than the scant herbage which a desert bears in spring. Far off, by the purple main, he thought that he beheld the shining of the marble domes of Shathair; and, fearing that some blight of hostile sorcery had fallen upon his kingdom, he hastened toward the city.\n\nEverywhere, as he wandered heartsick through the vernal day, he found that the desert had established its empire. Void were the fields, unpeopled the villages. The cots had tumbled into midden-like heaps of ruin; and it seemed that a thousand seasons of drouth had withered the fruitful orchards, leaving only a few black and decaying stumps.\n\nIn the late afternoon he entered Shathair, which had been the white mistress of the orient sea. The streets and the harbor were alike empty, and silence sat on the broken housetops and the ruining walls. The great bronze obelisks were greened with antiquity; the massy marmorean temples of the gods of Calyz leaned and slanted to their fall.\n\nTardily, as one who fears to confirm an expected thing, Xeethra came to the palace of the monarchs. Not as he recalled it, a glory of soaring marble half veiled by flowering almonds and trees of spice and high-pulsing fountains, but in stark dilapidation amid blasted gardens, the palace awaited him, while the brief, illusory rose of sunset faded upon its dome, leaving them wan as mausoleums.\n\nHow long the place had lain desolate, he could not know. Confusion filled him, and he was whelmed by utter loss and despair. It seemed that none remained to greet him amid the ruins; but, nearing the portals of the west wing, he saw, as it were, a fluttering of shadows that appeared to detach themselves from the gloom beneath the portico; and certain dubious beings, clothed in rotten tatter, came sidling and crawling before him on the cracked pavement. Pieces of their raiment dropped from them as they moved; and about them was an unnamed horror of filth, of squalor and disease. When they neared him, Xeethra saw that most of them were lacking in some member or feature, and that all were marked by the gnawing of leprosy.\n\nHis gorge rose within him, and he could not speak. But the lepers hailed him with hoarse cries and hollow croakings, as if deeming him another outcast who had come to join them in their abode amid the ruins.\n\n\"Who are ye that dwell in my palace of Shathair?\" he inquired at length. \"Behold! I am King Amero, the son of Eldamaque, and I have returned from a far land to resume the throne of Calyz.\"\n\nAt this, a loathsome cackling and tittering arose among the lepers. \"We alone are the kings of Calyz,\" one of them told the youth. \"The land has been a desert for centuries, and the city of Shathair had long lain unpeople save by such as we, who were driven out from other places. Young man, you are welcome to share the realm with us: for another king, more or less, is a small matter here.\"\n\nThen, with obscene cachinnations, the lepers jeered at Xeethra and derided him; and he, standing amid the dark fragments of his dream, could find no words to answer them. However, one of the oldest lepers, well-night limbless and faceless, shared not in the mirth of his fellows, but seemed to ponder and reflect; and he said at last to Xeethra, in a voice issuing thickly from the black pit of his gaping mouth:\n\n\"I have heard something of the history of Calyz, and the names of Amero and Eldamaque are familiar to me. In bygone ages certain of the rulers were named thus; but I know not which of them was the son and which the father. Haply both are now entombed with the rest of their dynasty, in the deep-lying vaults beneath the palace.\"\n\nNow, in the greying twilight, other lepers emerged from the shadowy ruin and gathered about Xeethra. Hearing that he laid claim to the kingship of the desert realm, certain of their number went away and returned presently, bearing vessels filled with rank water and mouldy victuals, which they proffered to Xeethra, bowing low with a mummery as of chamberlains serving a monarch.\n\nXeethra turned from them in loathing, though he was famished and athirst. He fled through the ashen gardens, among the dry fountain-mouths and dusty plots. Behind him he heard the hideous mirth of the lepers; but the sound grew fainter, and it seemed that they did not follow him. Rounding the vast palace in his flight, he met no more of these creatures. The portals of the south wing and the east wing were dark and empty, but he did not care to enter them, knowing that desolation and things worse than desolation were the sole tenants.\n\nWholly distraught and despairing, he came to the eastern wing and paused in the gloom. Dully, and with a sense of dream-like estrangement, he became aware that he stood on that very terrace above the sea, which he had remembered so often during his journey. Bare were the ancient flower-beds; the trees had rotted away in their sunken basins; and the great flags of the pavement were runneled and broken. But the veils of twilight were tender upon the ruin; and the sea sighed as of yore under a purple shrouding; and the mighty star Canopus climbed in the east, with the lesser stars still faint around him.\n\nBitter was the heart of Xeethra, thinking himself a dreamer beguiled by some idle dream. He shrank from the high splendor of Canopus, as if from a flame too bright to bear; but, ere he could turn away, it seemed that a column of shadow, darker than the night and thicker than any cloud, rose upward before him from the terrace and blotted out the effulgent star. Out of the solid stone the shadow grew, towering tall and colossal; and it took on the outlines of a mailed warrior; and it seemed that the warrior looked down upon Xeethra from a great height with eyes that shone and shifted like fireballs in the darkness of his face under the lowering helmet.\n\nConfusedly, as one who recalls an old dream, Xeethra remembered a boy who had herded goats upon summer-stricken hills; and who, one day, had found a cavern that opened portal-like on a garden-land of strangeness and marvel. Wandering there, the boy had eaten a blood-dark fruit and had fled in a terror before the black-armored giants who warded the garden. Again he was that boy; and still he was the King Amero, who had sought for his lost realm through many regions; and, finding it in the end, had found only the abomination of desolation.\n\nNow, as the trepidation of the goatherd, guilty of theft and trespass, warred in his soul with the pride of the king, he heard a voice that rolled through the heavens like thunder from a high cloud in the spring night:\n\n\"I am the emissary of Thasaidon, who sends me in due course to all who have passed the nether portals and tasted the fruit of his garden. No man, having eaten the fruit, shall remain thereafter as he was before; but to some the fruit brings oblivion, and to others, memory. Know, then, that in another birth, ages agone, you were indeed the young King Amero. The memory, being strong upon you, has effaced the remembrance of your present life, and has driven you forth to seek your ancient kingdom.\"\n\n\"If this be true, then doubly am I bereft,\" said Xeethra, bowing sorrowfully before the shadow. \"For, being Amero, I am throneless and realmless; and, being Xeethra, I cannot forget my former royalty and regain the content which I knew as a simple goatherd.\"\n\n\"Harken, for there is another way,\" said the shadow, its voice muted like the murmur of a far ocean. \"Thasaidon is the master of all sorceries, and a giver of magic gifts to those who serve him and acknowledge him as their lord. Pledge your allegiance, promise your soul to him; and in fee thereof, the Demon will surely reward you. If it be your wish, he can wake again the buried past with his necromancy. Again, as King Amero, you shall reign over Calyz; and all things shall be as they were in the perished years; and the dead faces and the fields now desert shall bloom again.\"\n\n\"I accept the bond,\" said Xeethra. \"I plight my fealty to Thasaidon, and I promise my soul to him if he, in return, will give me back my kingdom.\"\n\n\"There is more to be said,\" resumed the shadow. \"Not wholly have you remembered your other life, but merely those years that correspond to your present youth. Living again as Amero, perhaps you will regret your royalty in time; and if such regret should overcome you, leading you to forget a monarch's duty, then the whole necromancy shall end and vanish like vapor.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" said Xeethra. \"This, too, I accept as part of the bargain.\"\n\nWhen the words ended, he beheld no longer the shadow towering against Canopus. The star flamed with a pristine splendor, as if no cloud had ever dimmed it; and without sense of change or transition, he who watched the star was none other than King Amero; and the goatherd Xeethra, and the emissary, and the pledge given to Thasaidon, were as things that had never been. The ruin that had come upon Shathair was no more than the dream of some mad prophet; for in the nostrils of Amero the perfume of languorous flowers mingled with salt sea-balsams; and in his ears the grave murmur of ocean was pierced by the amorous plaint of lyres and a shrill laughter of slave-girls from the palace behind him. He heard the myriad noises of the nocturnal city, where his people feasted and made jubilee; and, turning from the star with a mystic pain and an obscure joy in his heart, Amero beheld the effulgent portals and windows of his father's house, and the far-mounting light from a thousand flambeaux that paled the stars as they passed over Shathair.\n\nIt is written in the old chronicles that King Amero reigned for many prosperous years. Peace and abundance were upon all the realm of Calyz; the drouth came not from the desert, nor violent gales from the main; and tribute was sent at the ordained seasons to Amero from the subject isles and outlying lands. And Amero was well content, dwelling superbly in rich-arrased halls, feasting and drinking royally, and hearing the praise of his lute-players and his chamberlains and lemans.\n\nWhen his life was little past the meridian years, there came at whiles to Amero something of that satiety which lies in wait for the minions of fortune. At such times he turned from the cloying pleasures of the court and found delight in blossoms and leaves and the verses of olden poets. Thus was satiety held at bay; and, since the duties of the realm rested lightly upon him, Amero still found his kingship a goodly thing.\n\nThen, in a latter autumn, it seemed that the stars looked disastrously on Calyz. Murrain and blight and pestilence rode abroad as if on the wings of unseen dragons. The coast of the kingdom was beset and sorely harried by pirate galleys. Upon the west, the caravans coming and going through Calyz were assailed by redoubtable bands of robbers; and certain fierce desert peoples made war on the villages lying near to the southern border. The land was filled with turmoil and death, with lamentations and many miseries.\n\nDeep was Amero's concern, hearing the distressful complaints that were brought before him daily. Being but little skilled in kingcraft, and wholly untried by the ordeals of dominion, he sought counsel of his courtlings but was ill advised by them. The troubles of the realm multiplied upon him; uncurbed by authority, the wild peoples of the waste grew bolder, and the pirates gathered like vultures of the sea. Famine and drouth divided his realm with the plague; and it seemed to Amero, in his sore perplexity, that such matters were beyond all medication; and his crown was become a too onerous burden.\n\nStriving to forget his own impotence and the woeful plight of his kingdom, he gave himself to long nights of debauch. But the wine refused its oblivion, and love had now forfeited its rapture. He sought other divertissements, calling before him strange makers and mummers and buffoons, and assembling outlandish singers and the players of uncouth instruments. Daily he made proclamations of a high reward to any that could bemuse him from his cares.\n\nWild songs and sorcerous ballads of yore were sung to him by immortal minstrels; the black girls of the north, with amber-dappled limbs, danced before him their weird lascivious measures; the blowers of the horns of chimeras played a mad and secret tune; and savage drummers pounded a troublous music on drums made from the skin of cannibals; while men clothed with the scales and pelts of half-mythic monsters ramped or crawled grotesquely through the halls of the palace. But all these were vain to beguile the king from his grievous musings.\n\nOne afternoon, as he sat heavily in his hall of audience, there came to him a player of pipes who was clad in tattered homespun. The eyes of the man were bright as newly stirred embers, and his face was burned to a cindery blackness, as if by the ardor of outland suns. Hailing Amero with small servility, he announced himself as a goatherd who had come to Shathair from a region of valleys and mountains lying sequestered beyond the bourn of sunset.\n\n\"O King, I know the melodies of oblivion,\" he said, \"and I would play for you, though I desire not the reward you have offered. If haply I succeed in diverting, I shall take my own guerdon in due time.\"\n\n\"Play, then,\" said Amero, feeling a faint interest rise within him at the bold speech of the piper.\n\nForthwith, on his pipes of reed, the black goatherd began a music that was like the falling and rippling of water in quiet vales, and the passing of wind over lonely hilltops. Subtly the pipes told of freedom and peace and forgetfulness lying beyond the sevenfold purple of outland horizons. Dulcetly they sang of a place where the years came not with an iron trampling, but were soft of tread as a zephyr shod with flower petals. There the world's turmoil and troubling were lost upon measureless leagues of silence, and the burdens of empire were blown away like thistledown. There the goatherd, tending his flock on solitary fells, was possessed of tranquillity sweeter than the power of monarchs.\n\nAs he listened to the piper, a sorcery crept upon the mind of Amero. The weariness of kingship, the cares and perplexities, were as dream-bubbles lapsing in some Lethean tide. He beheld before him, in sun-bright verdure and stillness, the enchanted vales evoked by the music; and he himself was the goatherd, following grassy paths, or lying oblivious of the vulture hours by the margin of lulled waters.\n\nHardly he knew that the low piping had ceased. But the vision darkened, and he who had dreamt of a goatherd's peace was again a troubled king.\n\n\"Play on!\" he cried to the black piper. \"Name your own guerdon—and play.\"\n\nThe eyes of the goatherd burned like embers in a dark place at evening. \"Not till the passing of ages and the falling of kingdoms shall I require of you my reward,\" he said enigmatically. \"However, I shall play for you once more.\"\n\nSo, through the afternoon, King Amero was beguiled by that sorcerous piping which told ever of a far land of ease and forgetfulness. With each playing it seemed that the spell grew stronger upon him; and more and more was his royalty a hateful thing; and the very grandeur of his palace oppressed and stifled him. No longer could he endure the heavily jewelled yoke of duty; and madly he envied the carefree lot of the goatherd.\n\nAt twilight he dismissed the ministrants who attended him, and held speech alone with the piper.\n\n\"Lead me to this land of yours,\" he said, \"where I may dwell as a simple herder.\"\n\nClad in mufti, so that his people might not recognise him, the king stole from the palace through an unguarded postern, accompanied by the piper. Night, like a formless monster with the crescent moon for its lowered horn, was crouching beyond the town; but in the streets the shadows were thrust back by a flaming of myriad cressets. Amero and his guide were unchallenged as they went toward the outer darkness. And the king repented not his forsaken throne: though he saw in the city a continual passing of biers laden with the victims of the plague; and faces gaunt with famine rose up from the shadows as if to accuse him of recreancy. These he heeded not: for his eyes were filled with the dream of a green silent valley, in a land lost beyond the turbid flowing of time with its wreckage and tumult.\n\nNow, as Amero followed the black piper, there descended upon him a sudden dimness; and he faltered in weird doubt and bewilderment. The street-lights flickered before him, and swiftly they expired in the gloom. The loud murmuring of the city fell away in a vast silence; and, like the shifting of some disordered dream, it seemed that the tall houses crumbled stiffly and were gone even as shadows, and the stars shone over broken walls. Confusion filled the thoughts and the sense of Amero; and in his heart was a black chill of desolation; and he seemed to himself as one who had known the lapse of long empty years, and the loss of high splendor; and who stood now amid the extremity of age and decay. In his nostrils was a dry mustiness such as the night draws from olden ruin; and it came to him, as a thing foreknown and now remembered obscurely, that the desert was lord in his proud capital of Shathair.\n\n\"Where have you led me?\" cried Amero to the piper.\n\nFor all reply, he heard a laughter that was like the peal of derisive thunder. The muffled shape of the goatherd towered colossally in the gloom, changing, growing, till its outlines were transformed to those of a giant warrior in sable armor. Strange memories thronged the mind of Amero, and he seemed to recall darkly something of another life... Somehow, somewhere, for a time, he had been the goatherd of his dreams, content and forgetful... somehow, somewhere, he had entered a strange bright garden and had eaten a blood-dark fruit...\n\nThen, in a flaring as of infernal levin, he remembered all, and knew the might shadow that towered above him like a Terminus reared in hell. Beneath his feet was the cracked pavement of the seaward terrace; and the stars above the emissary were those that precede Canopus; but Canopus himself was blotted out by the Demon's shoulder. Somewhere in the dusty darkness, a leper laughed and coughed thickly, prowling about the ruined palace in which had once dwelt the kings of Calyz. All things were even as they had been before the making of that bargain through which the perished kingdom had been raised up by the powers of hell.\n\nAnguish choked the heart of Xeethra as if with the ashes of burnt-out pyres and the shards of heaped ruin. Subtly and manifoldly had the Demon tempted him to his loss. Whether these things had been dream or necromancy or verity he knew not with sureness; nor whether they had happened once or had happened often. In the end there was only dust and dearth; and he, the doubly accurst, must remember and repent forevermore all that he had forfeited.\n\nHe cried out to the emissary: \"I have lost the bargain that I made with Thasaidon. Take now my soul and bear it before him where he sits aloft on his throne of ever-burning brass; for I would fulfil my bond to the uttermost.\"\n\n\"There is no need to take your soul,\" said the emissary, with an ominous rumble as of departing storm in the desolate night. \"Remain here with the lepers, or return to Pornos and his goats, as you will: it matters little.

"恶魔的罗网精微繁复，他追逐着选中之人，从生至死，从死至死，贯穿无数轮回。\n\n——《卡纳玛戈斯圣典》\n\n漫长的枯夏早已将如火的赤红烈驹放牧在辛科尔蛮荒极东之地，那些匍匐在迈克拉西安山脉前的黄褐色丘陵上。山涧激流化作游丝般的细线，或是干涸成零落的水洼；花岗岩巨砾在酷热中层层剥落；裸露的大地龟裂纵横；低矮稀疏的野草连根须都被烤焦。\n\n因此，少年克希特拉每日放牧叔父波诺斯的黑白花斑山羊时，不得不将羊群赶往更远的山脊与丘顶。在夏末某个午后，他来到一处从未涉足的嶙峋深谷。此处有口幽暗清凉的山潭，由隐秘泉眼滋养；潭边岩坡上覆盖着尚未褪尽春绿的繁茂草木。\n\n年轻的牧羊人又惊又喜，追随着欢跃的羊群踏入这片隐秘乐土。波诺斯的山羊绝无可能离开如此丰美的草场，克希特拉便不再费心看管。他被周遭景致迷住，在畅饮过如金色琼浆般闪烁的清泉后，开始探索山谷。\n\n此地于他恍若梦幻仙苑。他忘却了来时的路程，也忘却羊群若迟归挤奶将招致波诺斯的暴怒，只顾在环抱山谷的蜿蜒峭壁间愈行愈深。四周岩壁愈发险峻狂野，山谷骤然收窄，最终他被一堵嶙峋绝壁拦住去路。\n\n正当他怀着朦胧失落准备折返时，陡峭岩壁底部赫然现出一道幽深的洞窟。岩缝裂痕清晰可辨，周遭石面新绽的裂纹尚未被苔藓侵占——这洞窟想必是方才为他开启。洞口裂隙边缘横生着一株根系悬空的畸形矮树，其主根仍深嵌在克希特拉脚边的岩缝中，显然此处原是树木生长之地。\n\n少年满心好奇，窥探着洞中诱人的黑暗。此时莫名拂来阵阵温煦微风，夹杂着庙宇熏香的辛烈与罂粟花的慵奢芬芳。这气息扰乱了克希特拉的神智，同时又以未知奇景的承诺诱惑着他。踌躇间，他试图回忆波诺斯讲述的传说——关于此类隐秘洞窟的禁忌故事。但那些传说如今只在他脑中留下模糊的危险预兆。他认定这洞窟是通往未知世界的门扉，而门扉正为他敞开。天性既莽撞又爱幻想的他，毫不畏惧常人应有的顾虑。在强烈好奇心驱使下，他折下岩壁枯树上掉落的树脂枝干作为火把，毅然踏入洞穴。\n\n穿过洞口后，粗糙的拱形甬道如恶龙咽喉般将他吞噬。火把的烈焰在渐强的暖风中倒卷，腾起阵阵青烟。洞穴陡然下倾，险象环生，但克希特拉仍借助石阶般的凸岩继续下行。\n\n他如梦中人般全然沉醉于这场奇遇，将放牧职责抛诸脑后。在漫长的下降过程中，一阵灼热气浪突然扑灭了他的火把，恍若顽皮恶魔的吐息。\n\n黑暗中的恐慌令他踉跄不稳。正当他试图重新点燃火把时，却发现周遭并非全然漆黑——下方深处正泛着苍白的金色微光。新的惊奇驱散了恐惧，他朝着神秘光源继续下行。\n\n在漫长斜坡尽头，克希特拉穿过低矮洞口，蓦然置身于耀目光辉中。眩惑之间，他以为自己通过地底跋涉回到了迈克拉西安群山间的某处未知地域。然而眼前景象绝非饱受旱灾的辛科尔：这里既无山峦，也无青金石般的苍穹，更没有那衰老却暴虐的太阳向佐西克诸国倾泻的无情酷热。\n\n他站在丰饶平原的入口，金色穹顶之下，沃野无尽延伸至远方。迷蒙光辉中，隐约可见疑似尖塔、穹顶与城墙的庞然轮廓。脚边是铺满铜绿色卷曲草甸的平地，其间点缀着如活眼般转动的诡谲花朵。不远处有片果树般的密林，繁茂叶丛中垂坠着无数暗红色果实。平原上杳无人迹，炽热空气中不见飞鸟，唯闻树叶沙沙作响，恍若无数隐蛇的嘶声。\n\n对来自焦枯山地的少年而言，这无疑是未经品鉴的伊甸园。但周遭超自然的诡谲生机令他踌躇：火星在涟漪空气中飘落消融；草叶如蛆虫般蠕动；花眼死死凝视着他；树冠脉动仿佛流淌着代替树液的猩红灵浆；林间蛇嘶般的声响愈发尖锐。\n\n克希特拉只担心这丰美之地或有忌惮入侵者的主人。他谨慎扫视无人平原，确认安全后，终于屈服于对那些艳红果实的渴望。\n\n当他奔向最近那棵树时，脚下草甸如活物般富有弹性。沉甸甸的闪亮果实压弯枝头垂在他周围。他采下几枚最硕大的果子藏进破旧束腰外衣，随即迫不及待地啃食起来。果皮在齿间轻易破裂，甘醇如御酒般的汁液溢满口腔。喉间与胸膛腾起的灼热几乎令他窒息，奇异的狂热在耳畔嗡鸣，扰乱神智。这感觉稍纵即逝，空中突然传来的话语声将他惊醒。\n\n他立刻明白这绝非人声。那声音如不祥鼓点般在耳中轰鸣，夹杂着凶险回响，虽说着陌生语言却字字清晰。透过浓密枝桠望去，眼前的恐怖景象令他血液凝固——两个如山地瞭望塔般巍峨的巨人，腰部以上高耸于树冠之上。他们仿佛自绿地或金天中幻化而出，因为以他们庞然身躯，周遭植被本不可能遮蔽其形迹。\n\n巨人披挂着无光的漆黑铠甲，恍若侍奉无底深渊之主萨赛顿的恶魔。克希特拉确信他们已看见自己，那晦涩对话或许正关乎他的闯入。想到自己可能擅闯了精灵花园，他不禁战栗。从藏身处恐惧地窥视，他看不清黑暗头盔下的面容，唯见黄红斑驳如沼泽鬼火般的眼状光点，在应是面孔的虚空阴影中游移不定。\n\n繁茂枝叶似乎无法阻挡巨人的审视目光。窸窣树叶、巨人的鼓声般话语、眼状花朵——这一切仿佛都在控诉他的入侵与偷窃。同时，他陷入对自身身份的诡异困惑：此刻的他似乎不再是牧羊少年克希特拉...而是某个...发现光明花园并啖食血红色果实的陌生人。这个异化的自我没有名字或记忆，唯有混乱光影与模糊低语在意识阴影中闪烁。果实带来的灼热与狂热再次席卷全身。\n\n一道惨白闪光劈开枝叶向他袭来，将他从迷惘中惊醒。那或许是晴空霹雳，亦或是铠甲巨人挥舞的巨剑——事后他始终无法确定。强光灼伤了他的视线，在失控的惊惧中，他半盲地狂奔过开阔草地。在旋转的色斑间，他看见来时的洞口嵌在陡峭无顶的绝壁上。身后传来悠长轰鸣，似夏日惊雷...又似巨人的狞笑。\n\n克希特拉顾不上拾取洞口仍在燃烧的火把，仓皇钻入黑暗洞穴。在冥河般的漆黑中，他艰难攀爬险坡，跌跌撞撞满身淤伤，终于回到辛科尔群山背后的隐秘山谷。\n\n令他惊恐的是，洞外世界已入暮色。狰狞岩壁上方繁星密布，褪色的紫罗兰色天幕被象牙月亮的尖角刺穿。既惧怕巨人追兵，又担忧波诺斯的怒火，克希特拉匆忙赶回小潭，集合羊群踏上漫长的归途。\n\n归途中，间歇发作的怪异高热带来种种幻象。他忘却了对波诺斯的恐惧，甚至忘记了自己是卑微的牧羊少年克希特拉。此刻他要返回的绝非波诺斯的破败茅屋，而是一座穹顶高耸的城池——抛光的金属城门将为他洞开，火色旌旗将在香风中招展，银号角与金发宫女、黑肤侍卫的欢呼将迎接他这位千柱厅堂的君王。古老王权的荣光将如空气阳光般环绕着他，新登基的阿梅罗国王将如先祖般统治东方海滨的卡利兹王国。南方部落将骑着蓬松骆驼进献椰枣酒与沙漠蓝宝石，黎明之外岛屿的商船将满载半年度贡的香料与异色织物泊满码头...\n\n这些如谵妄般涌现又消散的幻象清晰如日常记忆。当幻象褪去，他再度变回波诺斯的侄儿，赶着迟归的羊群。\n\n当克希特拉回到波诺斯的粗木羊圈时，赤红月轮如利刃般刺入阴沉山峦。果然，老人正提着陶土灯笼，手持荆棘木棍在圈门等候。他挥舞木棍，以半癫狂的暴怒咒骂少年，威胁要责打他的迟归。\n\n克希特拉并未退缩。幻象中他再度成为卡利兹的年轻君王阿梅罗。在摇晃的灯笼光下，他困惑地望着眼前散发恶臭的陌生老朽，几乎听不懂波诺斯的言语。老人的愤怒只令他困惑而非恐惧，山羊的膻味刺激着他仿佛只习惯幽香的鼻孔。他如初闻般听着疲惫羊群的咩叫，惊愕地瞪着柳条围栏与远处的茅屋。\n\n\"我含辛茹苦养大妹妹的孤儿就为这个？\"波诺斯咆哮道，\"该死的月痴！忘恩负义的崽子！要是少了一只奶羊或羊羔，我非活剥了你的皮不可！\"\n\n见少年沉默不语，波诺斯以为他在倔强，便挥棍抽打。第一棍落下时，克希特拉脑中的迷云骤然消散。他敏捷地躲开荆棘棍，试图向波诺斯描述山中新发现的草场。老人停手后，他又说起那个通向神秘花园的奇异洞窟。为佐证自己的故事，他伸手入怀想取出偷来的血红苹果——却震惊地发现果实已不翼而飞，不知是遗失在黑暗中，还是因其内在的巫术而消失。\n\n波诺斯频频呵斥着打断少年，起初全然不信。但随着叙述深入，他逐渐沉默。当故事讲完，老人颤抖着喊道：\n\n\"今日大凶！你闯进了妖境。这山里根本不存在你说的水潭，这季节也不可能有这等草场。这些都是诱你迷失的幻象，那洞窟绝非善地，而是直通地狱的入口。先祖曾言，七重地下世界之王萨赛顿的花园就在这地界浅处。这类洞窟会如门扉般开启，凡人误入花园受果实诱惑而食之，终将陷入疯狂与永劫——恶魔从不会忘记每一颗被窃的苹果，终将索取代价。糟了！糟了！羊群吃了妖草场的草，产下的奶整整一个月都会发酸！白养你这饭桶这么多年，看来我得另找牧童了！\"\n\n当那团燃烧的云再度笼罩希斯拉时，他困惑地说道：\"老者，我与你素不相识。\"随后他用宫廷式的优雅言辞——这些话语对波诺斯而言仅能半懂不懂地继续说道：\"我似乎迷失了方向。请问卡里兹王国位于何处？我乃该国新王，刚在沙赛尔高城加冕，我的先祖已统治那片土地千年之久。\"\n\n\"唉！唉！\"波诺斯哀叹道，\"这孩子疯了。定是吃了恶魔苹果才生出这些妄想。别再胡言乱语，快来帮我挤羊奶。你不过是我妹妹阿斯克利的孩子，十九年前她丈夫乌索斯死于痢疾后生下你。阿斯克利早逝，是我波诺斯将你抚养成人，这些山羊就是你的乳母。\"\n\n\"我必须找到我的王国，\"希斯拉固执地说，\"我迷失在黑暗中，周遭尽是粗鄙之物，全然不记得如何流落至此。老者，望你赐我食宿一夜。黎明时分我将沿着东方大道前往沙赛尔。\"\n\n波诺斯颤抖着喃喃自语，举起陶土灯笼照向少年的脸庞。站在他面前的仿佛是个陌生人，那双睁大的困惑眼眸里竟映着金色灯火的辉光。希斯拉举止间毫无狂乱之态，只有某种温和的骄傲与疏离；他穿着破旧束腰外衣的姿态带着奇特的优雅。但老人认定他神志失常——因其言行实在难以理解。波诺斯低声嘟囔着，不再强求少年帮忙，转身继续挤奶......\n\n* * *\n\n希斯拉在苍白的黎明早早醒来，惊愕地环视着这间自出生起就居住的泥墙陋室。一切对他而言都陌生而费解；尤其令他困扰的是粗糙的衣物与被烈日晒黑的皮肤：这些与他认为自己应该是的年轻国王阿梅罗实在相去甚远。处境完全无法解释，他感到必须立即启程返乡。\n\n他轻轻从当作床铺的干草堆中起身。角落里的波诺斯仍在衰老的酣眠中，希斯拉小心不去惊醒他。这个令人不悦的老者昨晚用粗粝的粟米面包、腥膻的山羊奶与奶酪招待他，让他栖身于恶臭的茅屋，这既令他困惑又使他厌恶。他几乎没留意波诺斯的咕哝与咒骂；但显然老人不仅质疑他宣称的王室身份，更对他究竟是谁怀有古怪的妄想。\n\n离开茅屋后，希斯拉沿着石丘间向东蜿蜒的小径前行。他不知此路通向何方，但推断卡里兹作为佐西克大陆最东端的王国，必在旭日之下的某处。在他想象的视野中，王国的翠绿山谷如美丽幻景般浮动，沙赛尔高耸的圆顶宛如东方堆积的朝云。他认定这些是昨日的记忆。虽不记得离乡缘由，但他确信统治的疆土并不遥远。\n\n小径在渐矮的山脊间转折，希斯拉来到名为西斯的小村庄，这里的居民都认识他。此刻这地方对他却如此陌生，不过是阳光下散发着腐臭的肮脏棚屋围成的圆圈。人们聚拢过来直呼其名，当询问通往卡里兹的道路时，他们呆笑着瞪视他。似乎无人知晓这个王国或沙赛尔城的存在。注意到希斯拉举止异常，认定他提问如同疯人呓语，众人开始嘲弄他。孩童用干土块与碎石投掷他；就这样他被逐出西斯，沿着一条东向道路前行——那是从辛科尔通往泽尔国低地的商道。\n\n怀着对失落王国的幻象，这青年在佐西克大陆流浪了数月之久。每当他提及王权或询问卡里兹时总遭人讥笑；但许多人视疯狂为神圣，给予他食宿庇护。他穿越泽尔绵延的丰饶葡萄园，踏入万城之都伊斯塔南；翻越初秋便积雪皑皑的伊莫斯高山口；横跨迪尔盐白的荒漠——希斯拉始终追随着那个辉煌的帝国幻梦，这已成为他仅存的记忆。他永远向东而行，时而加入商队（旅人们指望疯子的陪伴能带来好运），更多时候则是独行。\n\n偶尔在短暂片刻，幻梦会离他而去，他变回单纯的牧羊人，迷失在异域，思念着辛科尔的荒芜山丘。但很快他又记起自己的王权，沙赛尔富丽的花园与骄傲的宫殿，以及父王埃尔达马克驾崩后，那些侍奉他继位者的名字与面容。\n\n仲冬时分，在遥远的沙-卡拉格城，希斯拉遇到几位来自乌斯泰姆的护符商人。当他询问通往卡里兹的方向时，商人们露出古怪笑容。听闻他自称国王，他们交换着眼色告诉他：卡里兹位于沙-卡拉格以东数百里格，就在朝阳之下。\n\n\"向您致敬，陛下，\"他们以嘲弄的礼节说道，\"愿您在沙赛尔长治久安。\"\n\n希斯拉欣喜若狂——这是首次有人证实失落王国的存在，证明那不仅是疯狂幻梦。他片刻不愿耽搁，立即全速启程......\n\n当春月初现如纤弱银钩悬于暮空时，他知道目的地近了。因为老人星正在东方天穹璀璨闪耀，周围群星黯然——正如他曾在沙赛尔宫墙上所见那般。\n\n归乡的喜悦令他心跳加速；但途经之地的蛮荒贫瘠又使他惊愕。似乎没有旅人往返于卡里兹；偶遇的几个游牧民见他靠近便如荒野兽类般逃窜。大道杂草与仙人掌丛生，只有冬雨留下的车辙印。路旁时而可见雕刻成跃立雄狮的界石——那曾是卡里兹西陲的标记。狮像面容已风化剥落，爪身覆满青苔，仿佛历经漫长荒芜岁月。希斯拉心头涌起寒意：若记忆无误，去年此时他还与父王埃尔达马克骑马经过此狮像猎杀鬣狗，当时石雕明明崭新如初。\n\n此刻站在边境高崖上，他俯瞰本应如翠绿长卷铺展海边的卡里兹。令他惊骇的是，广袤田野如经秋霜般枯黄；河流细若游丝消逝于沙中；山峦嶙峋似未裹尸布的干尸肋骨；除沙漠春日偶现的零星草叶外再无绿意。远处紫罗兰色的海平线上，他仿佛望见了沙赛尔大理石穹顶的闪光；唯恐王国遭敌咒侵蚀，他急忙向城市奔去。\n\n在令人心碎的春日里穿行时，他发现荒漠已建立其统治。田野空荡，村落无人。农舍坍塌成粪堆般的废墟；仿佛千季旱灾摧残了丰饶果园，只余焦黑朽烂的树桩。\n\n暮色中他进入曾被誉为东方海域白色情人的沙赛尔。街道与港湾同样空寂，破碎的屋顶与倾颓的墙垣沉浸在静默中。青铜方尖碑覆满古老铜绿；卡里兹众神的宏伟大理石神庙倾斜欲坠。\n\n希斯拉如惧于证实预料般迟缓地走向王宫。记忆里被杏花、香木与喷泉半掩的壮丽大理石宫殿，如今在枯萎花园中以赤裸的废墟姿态迎接他。短暂虚幻的夕照玫瑰色掠过穹顶，将其染得如陵墓般惨白。\n\n此地荒芜了多久，他无从知晓。困惑与彻底绝望淹没了他。废墟中似乎无人迎接；但走近西翼门廊时，他看见阴影如从柱廊深处剥离般飘忽晃动；几个裹着腐布的模糊形体沿着龟裂地砖向他匍匐爬行。移动时褴褛布片不断剥落；他们周身笼罩着污秽、肮脏与疾病构成的不可名状恐怖。靠近后希斯拉发现他们大多残缺不全，全都被麻风病侵蚀得面目全非。\n\n他胃部翻涌无法言语。但麻风病人们却以嘶哑呼喊迎接他，仿佛认为他是来废墟同住的另一个流浪者。\n\n\"寄居在我沙赛尔王宫的究竟是何人？\"他终于发问，\"看啊！我是阿梅罗王，埃尔达马克之子，远行归来重掌卡里兹王权。\"\n\n麻风病人群中爆发出可憎的咯咯笑声。\"我们才是卡里兹的国王，\"其中一人告诉青年，\"这片土地已成荒漠数百年，沙赛尔城早无居民，除了我们这些被别处驱逐的贱民。年轻人，欢迎与我们共享王国：在这里多一个或少一个国王无关紧要。\"\n\n麻风病人以淫邪的狂笑嘲弄着希斯拉；站在梦想黑暗碎片中的他无言以对。唯有一个几乎失去四肢与面容的最年长者没有参与嘲笑，似乎在沉思。最终他用从黑洞般口腔里发出的浑浊声音对希斯拉说：\n\n\"我略知卡里兹历史，阿梅罗与埃尔达马克的名字确有耳闻。往昔某些统治者确有此名；但分不清谁为父谁为子。恐怕他们都与王朝其他成员长眠于宫殿下的深窖里。\"\n\n暮色渐沉，更多麻风病人从阴影废墟中冒出围住希斯拉。听闻他宣称对这个荒漠王国拥有主权，几人离去后很快端着腐水与霉食返回，如内臣侍奉君主般卑躬屈膝地献上。\n\n尽管饥渴交加，希斯拉仍厌恶地转身逃离。他穿过灰烬花园，经过干涸的喷泉口与积尘的花坛。身后麻风病人的狞笑逐渐微弱，似乎并未追赶。绕行巨大宫殿时再未遇见这些生物。南翼与东翼的门廊漆黑空荡，但他不愿进入——深知那里唯有荒芜与比荒芜更可怕的存在。\n\n在彻底崩溃与绝望中，他来到东翼停驻于幽暗中。迟钝而恍惚地意识到自己正站在记忆中无数次浮现的海边露台上。古老花床光秃荒芜；盆栽树木已在凹陷石槽中朽烂；地砖裂隙纵横。但暮色温柔地笼罩着废墟；紫色雾霭下海浪如昔叹息；雄伟的老人星在东方升起，周围群星依旧黯淡。\n\n泽斯拉的心头充满苦涩，自认是被虚妄幻梦蛊惑的痴人。他畏缩着避开天狼星的璀璨光芒，仿佛那烈焰过于灼目；但未及转身，一道比夜色更幽暗、比云翳更浓稠的阴影之柱已从露台拔地而起，遮蔽了那颗辉煌星辰。阴影自坚实石面生长，巍峨如山岳，渐次化作披甲武士的轮廓。那武士从头盔阴影中俯视泽斯拉，双目如暗夜里滚动的火球。\n\n恍如追忆旧梦般，泽斯拉依稀记起那个在焦灼山丘牧羊的男孩。某日男孩发现一处洞窟，门扉般敞向奇异瑰丽的秘境。他采食了暗红如血的果实，又在黑甲巨人的追逐下仓皇逃窜。此刻他既是那个牧童，又是跋涉千里寻找失落王国的阿梅罗国王——最终寻得的，唯有满目荒芜。\n\n当牧羊人因偷窃与擅入产生的战栗，与君王的骄傲在他灵魂中交锋时，苍穹传来雷霆般的轰鸣：\n\n\"吾乃萨赛顿使者。凡穿越幽冥之门啖食园中果实者，主上皆遣吾如期而至。此果将改变所有食者：或赐遗忘，或予记忆。须知汝前世正是年轻的阿梅罗王。这段记忆如此强烈，竟抹去现世经历，驱使汝追寻古老王权。\"\n\n\"若此言非虚，我便遭逢双重剥夺。\"泽斯拉向阴影悲叹，\"身为阿梅罗，我失去王座与疆土；作为泽斯拉，又无法忘却昔日荣光重获牧童的满足。\"\n\n\"且听另一条路。\"阴影低语如远海呢喃，\"萨赛顿乃万法之主，愿将魔法馈赠效忠者。汝若立誓臣服，恶魔必赐回报。他可凭死灵术唤醒尘封过往。汝将重掌卡里兹，万物皆复旧观，荒原再绽生机。\"\n\n\"我立此契。\"泽斯拉宣告，\"向萨赛顿效忠，献上灵魂以换王国。\"\n\n\"未尽之言。\"阴影续道，\"汝仅忆起与现世年岁相仿的片段。若为君时再生悔意，忘却王者天职，法术便将如烟消散。\"\n\n\"此约亦受。\"泽斯拉应答。\n\n语毕，遮天狼星的阴影已然消隐。星辰重绽清辉，恍若从未被遮蔽。观星者倏然化为阿梅罗王，牧童泽斯拉、恶魔使者与黑暗誓约皆似从未存在。沙赛尔的倾覆不过是狂人的谵妄预言——阿梅罗鼻端萦绕着倦怠花香与海洋香脂的混合气息，耳畔庄严海涛间穿插着竖琴的旖旎哀音与身后宫阙传来的侍女尖笑。夜都的喧嚣欢宴声中，他转身离开星辰，带着神秘痛楚与幽暗欢欣，望见父王宫殿的灿烂窗扉，万千火炬的辉光直冲霄汉，令群星黯然失色。\n\n古卷记载阿梅罗王统治多年。卡里兹风调雨顺，沙漠旱魃不至，海疆风暴平息，属国岁贡如期。君王沉醉于锦绣华堂，纵情宴饮，聆听乐师、侍臣与宠姬的谄媚。\n\n盛年过后，倦怠如影随形。他时而去寻找花草古诗的慰藉，暂缓餍足之感。因治国之责尚轻，王权仍是美事。\n\n直至某年深秋，灾星降兆卡里兹。瘟疫如无形恶龙展翼，海盗战船肆虐海岸，西方商旅遭悍匪劫掠，南疆村落被沙漠部族侵袭。举国哀鸿遍野。\n\n面对每日呈报的噩耗，缺乏治国经验的君王从廷臣处所得尽是谬策。灾祸愈演愈烈：荒原部族日益猖獗，海盗群聚若海鹫。饥荒与瘟疫瓜分国土，王冠重若千钧。\n\n为忘却无能，他彻夜纵欲。但醇酒失效，欢爱无味。遂召来异域艺人：吟唱巫歌的永生诗人，跳淫靡之舞的琥珀纹身北地女郎，吹奏奇兽号角的乐师，以食人族皮制鼓的蛮族鼓手，披半神话兽皮的杂耍者——皆不能解其忧思。\n\n某日午后，粗布裹身的牧笛手入宫觐见。此人眼如炽炭，面若焦炭，不卑不亢道：\"吾通遗忘之曲，不为赏金而奏。若成，他日自取报酬。\"\n\n芦笛声起，恍若幽谷流泉，孤峰过风。乐声诉说七重紫霭外的自由净土，那里岁月如花瓣履般轻柔，尘世纷扰消弭于无垠静默。听着听着，阿梅罗恍见阳光遍洒的魔法山谷，自己化作牧童徜徉绿径，忘却秃鹫时刻。\n\n\"继续！\"曲终时君王大喊，\"酬劳任取。\"\n\n牧人暮色中的双眸灼灼：\"待沧海桑田，王国倾覆，吾方索酬。\"复又吹奏。\n\n魔法笛声整日蛊惑着国王。宫阙辉煌渐成窒碍，王权令人憎恶。黄昏时分，他遣退侍从，对笛手道：\"带我去那片遗忘之地。\"\n\n乔装的君王随笛手潜出宫门。新月如兽角低垂的暗夜笼罩城外，而街衢火炬通明。他们穿过抬疫病死者的担架与饥民幽怨的目光——这些皆不入君王之眼，他心中唯余时光浊流外那片翠谷。\n\n忽有幽暗降临。街灯明灭，市声消隐。巍峨宫室如梦境溃散，废墟间唯见残垣断壁的星空。阿梅罗只觉寒意彻骨，恍如历经漫长空虚岁月，此刻站在衰朽的尽头。鼻腔充斥古墟夜气，他蓦然惊觉：沙漠已吞噬了骄傲的沙赛尔。\n\n\"汝引我至何处？\"阿梅罗向笛手厉声质问。\n\n作为回应，他只听见一阵嘲弄的雷霆般笑声。牧羊人那模糊的身影在幽暗中巍然耸立，不断扭曲膨胀，直至轮廓化作身披玄甲的高大武士。阿梅罗脑海中翻涌着诡谲记忆，朦胧间仿佛忆起了另一段人生......不知何时何地，他确曾是自己梦中那个心满意足、无忧无虑的牧羊人......不知何时何地，他踏入过一座奇异的光明花园，啜食过暗红如血的果实......\n\n当地狱之火般的电光闪过，他突然全数忆起，认出了那道如冥界界碑般矗立在前的可怖阴影。脚下是海岬露台龟裂的石板，使者头顶的星辰仍是老人星显现前的星群，但老人星本身已被恶魔的肩膀遮蔽。在尘封的黑暗深处，某个麻风病人边咳嗽边发出浑浊笑声，逡巡在这座卡里兹诸王曾居住的倾颓宫殿周围。自与地狱势力达成交易使亡国复现以来，万物皆保持着原初的模样。\n\n赛斯拉感到焚尸炉灰烬与废墟残骸般的痛苦扼住了心脏。恶魔以千般诡计引诱他走向毁灭。这些究竟是梦境、死灵法术还是现实，他无从确知；亦不知是单次还是多次重演。最终只余尘埃与荒芜，而他这个遭双重诅咒之人，将永远铭记并忏悔所丧失的一切。\n\n他向使者哭喊：\"我违背了与萨赛顿的契约。此刻就带走我的灵魂，送往他那永燃铜座之前吧，我愿彻底履行誓约。\"\n\n\"无需带走你的灵魂。\"使者的声音如同荒原夜空中渐远的闷雷，\"随你与麻风病人同住，或回到波诺斯与羊群身边皆可，这无关紧要。无论何时何地，你的灵魂永远属于萨赛顿的黑暗帝国。\""

        "content": "\n\nThe world itself, in the end, shall be turned to a round cipher.\n\n-Old prophecy of Zothique\n\nIn the Book of Vergama\n\nIt was said of Vergama, in the lattermost ages, that he had existed immortally ever since the lifting of Zothique from the foundered ruins of continents that history had forgotten. Always, throughout the wide realms and empires of the continent, there had been rumors of Vergama, and various beliefs about his identity, his essence, his birth-place and dwelling-place. The sages disputed learnedly whether he was demon, god, sorcerer, phantom, or a being from worlds whose inhabitants were not akin to any of these. Likewise they debated whether he dwelt in mummy-peopled Cincor, or amid the stark fearful mountains of northern Xylac, or in Naat, isle of evil gramaries lying shrouded with the mist and foam of the sunset ocean, or in some other kingdom or sea-lost island.\n\nNo idols were wrought in the image of Vergama, no altars were dedicated to him: yet sometimes he was addressed in prayer by savage peoples, or was called upon with-dark runic formulae by the more venturous wizards. Some claimed that the prayers and the incantations were answered; but this, like all else that concerned Vergama, was a matter of much doubt. Curious and almost omnipotent powers were ascribed to him, and attributes of tremendous bale and benignity; but there was no virtual proof of their manifestation at any time. In a land of murky enchantments, of multiform mysteries, Vergama resided unknown, occult, and apart. It was believed that vast multitudes of people had entered his secret house through the centuries and millenniums; but none had returned there from to declare the actual nature of Vergama and the situation of his abode. Certain prophets, appearing in the ultimate years, avowed that he was coeval with life and death, and was the first and the last of the uncreated gods.\n\nEven till the ending of time, weird legends gathered about Vergama; and there were divers tales of the destinies of them that passed into his shadowy mansion; and much was fabled concerning a volume called the Book of Hieroglyphics, which belonged to this inscrutable entity. Among such tales and fablings, there is the story of what happened to Nushain, the astrologer.\n\nNushain the astrologer had studied the circling orbs of night from many far-separated regions, and had cast, with such skill as he was able to command, the horoscopes of a myriad men, women and children. From city to city, from realm to realm he had gone, abiding briefly in any place: for often the local magistrates had banished him as a common charlatan; or elsewise, in due time, his consultants had discovered the error of his predictions and had fallen away from him. Sometimes he went hungry and shabby; and small honor was paid to him anywhere. The sole companions of his precarious fortunes were a wretched mongrel dog that had somehow attached itself to him in the desert town of Zul-Bha-Sair, and a mute, one-eyed negro whom he had bought very cheaply on Yoros. He had named the dog Ansarath, after the canine star, and had called the Negro Mouzda, which was a word signifying darkness.\n\nIn the course of his prolonged itinerations, the astrologer came to Xylac and made his abode in its capital, Ummaos, which had been built above the shards of an elder city of the same name, long since destroyed by a sorcerer's wrath. Here Nushain lodged with Ansarath and Mouzda in a half-ruinous attic of a rotting tenement; and from the tenement's roof, Nushain was wont to observe the positions and movements of the sidereal bodies on evenings not obscured by the fumes of the city. At intervals some housewife or jade, some porter or huckster or petty merchant, would climb the decaying stairs to his chamber, and would pay him a small sum for the nativity which he plotted with immense care by the aid of his tattered books of astrological science.\n\nWhen, as often occurred, he found himself still at a loss regarding the significance of some heavenly conjunction or opposition after poring over his books, he would consult Ansarath, and would draw profound auguries from the variable motions of the dog's mangy tail or his actions in searching for fleas. Certain of these divinations were fulfilled, to the considerable benefit of Nushain's renown in Ummaos. People came to him more freely and frequently, hearing that he was a soothsayer of some note; and, moreover, he was immune from prosecution, owing to the liberal laws of Xylac, which permitted all the sorcerous and mantic arts.\n\nIt seemed, for the first time, that the dark planets of his fate were yielding to auspicious stars. For this fortune, and the coins which accrued thereby to his purse, he gave thanks to Vergama who, throughout the whole continent of Zothique, was deemed the most powerful and mysterious of the genii, and was thought to rule over the heavens as well as the earth.\n\nOn a summer night, when the stars were strewn thickly like a firey sand on the black azure vault, Nushain went up to the roof of his lodging-place. As was often his custom, he took with him the negro Mouzda, whose one eye possessed a miraculous sharpness and had served well, on many occasions, to supplement the astrologer's own rather near-sighted vision. Through a well codified system of signs and gestures, the mute was able to communicate the result of his observations to Nushain.\n\nOn this night the constellation of the Great Dog, which had presided over Nushain's birth, was ascendant in the east. Regarding it closely, the dim eyes of the astrologer were troubled by a sense of something unfamiliar in its configuration. He could not determine the precise character of the change till Mouzda, who evinced much excitement, called his attention to three new stars of the second magnitude which had appeared in close proximity to the Dog's hindquarters. These remarkable novae, which Nushain could discern only as three reddish blurs, formed a small equilateral triangle. Nushain and Mouzda were both certain that they had not been visible on any previous evening.\n\n\"By Vergama, this is a strange thing,\" swore the astrologer, filled with amazement and dumbfoundment. He began to compute the problematic influence of the novae on his future reading of the heavens, and perceived at once that they would exert, according to the law of astral emanations, a modifying effect on his own destiny, which had been so largely controlled by the Dog.\n\nHe could not, however, without consulting his books and tables, decide the particular trend and import of this supervening influence; though he felt sure that it was most momentous, whether for his bale or welfare. Leaving Mouzda to watch the heavens for other prodigies, he descended at once to his attic. There, after collating the opinions of several old-time astrologers on the power exerted by novae, he began to recast his own horoscope. Painfully and with much agitation he labored throughout the night, and did not finish his figurings till the dawn came to mix a deathly grayness with the yellow light of the candles.\n\nThere was, it seemed, but one possible interpretation of the altered heavens. The appearance of the triangle of novae in conjunction with the Dog signified clearly that Nushain was to start ere long on an unpremeditated journey which would involve the transit of no less than three elements. Mouzda and Ansarath were to accompany him; and three guides, appearing successively, at the proper times, would lead him toward a destined goal. So much his calculations had revealed, but no more: there was nothing to foretell whether the journey would prove auspicious or disastrous, nothing to indicate its bourn, purpose or direction.\n\nThe astrologer was much disturbed by this somewhat singular and equivocal augury. He was ill-pleased by the prospect of an imminent journey, for he did not wish to leave Ummaos, among whose credulous people he had begun to establish himself not without success. Moreover, a strong apprehension was roused within him by the oddly manifold nature and veiled outcome of the journey. All this, he felt, was suggestive of the workings of some occult and perhaps sinister providence; and surely it was no common traveling which would take him through three elements and would require a triple guidance.\n\nDuring the nights that followed, he and Mouzda watched the mysterious novae as they went over toward the west behind the bright-flaming Dog. And he puzzled interminably over his charts and volumes hoping to discover some error in the reading he had made. But always, in the end, he was compelled to the same interpretation.\n\nMore and more, as time went on, he was troubled by the thought of that unwelcome and mysterious journey which he must make. He continued to prosper in Ummaos, and it seemed that there was no conceivable reason for his departure from that city. He was as one who awaited a dark and secret summons; not knowing whence it would come, nor at what hour. Throughout the days, he scanned with fearful anxiety the faces of his visitors, deeming that the first of the three star-predicted guides might arrive unheralded and unrecognized among them.\n\nMouzda and the dog Ansarath, with the intuition of dumb things, were sensible of the weird uneasiness felt by their master. They shared it palpably, the negro showing his apprehension by wild and demoniac grimaces, and the dog crouching under the astrologer's table or prowling restlessly to and fro with his half-hairless tail between his legs. Such behavior, in its turn, served to reconfirm the inquietude of Nushain, who deemed it a bad omen.\n\nOn a certain evening, Nushain pored for the fiftieth time over his horoscope, which he had drawn with sundry-colored inks on a sheet of papyrus. He was much startled when, on the blank lower margin of the sheet, he saw a curious character which was no part of his own scribbling. The character was a hieroglyph written in dark bituminous brown, and seeming to represent a mummy whose shroudings were loosened about the legs and whose feet were set in the posture of a long stride. It was facing toward that quarter of the chart where stood the sign indicating the Great Dog, which, in Zothique, was a House of the zodiac.\n\nNushain's surprise turned to a sort of trepidation as he studied the heiroglyph. He knew that the margin of the chart had been wholly clear on the previous night; and during the past day he had not left the attic at any time. Mouzda, he felt sure, would never have dared to touch the chart; and, moreover, the negro was little skilled in writing. Among the various inks employed by Nushain, there was none that resembled the sullen brown of the character, which seemed to stand out in a sad relief on the white papyrus.\n\nNushain felt the alarm of one who confronts a sinister and unexplainable apparition. No human hand, surely, had inscribed the mummy-shapen character, like the sign of a strange outer planet about to invade the Houses of his horoscope. Here, as in the advent of the three novae, an occult agency was suggested. Vainly, for many hours, he sought to unriddle the mystery: but in all his books there was naught to enlighten him; for this thing, it seemed, was wholly without precedent in astrology.\n\nDuring the next day he was busied from morn till eve with the plotting of those destinies ordained by the heavens for certain people of Ummaos. After completing the calculations with his usual toilsome care, he unrolled his own chart once more, albeit with trembling fingers. An eeriness that was nigh to panic seized him when he saw that the brown hieroglyph no longer stood on the margin, but was now placed like a striding figure in one of the lower Houses, where it still fronted toward the Dog, as if advancing on that ascendant sign.\n\nHenceforth the astrologer was fevered with the awe and curiosity of one who watches a fatal but inscrutable portent. Never, during the hours that he pondered above it, was there any change in the intruding character; and yet, on each successive evening when he took out the chart, he saw that the mummy had strode upward into a higher House, drawing always nearer to the House of the Dog....\n\nThere came a time when the figure stood on the Dog's threshold. Portentous with mystery and menace that were still beyond the astrologer's divining, it seemed to wait while the night wore on and was shot through with the grey wefting of dawn. Then, overworn with his prolonged studies and vigils, Nushain slept in his chair. Without the troubling of any dream he slept; and Mouzda was careful not to disturb him; and no visitors came to the attic on that day. So the morn and the noon and the afternoon went over, and their going was unheeded by Nushain.\n\nHe was awakened at eve by the loud and dolorous howling of Ansarath, which appeared to issue from the room's farthest corner. Confusedly, ere he opened his eyes, he became aware of an odor of bitter spices and piercing natron. Then, with the dim webs of sleep not wholly swept from his vision, he beheld, by the yellowy tapers that Mouzda had lighted, a tall, mummy-like form that waited in silence beside him. The head, arms and body of the shape were wound closely with bitumen-colored cerements; but the folds were loosened from the hips downward, and the figure stood like a walker, with one brown, withered foot in advance of its fellow.\n\nTerror quickened in Nushain's heart, and it came to him that the shrouded shape, whether lich or phantom, resembled the weird, invasive hieroglyph that had passed from House to House through the chart of his destiny. Then, from the thick swathings of the apparition, a voice issued indistinctly, saying: \"Prepare yourself, O Nushain, for I am the first guide of that journey which was foretold to you by the stars.\"\n\nAnsarath, cowering beneath the astrologer's bed, was still howling his fear of the visitant; and Nushain saw that Mouzda had tried to conceal himself in company with the dog. Though a chill as of imminent death was upon him, and he deemed the apparition to be death itself, Nushain arose from the chair with that dignity proper to an astrologer, which he had maintained through all the vicissitudes of his lifetime. He called Mouzda and Ansarath from their hiding-place, and the two obeyed him, though with many cringings before the dark, muffled mummy.\n\nWith the comrades of his fortune behind him, Nushain turned to the visitant. \"I am ready,\" he said, in a voice whose quavering was almost imperceptible. \"But I would like with me certain of my belongings.\"\n\nThe mummy shook his mobled head. \"It were well to take with you nothing but your horoscope: for this alone shall you retain in the end.\"\n\nNushain stooped above the table on which he had left his nativity. Before he began to roll the open papyrus, he noticed that the hieroglyph of the mummy had vanished. It was as if the written symbol, after moving athwart his horoscope, had materialized itself in the figure that now attended him. But on the chart's nether margin, in remote opposition to the Dog, was the sea-blue heiroglyph of a quaint merman with carp-like tail and head half human, half apish; and behind the merman was the black hieroglyph of a small barge.\n\nNushain's fear, for a moment, was subdued by wonder. But he rolled the chart carefully, and stood holding it in his right hand.\n\n\"Come,\" said the guide. \"Your time is brief, and you must pass through the three elements that guard the dwelling place of Vergama from unseasonable intrusion.\"\n\nThese words, in a measure, confirmed the astrologer's divinations. But the mystery of his future fate was in no wise lightened by the intimation that he must enter, presumably at the journey's end, the dim House of that being called Vergama, whom some considered the most secret of all the gods, and others, the most cryptical of demons. In all the lands of Zothique, there were rumors and fables regarding Vergama; but these were wholly diverse and contradictory, except in their common attribution of almost omnipotent powers to this entity. No man knew the situation of his abode; but it was believed that vast multitudes of people had entered it during the centuries and millenniums, and that none had returned therefrom.\n\nOfttimes had Nushain called upon the name of Vergama, swearing or protesting thereby as men are wont to do by the cognomens of their shrouded lords. But now, hearing the name from the lips of his macabre visitor, he was filled with the darkest and most eerie apprehensions. He sought to subdue these feelings, and to resign himself to the manifest will of the stars. With Mouzda and Ansarath at his heels, he followed the striding mummy, which seemed little hampered, if at all, by its trailing cerements.\n\nWith one regretful backward glance at his littered books and papers, he passed from the attic room and down the tenement stairs. A wannish light seemed to cling about the swathings of the mummy; but, apart from this, there was no illumination; and Nushain thought that the house was strangely dark and silent, as if all its occupants had died or had gone away. He heard no sound from the evening city; nor could he see aught but close-encroaching darkness beyond the windows that should have gazed on a little street. Also, it seemed that the stairs had changed and lengthened, giving no more on the courtyard of the tenement, but plunging deviously into an unsuspected region of stifling vaults and foul, dismal, nitrous corridors.\n\nHere the air was pregnant with death, and the heart of Nushain failed him. Everywhere, in the shadow-curtained crypts and deep-shelved recesses, he felt the innumerable presence of the dead. He thought that there was a sad sighing of stirred cerements, a breath exhaled by long-stiffened cadavers, a dry clicking of lipless teeth beside him as he went. But darkness walled his vision, and he saw nothing save the luminous form of his guide, who stalked onward as if through a natal realm.\n\nIt seemed to Nushain that he passed through boundless catacombs in which were housed the mortality and corruption of all the ages. Behind him still he heard the shuffling of Mouzda, and at whiles the low, frightened whine of Ansarath; so he knew that the twain were faithful to him. But upon him, with a chill of lethal damps, there grew the horror of his surroundings; and he shrank with all the repulsion of living flesh from the shrouded thing that he followed, and those other things that mouldered round about in the fathomless gloom.\n\nHalf thinking to hearten himself by the sound of his own voice, he began to question the guide; though his tongue clove to his mouth as if palsied. \"Is it indeed Vergama, and none other, who has summoned me forth upon this journey? For what purpose has he called me? And in what land is his dwelling?\"\n\n\"Your fate has summoned you,\" said the mummy. \"In the end, at the time appointed and no sooner, you shall learn the purpose. As to your third question, you would be no wiser if I should name the region in which the house of Vergama is hidden from mortal trespass: for the land is not listed on any terrene chart, nor map of the starry heavens.\"\n\nThese answers seemed equivocal and disquieting to Nushain, who was possessed by frightful forebodings as he went deeper into the subterranean charnels. Dark, indeed, he thought, must be the goal of a journey whose first stage had led him so far amid the empire of death and corruption; and dubious, surely, was the being who had called him forth and had sent to him as the first guide a sere and shrunken mummy clad in the tomb's habiliments.\n\nNow, as he pondered these matters almost to frenzy, the shelfy walls of the catacomb before him were outlined by a dismal light, and he came after the mummy into a chamber where tall candles of black pitch in sockets of tarnished silver burned about an immense and solitary sarcophagus. Upon the blank lid and sides of the sarcophagus, as Nushain neared it, he could see neither runes nor sculptures nor hieroglyphs engraven; but seemed, from the proportions, that a giant must lie within.\n\nThe mummy passed athwart the chamber without pausing. But Nushain, seeing that the vaults beyond were full of darkness, drew back with a reluctance that he could not conquer; and though the stars had decreed his journey, it seemed to him that human flesh could go no farther. Prompted by a sudden impulse, he seized one of the heavy yard-long tapers that burned stilly about the sarcophagus; and, holding it in his left hand, with his horoscope still firmly clutched in the right, he fled with Mouzda and Ansarath on the way he had come, hoping to retrace his footsteps through the gloomy caverns and return to Ummaos by the taper's light.\n\nHe heard no sound of pursuit from the mummy. But ever, as he fled, the pitch candle, flaring wildly, revealed to him the horrors that darkness had curtained from his eyes. He saw the bones of men that were piled in repugnant confusion with those of fell monsters, and the riven sarcophagi from which protruded the half-decayed members of innominate beings; members which were neither heads nor hands nor feet. And soon the catacomb divided and redivided before him, so that he must choose his way at random, not knowing whether it would lead him back to Ummaos or into the untrod depths.\n\nPresently he came to the huge, browless skull of an uncouth creature, which reposed on the ground with upward-gazing orbits; and beyond the skull was the monster's moldly skeleton, wholly blocking the passage. Its ribs were cramped by the narrowing walls, as if it had crept there and had died in the darkness, unable to withdraw or go forward. White spiders, demon-headed and large as monkeys, had woven their webs in the hollow arches of the bones; and they swarmed out interminably as Nushain approached; and the skeleton seemed to stir and quiver as they seethed over it abhorrently and dropped to the ground before the astrologer. Behind them others poured in a countless army, crowding and mantling every ossicle. Nushain fled with his companions; and running back to the forking of the caverns, he followed another passage.\n\nHere he was not pursued by the demon spiders. But, hurrying on lest they or the mummy overtake him, he was soon halted by the rim of a great pit which filled the catacomb from wall to wall and was overwide for the leaping of man. The dog Ansarath, sniffing certain odors that arose from the pit, recoiled with a mad howling; and Nushain, holding the taper outstretched above it, discerned far down a glimmer of ripples spreading circle-wise on some unctuous black fluid; and two blood-red spots appeared to swim with a weaving motion at the center. Then he heard a hissing as of some great cauldron heated by wizard fires; and it seemed that the blackness boiled upward, mounting swiftly and evilly to overflow the pit; and the red spots, as they neared him, were like luminous eyes that gazed malignantly into his own...\n\nSo Nushain turned away in haste; and, returning upon his steps, he found the mummy awaiting him at the junction of the catacombs.\n\n\"It would seem, O Nushain, that you have doubted your own horoscope,\" said the guide, with a certain irony. \"However, even a bad astrologer, on occasion, may read the heavens aright. Obey, then, the stars that decreed your journey.\"\n\nHenceforward, Nushain followed the mummy without recalcitrance. Returning to the chamber in which stood the immense sarcophagus, he was enjoined by his guide to replace in its socket the black taper he had stolen. Without other light than the phosphorescence of the mummy's cerements, he threaded the foul gloom of those profounder ossuaries which lay beyond. At last, through caverns where a dull dawning intruded upon the shadows, he came out beneath shrouded heavens, on the shore of a wild sea that clamored in mist and cloud and spindrift. As if recoiling from the harsh air and light, the mummy drew back into the subterrane, and it said:\n\n\"Here my dominion ends, and I must leave you to await the second guide.\"\n\nStanding with the poignant sea-salt in his nostrils, with his hair and garments outblown on the gale, Nushain heard a metallic clangor, and saw that a door of rusty bronze had closed in the cavern-entrance. The beach was walled by unscalable cliffs that ran sheerly to the wave an each hand. So perforce the astrologer waited; and from the torn surf he beheld erelong the emergence of a sea-blue merman whose head was half human, half fish; and behind the merman there hove a small black barge that was not steered or moved by any visible being. At this, Nushain recalled the hieroglyphs of the sea-creature and the boat which had appeared on the margin of his nativity; and unrolling the papyrus, he saw with wonderment that the figures were both gone; and he doubted not that they had passed, like the mummy's hieroglyph, through all the zodiacal Houses, even to that House which presided over his destiny; and thence, mayhap, they had emerged into material being. But in their stead now was the burning hieroglyph of a fire-colored salamander, set opposite to the Great Dog.\n\nThe merman beckoned to him with antic gestures, grinning deeply, and showing the white serrations of his shark-like teeth. Nushain went forward and entered the barge in obedience to the signs made by the sea-creature; and Mouzda and Ansarath, in faithfulness to their master, accompanied him. Thereupon the merman swam away through the boiling surf; and the barge, as if oared and ruddered by mere enchantment, swung about forthwith, and warring smoothly against the wind and wave, was drawn straightly over that dim, unnamable ocean.\n\nHalf-seen amid rushing foam and mist, the merman swam steadily on before. Time and space were surely outpassed during that voyage; and as if he had gone beyond mortal existence, Nushain experienced neither thirst nor hunger. But it seemed that his soul drifted upon seas of strange doubt and direst alienation; and he feared the misty chaos about him even as he had feared the nighted catacombs. Often he tried to question the mer-creature concerning their destination, but received no answer. And the wind blowing from shores unguessed, and the tide flowing to unknown gulfs, were alike filled with whispers of awe and terror.\n\nNushain pondered the mysteries of his journey almost to madness; and the thought came to him that, after passing through the region of death, he was now traversing the gray limbo of uncreated things; and, thinking this, he was loath to surmise the third stage of his journey; and he dared not reflect upon the nature of its goal.\n\nAnon, suddenly, the mists were riven, and a cataract of golden rays poured down from a high-seated sun. Near at hand, to the lee of the driving barge, a tall island hove with verdurous trees and light, shell-shaped domes and blossomy gardens hanging far up in the dazzlement of noon. There, with a sleepy purling, the surf was lulled on a low, grassy shore that had not known the anger of storm; and fruited vines and full-blown flowers were pendent above the water. It seemed that a spell of oblivion and slumber was shed from the island, and that any who landed thereon would dwell inviolable for ever in sun-bright dreams. Nushain was seized with a longing for its green, flowery refuge; and he wished to voyage no farther into the dreadful nothingness of the mist-bound ocean. And between his longing and his terror, he quite forgot the terms of that destiny which had been ordained for him by the stars.\n\nThere was no halting nor swerving of the barge; but it drew still nearer to the isle in its coasting; and Nushain saw that the intervening water was clear and shallow, so that a tall man might easily wade to the beach. He sprang into the sea, holding his horoscope aloft, and began to walk toward the island; and Mouzda and Ansarath followed him, swimming side by side.\n\nThough hampered somewhat by his long wet robes, the astrologer thought to reach that alluring shore; nor was there any movement on the part of the merman to intercept him. The water was midway between his waist and his armpits; and now it lapped at his girdle; and now at the knee-folds of his garment; and the island vines and blossoms drooped fragrantly above him.\n\nThen, being but a step from that enchanted beach, he heard a great hissing, and saw that the vines, the boughs, the flowers, the very grasses, were intertwined and mingled with a million serpents, writhing endlessly to and fro in hideous agitation. From all parts of that lofty island the hissing came, and the serpents, with foully mottled volumes, coiled, crept and slithered upon it everywhere; and no single yard of its surface was free from their defilement, or clear for human treading.\n\nTurning seaward in his revulsion, Nushain found the merman and the barge waiting close at hand. Hopelessly he re-entered the barge with his followers, and the magically driven boat resumed its course. And now, for the first time, the merman spoke, saying over his shoulder in a harsh, half-articulate voice, not without irony: \"It would seem, O Nushain, that you lack faith in your own divinations. However, even the poorest of astrologers may sometimes cast a horoscope correctly. Cease, then, to rebel against that which the stars have written.\"\n\nThe barge drove on, and the mists closed heavily about it, and the noon-bright island was lost to view. After a vague interim the muffled sun went down behind inchoate waters and clouds; and a darkness as of primal night lay everywhere. Presently, through the torn rack, Nushain beheld a strange heaven whose signs and planets he could not recognize; and at this there came upon him the black horror of utmost dereliction. Then the mists and clouds returned, veiling that unknown sky from his scrutiny. And he could discern nothing but the merman, who was visible by a wan phosphor that clung always about him in his swimming.\n\nStill the barge drove on; and in time it seemed that a red morning rose stifled and conflagrant behind the mists. The boat entered the broadening light, and Nushain, who had thought to behold the sun once more, was dazzled by a strange shore where flames towered in a high unbroken wall, feeding perpetually, to all appearances, on bare sand and rock. With a mighty leaping and a roar as of blown surf the flames went up, and a heat like that of many furnaces smote far on the sea. Swiftly the barge neared the shore; and the merman, with uncouth gestures of farewell, dived and disappeared under the waters.\n\nNushain could scarcely regard the flames or endure their heat. But the barge touched the strait tongue of land lying between them and the sea; and before Nushain, from the wall of fire, a blazing salamander emerged, having the form and hue of that hieroglyph which had last appeared on his horoscope. And he knew, with ineffable consternation, that this was the third guide of his threefold journey.\n\n\"Come with me,\" said the salamander, in a voice like the crackling of fagots. Nushain stepped from the barge to that strand which was hot as an oven beneath his feet; and behind him, though with palpable reluctance, Mouzda and Ansarath still followed. But, approaching the flames behind the salamander, and half swooning from their ardor, he was overcome by the weakness of mortal flesh; and seeking again to evade his destiny, he fled along the narrow scroll of beach between the fire and the water. But he had gone only a few paces when the salamander, with a great fiery roaring and racing, intercepted him; and it drove him straight toward the fire with terrible flailings of its dragon-like tail, from which showers of sparks were emitted. He could not face the salamander, and he thought the flames would consume him like paper as he entered them: but in the wall there appeared a sort of opening, and the fires arched themselves into an arcade, and he passed through with his followers, herded by the salamander, into an ashen land where all things were veiled with low-hanging smoke and steam.\n\nHere the salamander observed with a kind of irony: \"Not wrongly, O Nushain, have you interpreted the stars of your horoscope. And now your journey draws to an end, and you will need no longer the services of a guide.\" So saying, it left him, going out like a quenched fire on the smoky air.\n\nNushain, standing irresolute, beheld before him a white stairway that mounted amid the veering vapors. Behind him the flames rose unbroken, like a topless rampart; and on either hand, from instant to instant, the smoke shaped itself into demon forms and faces that menaced him. He began to climb the stairs, and the shapes gathered below and about, frightful as a wizard's familiars, and keeping pace with him as he went upward, so that he dared not pause or retreat. Far up he climbed in the fumy dimness, and came unaware to the open portals of a house of grey stone rearing to unguessed height and amplitude.\n\nUnwillingly, but driven by the thronging of the smoky shapes, he passed through the portals with his companions. The house was a place of long, empty halls, tortuous as the folds of a sea-conch. There were no windows, no lamps; but it seemed that bright suns of silver had been dissolved and diffused in the air. Fleeing from the hellish wraiths that pursued him, the astrologer followed the winding halls and emerged ultimately in an inner chamber where space itself was immured. At the room's center a cowled and muffled figure of colossal proportions sat upright on a marble chair, silent, unstirring. Before the figure, on a sort of table, a vast volume lay open.\n\nNushain felt the awe of one who approaches the presence of some high demon or deity. Seeing that the phantoms had vanished, he paused on the room's threshold: for its immensity made him giddy, like the void interval that lies between the worlds. He wished to withdraw; but a voice issued from the cowled being, speaking softly as the voice of his own inmost mind:\n\n\"I am Vergama, whose other name is Destiny; Vergama, on whom you have called so ignorantly and idly, as men are wont to call on their hidden lords; Vergama, who has summoned you on the journey which all men must make at one time or another, in one way or another. Come forward, O Nushain, and read a little in my book.\"\n\nThe astrologer was drawn as by an unseen hand to the table. Leaning above it, he saw that the huge volume stood open at its middle pages, which were covered with a myriad signs written in inks of various colors, and representing men, gods, fishes, birds, monsters, animals, constellations and many other things. At the end of the last column of the right-hand page, where little space was left for other inscriptions, Nushain beheld the hieroglyphs of an equal-sided triangle of stars, such as had lately appeared in proximity to the Dog; and, following these, the hieroglyphs of a mummy, a merman, a barge and a salamander, resembling the figures that had come and gone on his horoscope, and those that had guided him to the house of Vergama.\n\n\"In my book,\" said the cowled figure, \"the characters of all things are written and preserved. All visible forms, in the beginning, were but symbols written by me; and at the last they shall exist only as the writing of my book. For a season they issue forth, taking to themselves that which is known as substance... It was I, O Nushain, who set in the heavens the stars that foretold your journey; I, who sent the three guides. And these things, having served their purpose, are now but infoliate ciphers, as before.\"\n\nVergama paused, and an infinite silence returned to the room, and a measureless wonder was upon the mind of Nushain. Then the cowled being continued:\n\n\"Among men, for a while, there was that person called Nushain the astrologer, together with the dog Aasarath and the negro Mouzda, who followed his fortunes... But now, very shortly, I must turn the page, and before turning it, must finish the writing that belongs thereon.\"\n\nNushain thought that a wind arose in the chamber, moving lightly with a weird sigh, though he felt not the actual breath of its passing. But he saw that the fur of Ansarath, cowering close beside him, was ruffled by the wind. Then, beneath his marvelling eyes, the dog began to dwindle and wither, as if seared by a lethal magic; and he lessened to the size of a rat, and thence to the smallness of a mouse and the lightness of an insect, though preserving still his original form. After that, the tiny thing was caught up by the sighing air, and it flew past Nushain as a gnat might fly; and, following it, he saw that the hieroglyph of a dog was inscribed suddenly beside that of the salamander, at the bottom of the right-hand page. But, apart from this, there remained no trace of Ansarath.\n\nAgain a wind breathed in the room, touching not the astrologer, but fluttering the ragged raiment of Mouzda, who crouched near to his master, as if appealing for protection, and the mute became shrunken and shrivelled, turning at the last to a thing light and thin as the black, tattered wing-shard of a beetle, which the air bore aloft. And Nushain saw that the hieroglyph of a one-eyed Negro was inscribed following that of the dog; but, aside from this, there was no sign of Mouzda.\n\nNow, perceiving clearly the doom that was designed for him, Nushain would have fled from the presence of Vergama. He turned from the outspread volume and ran toward the chamber door, his worn, tawdry robes of an astrologer flapping about his thin shanks. But softly in his ear, as he went, there sounded the voice of Vergama:\n\n\"Vainly do men seek to resist or evade that destiny which turns them to ciphers in the end. In my book, O Nushain, there is room even for a bad astrologer.\"\n\nOnce more the weird sighing arose, and a cold air played upon Nushain as he ran; and he paused midway in the vast room as if a wall had arrested him. Gently the air breathed on his lean, gaunt figure, and it lifted his greying locks and beard, and it plucked softly at the roll of papyrus which he still held in his hand. To his dim eyes, the room seemed to reel and swell, expanding infinitely. Borne upward, around and around, in a swift vertiginous swirling, he beheld the seated shape as it loomed ever higher above him in cosmic vastness. Then the god was lost in light; and Nushain was a weightless and exile thing, the withered skeleton of a lost leaf, rising and falling on the bright whirlwind.\n\nIn the book of Vergama, at the end of the last column of the right-hand page, there stood the hieroglyph of a gaunt astrologer, carrying a furled nativity.\n\nVergama leaned forward from his chair, and turned the page.",

"最终，整个世界都将化为一个虚无的圆环。\n\n——《佐西克古预言集》\n《维尔伽玛之书》篇\n\n在最后的纪元里，人们传说维尔伽玛自佐西克大陆从被历史遗忘的沉没废墟中升起时，便以不朽之姿永恒存在。这片广袤大陆的每个帝国疆域内，始终流传着关于维尔伽玛的传闻——关于他的本质、起源与居所的种种揣测。学者们争论不休：他究竟是恶魔、神明、巫师、幽魂，抑或来自某个与这些存在毫不相干的世界？同样众说纷纭的还有他的栖身之所：是木乃伊盘踞的辛科尔城，北方希拉克险恶的嶙峋群山，落日之海中被迷雾与浪沫笼罩的邪术之岛纳特，还是其他某个失落的海中国度？\n\n从未有人为维尔伽玛塑像立坛，但蛮族会向他祈祷，胆大的巫师则用黑暗如尼文咒语召唤他。有人说这些祈愿得到了回应，但正如关于他的一切，此事同样疑云重重。他被赋予种种诡谲而近乎全能的力量，兼具极致的灾厄与仁慈，却从未有确切证据表明这些特质曾显现于世。在这片被朦胧巫术与多重谜团笼罩的土地上，维尔伽玛始终隐匿于不可知的阴影中。相传千百年来无数人踏入他的秘所，却无一人归来揭示其真容与居所方位。末世的先知们宣称，他与生死同寿，乃未创世之神中的太初与终末。\n\n直至时间尽头，诡异的传说仍如藤蔓缠绕着维尔伽玛。关于踏入他阴影殿堂之人的命运众说纷纭，而那本属于这位神秘存在的《象形文字之书》更衍生出无数奇谈。其中便包括占星师努沙因的遭遇。\n\n努沙因曾踏遍天涯海角观测星轨，尽其所能为万千男女幼童占卜命盘。他辗转城邦与王国，从不久留——地方官吏常斥其为江湖骗子，而求卜者发现预言谬误后也会弃他而去。他时常饥寒交迫，处处遭人轻蔑。陪伴这位落魄占星师的，唯有一只从祖尔-巴-赛尔荒漠小镇跟随他的杂种狗，以及在约罗斯廉价购得的独眼哑奴。他以天狼星为名唤犬只安萨拉斯，称黑奴为穆兹达——意为\"幽暗\"。\n\n漫长的游历后，占星师来到希拉克，栖身于首都乌玛奥斯。这座建于古城废墟上的都城，昔年曾因巫师之怒而毁。努沙因与他的同伴住在朽败公寓的残破阁楼里，每逢晴夜便登上屋顶观测星象。偶有主妇、妓女、脚夫或小贩爬上摇摇欲坠的楼梯，付几枚铜板请他占卜。他总煞有介事地翻检破旧的星象典籍，郑重其事地绘制命盘。\n\n当典籍无法解释某些天象时（这屡见不鲜），他便观察安萨拉斯生疥的尾巴如何摆动，或它捉跳蚤的姿态来占卜。某些预言竟意外应验，使他在乌玛奥斯声名鹊起。求卜者纷至沓来，更因希拉克律法允许一切占卜巫术，他得以免于诉讼。命运的凶星似乎首次向吉星退让。为此他将感恩献给维尔伽玛——整个佐西克大陆公认最强大神秘的精魂，天地万物的主宰者。\n\n某个夏夜，繁星如炽沙遍撒墨蓝天幕时，努沙因携穆兹达登上屋顶。这独眼奴仆视力奇佳，常弥补占星师近视的缺陷。通过特定手势，哑奴能向主人传达观测结果。今夜，主宰努沙因诞生的天狼星座高悬东方。占星师昏花的眼睛察觉星图有异，直到激动的穆兹达指向天狼星臀部附近突然出现的三颗二等新星——它们构成完美的赤红三角，此前从未显现。\n\n\"维尔伽玛在上，这太诡异了。\"占星师惊骇低语。他立即推演这些新星对命盘的影响：根据星辉辐射法则，它们必将改变原本受天狼星主宰的命运轨迹。虽确信这预示重大转折，他却无法断定吉凶。留下穆兹达继续观测后，他匆匆返回阁楼。\n\n整夜他都在古籍中翻检关于新星力量的记载，颤抖着重新推算命盘。直至黎明将死灰色混入烛光，他才得出唯一可能的解读：三角新星与天狼星共现，预示他将启程穿越三重元素之境，穆兹达与安萨拉斯随行，三位向导将相继引领他奔赴命定终点。但此行凶吉未卜，目的地方位亦不可知。\n\n这暧昧预兆令占星师寝食难安。他本已在轻信的乌玛奥斯人中立稳脚跟，不愿离去。更令他不安的是旅程本身——需穿越三重元素、接受三重指引的旅途，显然暗藏某种诡秘天意。\n\n随后数夜，他与穆兹达目睹神秘新星随炽烈天狼星西沉。他不断核查命盘期待找出谬误，却总得出相同结论。随着时间推移，对这场神秘旅程的忧虑日益加深。他如等待黑暗召唤之人，终日恐惧地在访客面容间搜寻，唯恐第一位星象预示的向导悄然现身。\n\n穆兹达与安萨拉斯以哑物的直觉感知主人的不安。黑奴露出恶魔般的扭曲表情，癞皮狗夹着秃尾在桌下瑟缩或焦躁徘徊。这反令努沙因更确信乃凶兆。\n\n某夜，当第五十次检视彩墨绘制的命盘时，他震惊发现空白处多出一个陌生象形文字——用沥青般暗棕色绘制的木乃伊，裹尸布在腿部松散，呈跨步姿态，面朝天狼星所在黄道宫。他确信昨日此处尚无一物，而穆兹达绝无可能触碰命盘。这绝非人间笔墨，宛如来自异界的行星符号正侵入他的命盘。\n\n次日完成日常占卜后，他战战兢兢再次展开命盘，惊觉那褐色象形已跨入较低宫位，仍朝向天狼星逼近。此后每个夜晚，这诡异符号都向天狼星宫挺进一步，直至某夜停驻宫门之前。当黎明灰线穿透夜色时，精疲力竭的努沙因在椅上沉沉睡去，无梦安眠直至黄昏。\n\n他被安萨拉斯凄厉的哀嚎惊醒。尚未睁眼，便嗅到刺鼻的香料与泡碱气味。朦胧视野中，穆兹达点燃的蜡烛映出一个静立身旁的高大木乃伊——沥青色裹尸布紧缠头颈躯干，腰部以下布条松散，露出枯褐双足作行走状。恐惧攫住努沙因的心脏：这分明是侵入命盘的那个象形文字。\n\n从厚重裹尸布中传来模糊低语：\"准备启程吧，努沙因。我乃星辰所示旅途的第一位向导。\"安萨拉斯在床底呜咽，穆兹达试图与它一同藏匿。虽觉死亡临身，占星师仍以毕生维持的尊严起身，唤出躲藏的同伴。\n\n\"我已准备妥当。\"他声音几不可察地颤抖，\"但望能携带些随身物品。\"\n\n木乃伊裹缠的头颅缓缓摇动：\"除命盘外无需他物——最终你所能保留的，唯此而已。\"\n\n努夏因俯身凝视着那张记载着他生辰星象的羊皮纸。就在他准备卷起展开的卷轴时，突然发现那个木乃伊象形文字消失了。仿佛这个书写符号在横穿他的命盘后，竟化作了此刻侍立在他身旁的实体。但在星图底端，与天狼星遥遥相对处，浮现出一个海蓝色的怪异人鱼符号——它长着鲤鱼般的尾巴，头颅半人半猿；而在人鱼身后，还浮现着一艘黑色小船的象形文字。\n\n恐惧在惊异中暂时消退。努夏因小心翼翼地卷起星图，右手紧握着它。\n\n\"来吧，\"引路者说道，\"你的时间所剩无几，必须穿越三重元素的考验，才能抵达维尔伽玛的居所——那里不容凡俗贸然侵扰。\"\n\n这番话在某种程度上印证了占星师的预言。但当他意识到旅程终点将通向那个被称为维尔伽玛的存在那幽暗的殿堂时，未来命运之谜非但没有解开，反而更显阴森。在佐西克所有国度里，关于维尔伽玛的传说纷纭矛盾，唯一共识是这位存在拥有近乎全能的力量。无人知晓其居所方位，但相传千百年来无数人踏入后便永不复返。\n\n努夏因曾如常人般以维尔伽玛之名起誓。可此刻从这个阴森访客口中听到这个名字时，他心中涌起最黑暗的惊惧。他强自镇定，顺从星辰昭示的命运。带着穆兹达与安萨拉斯，他跟随那具迈着大步的木乃伊——那些飘垂的裹尸布似乎丝毫未阻碍它的行动。\n\n留恋地回望散乱的书籍文稿后，他离开阁楼房间走下公寓楼梯。木乃伊的裹尸布泛着惨白微光，除此之外再无照明；整栋房屋诡异地沉浸在黑暗与寂静中，仿佛所有住户都已死去或离去。他听不见城市的夜声，窗外本应可见的小街也被浓稠黑暗吞噬。楼梯似乎也扭曲延伸，不再通向公寓庭院，而是蜿蜒潜入令人窒息的拱顶与散发着硝石恶臭的幽深廊道。\n\n这里弥漫着死亡的气息，努夏因的心沉了下去。在阴影笼罩的墓穴与深邃壁龛中，他感受到无数亡者的存在。行进时，他仿佛听见裹尸布窸窣叹息，僵硬的尸骸在吐息，无唇的牙齿在他身旁咔嗒作响。但黑暗遮蔽了视线，唯有引路者发光的形体在前方穿行，宛如行走在诞生之地。\n\n无边无际的地下墓穴仿佛容纳了万古的腐朽与死亡。身后仍传来穆兹达的脚步声，偶尔夹杂安萨拉斯惊恐的低呜，这让他知道两位仆从依然忠诚。但周遭环境带来的寒意浸透骨髓，活人血肉对引路木乃伊及黑暗中腐朽之物的厌恶令他战栗不已。\n\n为壮胆而开口时，他僵硬的舌头几乎粘住上颚：\"真是维尔伽玛而非他者召唤我踏上这旅程吗？他为何召我？他的居所在何地界？\"\n\n\"是你的命运在召唤，\"木乃伊回答，\"待到命定时刻，你自会知晓缘由。至于第三个问题，即便我告诉你维尔伽玛殿堂所在的隐秘之境也无济于事——那地方既不存在于凡间舆图，也不见于星宿天图。\"\n\n这些模棱两可的回答令努夏因更加不安。随着深入地下墓窟，可怕的预感攫住了他。他想，这段旅程的终点必定无比黑暗，因为初始阶段就已穿越如此辽阔的死亡疆域；而那位召唤者派一具裹着尸衣的干瘪木乃伊作为首任向导，其本质更令人怀疑。\n\n当他几近癫狂地思索时，前方墓窟墙壁在惨淡光线中显现轮廓。跟随木乃伊进入石室后，他看见一座孤立的巨型石棺，周围点着插在锈蚀银烛台上的黑色沥青长烛。走近石棺时，他发现光洁的棺盖与侧壁竟无任何铭文或浮雕；但从尺寸判断，棺内必定躺着一位巨人。\n\n木乃伊毫不停顿地穿过石室。但面对前方漆黑的墓窟，努夏因无法克制地退缩了——尽管星辰命定此行，凡人之躯似乎已无法继续前进。冲动之下，他抓起石棺旁一支沉重的长烛，左手执烛右手紧握星图，带着两位仆从沿原路逃窜，指望借烛光穿越幽暗洞窟返回乌玛奥斯。\n\n身后并未传来木乃伊的追赶声。但奔逃中，疯狂摇曳的沥青蜡烛不断照亮先前被黑暗遮蔽的可怖景象：人类骸骨与狰狞怪兽的遗骸杂乱堆积，破裂的石棺中伸出难以名状生物的半腐肢体——那些既非头颅也非手足的残躯。很快墓道开始分岔，他只能胡乱择路，不知是通向乌玛奥斯还是无人涉足的深渊。\n\n不久他遇见一具无额巨颅，空洞的眼窝仰望着上方；颅骨后方是堵住通道的霉烂骨架，狭窄的岩壁卡住它的肋骨，仿佛这怪物是在进退维谷中死于黑暗。白骨拱廊间结满蛛网，猴头白蛛如潮水般涌出，在占星师面前窸窣坠落时，整具骨架都随之颤动。努夏因与同伴们逃回岔路另择他道。\n\n这次没有鬼蛛追赶。但匆忙奔逃间，一道横贯墓道的巨坑拦住了去路。安萨拉斯嗅到坑中气味后发狂般嗥叫后退。努夏因持烛照见坑底泛着油光的黑水上漾开圈圈涟漪，中央浮动着两点血红色光斑。突然响起巫师炼火煮沸大釜般的嘶嘶声，黑水翻涌着邪恶地漫上坑沿；当那对红芒逼近时，他看清那是正恶毒凝视着自己的发光眼睛......\n\n努夏因仓皇转身，在墓道交汇处发现等候他的木乃伊。\n\n\"看来你对自己的星象产生了怀疑啊，努夏因，\"引路者语带讥讽，\"不过即便最蹩脚的占星师偶尔也能解读天意。服从星辰为你安排的旅程吧。\"\n\n此后努夏因不再抗拒。回到巨型石棺所在的石室后，他按指引将偷走的黑烛插回烛台。仅凭木乃伊裹尸布的磷光，他们穿行于更深处污秽的骨穴。最终，当朦胧天光渗入洞穴阴影时，他们来到笼罩在雾霭下的狂野海岸，海浪在云沫中咆哮。木乃伊仿佛畏惧刺目的天光般退回地底，说道：\n\n\"我的领界至此为止，你必须在此等候第二位引路者。\"\n\n海风裹挟着咸涩气息，努夏因的衣发在狂风中翻飞。随着锈蚀青铜门在洞口关闭的声音，他发现自己被困在峭壁环抱的海滩上。不久，碎浪中浮现一个蓝鳞人鱼——它半人半鱼的头颅与星图边缘出现过的人鱼符号一模一样；人鱼身后漂来一艘无人操控的黑色小舟。展开星图时，努夏因惊愕地发现那两个符号已然消失，如同先前的木乃伊符号般穿越黄道十二宫，直抵主宰他命运的那一宫——或许正是由此它们才化为实体。而此刻星图边缘与天狼星相对的，是一个火红色蝾螈的燃烧符号。\n\n人鱼咧开鲨鱼般的利齿，用古怪手势示意他登船。努夏因顺从地踏入小舟，忠仆紧随其后。人鱼游向沸腾的浪涛，仿佛被魔法驱使的小舟立即调转船头，逆着风浪平稳驶向那幽暗无名的海洋。\n\n在飞沫与雾霭中，人鱼始终在前引航。这段航程似乎超越了时空界限，努夏因既不饥也不渴，灵魂却漂浮在陌生疑虑与极端疏离的海洋上。他试图询问目的地，却得不到回应。来自未知岸边的风与流向神秘海湾的潮汐，都充满令人战栗的私语。\n\n当迷雾突然裂开时，高悬的太阳倾泻下金色瀑布。近处浮现一座苍翠岛屿，贝壳状穹顶与繁花花园高悬于炫目午阳中。宁静海浪轻抚着从未受过风暴侵袭的茵茵岸滩，果藤垂花悬于水面上。整座岛屿散发着令人遗忘的安眠咒语，仿佛登岸者将永远沉浸在阳光灿烂的梦境里。努夏因渴望踏上这片绿意盎然的避难所，不愿继续航向雾锁海洋的可怖虚无。在渴望与恐惧间，他全然忘记了星辰为他安排的命运。\n\n小舟并未停泊或转向，但在靠近岛屿时，努夏因发现其间海水清浅可涉。他高举星图跃入海中，向岛屿走去，两位忠仆并肩游随其后。\n\n尽管浸湿的长袍妨碍行动，占星师仍坚信能抵达那片诱人岸滩——人鱼也并未阻拦。当海水从腰间退至膝际，岛屿的垂花藤蔓已近在咫尺时，他突然听见震天嘶响，发现每根藤蔓、枝条、花朵乃至草叶间都缠绕着无数斑纹毒蛇。整座高耸的岛屿回荡着蛇群的嘶鸣，每一寸土地都爬满令人作呕的蠕动。\n\n努夏因厌恶地转身，发现人鱼与小舟正在不远处等候。绝望中他带着仆从重返小舟，魔法驱动的小舟继续航程。此刻人鱼首次开口，扭头用沙哑含混的嗓音讥讽道：\"看来你对自己的预言缺乏信心啊，努夏因。不过即便最拙劣的占星师偶尔也能算准命盘。别再抗拒星辰的旨意了。\"\n\n小舟前行，浓雾重新合拢，正午明亮的岛屿消失无踪。在模糊的间隙后，混沌云水间西沉的太阳带走了最后的光明，原始之夜笼罩四野。当破碎的云层间露出陌生天象时，被遗弃的终极恐怖攫住了努夏因。随后迷雾再度遮蔽了不可知的苍穹，唯有人鱼周身萦绕的惨淡磷光，仍在游泳时依稀可见。\n\n那艘驳船依旧向前疾驰；渐渐地，浓雾后方升起一轮暗红如闷烧炭火般的朝阳。当小舟驶入逐渐开阔的光域时，努夏因——这个本以为能重见天日的人——却被奇异的海岸炫得睁不开眼：火焰在那里筑起连绵不绝的高墙，赤裸的沙石竟成了永恒燃烧的燃料。火舌如惊涛般咆哮跃动，熔炉般的热浪灼烧着远方海面。驳船迅速靠岸，人鱼以古怪的告别姿态潜入水中消失不见。\n\n努夏因几乎无法直视烈焰，更难以忍受其炙烤。但当驳船触及火焰与大海之间的狭长陆地时，一只燃烧的蝾螈从火墙中现身——其形态色泽正与星盘上最后显现的象形符号如出一辙。他怀着难以名状的惊惶意识到，这正是三重旅途中的第三位引路者。\n\n\"随我来。\"蝾螈说道，声音犹如柴薪爆裂。努夏因踏上滚烫如烤炉的沙地，穆兹达与安萨拉斯虽不情愿却仍紧随其后。可当他跟随蝾螈逼近火墙，几乎被热浪灼晕时，凡人血肉的脆弱终占了上风。为逃避宿命，他沿着水火夹峙的狭长海岸奔逃。未出几步，蝾螈便挟着烈焰轰鸣截住去路，龙尾扫出漫天火星，将他逼向火墙。就在他以为身躯将如薄纸般焚毁时，火焰竟拱成拱廊，迫使众人穿过烟幕踏入灰烬之地。\n\n蝾螈讥诮道：\"星象解读无误啊，努夏因。旅途将尽，你不再需要引路者了。\"说罢便如熄灭的余烬般消散于烟雾中。\n\n犹豫不决的努夏因看见白垩阶梯盘旋于翻腾的雾气中。下方烟雾凝聚成恶魔形态步步紧逼，迫使他攀登至一座拔地参天的灰石宅邸。穿过贝壳纹路般迂回的长廊，他在无窗无灯的厅堂深处遇见端坐大理石椅的蒙面巨人——命运之神维尔加玛。\n\n\"我即维尔加玛，亦名宿命。\"罩袍下的声音如同心灵回响，\"来读读我的书吧。\"摊开的巨册中央显现出与星盘完全一致的符号：三星连珠、木乃伊、人鱼、驳船与蝾螈。\n\n\"万物皆是我书写的符号。\"神祇低语，\"包括预言你旅程的星辰与三位引路者。\"\n\n突然阴风骤起。努夏因惊恐地看着安萨拉斯缩成老鼠大小，最终化为书页角落的犬形符号；穆兹达则化作甲虫残翅般的黑影，成为紧随其后的独眼黑人象形文。当他转身逃窜时，维尔加玛的声音在耳畔响起：\n\n\"凡人终将沦为书页符号，拙劣的占星师也不例外。\"\n\n刺骨寒风卷起努夏因灰白的须发，他如枯叶般在炫目旋风里飘荡。当维尔加玛翻动书页时，右栏末尾已多出个手持卷轴的枯瘦占星师象形文。"

        "content": "\n\nDead longing, sundered evermore from pain: How dim and sweet the shadow-hearted love, The happiness that perished lovers prove In Naat, far beyond the sable main.\n\nSong of the Galley-Slaves.\n\nYadar, prince of a nomad people in the half-desert region known as Zyra, had followed throughout many kingdoms a clue that was often more elusive than broken gossamer. For thirteen moons he had sought Dalili, his betrothed, whom the slave traders of Sha-Rag, swift and cunning as desert falcons, had reft from the tribal encampment with nine other maidens while Yadar and his men were hunting the black gazelles of Zyra. Fierce was the grief of Yadar, and fiercer still his wrath, when he came back at eve to the ravaged tents. He had sworn then a great oath to find Dalili, whether in a slave-mart or brothel or harem, whether dead or living, whether tomorrow or after the lapse of gray years.\n\nDisguised as a rug merchant, with four of his men in like attire, and guided only by the gossip of bazaars, he had gone from capital to capital of the continent Zothique. One by one his followers had died of strange fevers or the hardships of the route. After much random wandering and pursuit of vain rumors, he had come alone to Oroth, a western seaport of the land of Xylac.\n\nThere he heard a rumor that might concern Dalili; for the people of Oroth were still gossiping about the departure of a rich galley bearing a lovely outland girl, answering to her description, who had been bought by the emperor of Xylac and sent to the ruler of the far southern kingdom of Yoros as a gift concluding a treaty between these realms.\n\nYadar, now hopeful of finding his beloved, took passage on a ship that was about to sail for Yoros. The ship was a small merchant galley, laden with grain and wine, that was wont to coast up and down, hugging closely the winding western shores of Zothique and venturing never beyond eyesight of land. On a clear blue summer day it departed from Oroth with all auguries for a safe and tranquil voyage. But on the third morn after leaving port, a tremendous wind blew suddenly from the low-lying shore they were then skirting; and with it, blotting the heavens and sea, there came a blackness as of night thickened with clouds; and the vessel was swept far out, going blindly with the blind tempest.\n\nAfter two days the wind fell from its ravening fury and was soon no more than a vague whisper; and the skies cleared, leaving a bright azure vault from horizon to horizon. But nowhere was there any land visible, only a waste of waters that still roared and tossed turbulently without wind, pouring ever westward in a tide too swift and strong for the galley to stem. And the galley was borne on irresistibly by that strange current, even as by the hurricane.\n\nYadar, who was the sole passenger, marveled much at this thing; and he was struck by the pale terror on the faces of the captain and crew. And, looking again at the sea, he remarked a singular darkening of its waters, which assumed from moment to moment a hue as of old blood commingled with more and more of blackness: though above it the sun shone untarnished. So he made inquiry of the captain, a graybeard from Yoros, named Agor, who had sailed the ocean for forty summers; and the captain answered:\n\n'This I had apprehended when the storm bore us westward: for we have fallen into the grip of that terrible ocean-stream which mariners call the Black River. Evermore the stream surges and swiftens toward the place of the sun's outermost setting, till it pours at last from the world's rim. Between us now and that final verge there is no land saving the evil land of Naat, which is called also the Isle of Necromancers. I know not which were the worse fate, to be wrecked on that infamous isle or hurled into space with the waters falling from earth's edge. From either place there is no return for living men such as we. And from the Isle of Naat none go forth except the ill sorcerers who people it, and the dead who are raised up and controlled by their sorcery. In magical ships that breast the Black River, the sorcerers sail at will to other strands; and beneath their necromancy. to fulfill their wicked errands, the dead men swim without pause for many nights and days whither-so-ever the masters may send them.'\n\nYadar, who knew little of sorcerers and neocromancy, was somewhat incredulous concerning these matters. But he saw that the blackening waters streamed always more wildly and torrentially towards the skyline; and verily there was small hope that the galley could regain its southward course. And he was troubled chiefly by the thought that he should never reach the kingdom of Yoros, where he had dreamt to find Dalili.\n\nAll that day the vessel was borne on by the dark seas racing weirdly beneath an airless and immaculate heaven. It followed the orange sunset into a night filled with large, unquivering stars; and at length it was overtaken by the flying amber morn. But still there was no abating of the waters; and neither land nor cloud was discernible in the vastness about the galley.\n\nYadar held little converse with Agor and the crew, after questioning them as to the reason of the ocean's blackness, which was a thing that no man understood. Despair was upon him; but, standing at the bulwark, he watched the sky and wave with an alertness born of his nomad life. Toward afternoon he descried far off a strange vessel with funereal purple sails, that drove steadily on an eastering course against the mighty current. He called Agor's attention to the vessel; and Agor, with a muttering of sailors' oaths, told him that it was a ship belonging to the necromancers of Naat.\n\nSoon the purple sails were lost to vision; but a little later, Yadar perceived certain objects resembling human heads, that passed in the high-billowing water to the galley's leeward. Deeming that no mortal living men could swim thus, and remembering that which Agor had said concerning the dead swimmers who went forth from Naat, Yadar was aware of such trepidation as a brave man may feel in the presence of things beyond nature. And he did not speak of the matter; and seemingly the head-like objects were not noticed by his companions.\n\nStill the galley drove on, its oarsmen sitting idle at the oars, and the captain standing listless beside the untended helm.\n\nToward night, as the sun declined above that tumultuous ebon ocean, it seemed that a great bank of thunder-cloud arose from the west, long and low-lying at first, but surging rapidly skyward with the mountainous domes. Ever higher it loomed, revealing the menace as of piled cliffs and somber, awful sea-capes; but its form changed not in the fashion of clouds; and Yadar knew it at last for an island bulking far aloft in the long-rayed sunset. From it a shadow was thrown for leagues, darkening still more the sable waters, as if with the fall of untimely night; and in the shadow the foam-crests flashing upon hidden reefs were white as the bared teeth of death. And Yadar needed not the shrill frightened cries of his companions to tell him that this was the terrible Isle of Naat.\n\nDirely the current swiftened, raging, as it raced onward for battle with the rock-fanged shore; and the voices of the mariners, praying loudly to their gods, were drowned by its clamor. Yadar, standing in the prow, gave only a silent prayer to the dim, fatal deity of his tribe; and his eyes searched the towering isle like those of a sea-flown hawk, seeing the bare horrific crags, and the spaces of dark forest creeping seaward between the crags, and the white mounting of monstrous breakers an a shadowy strand.\n\nShrouded, and ominous of bale was the island's aspect. and the heart of Yadar sank like a plummet in unsunned seas. As the galley hove nearer to land, he thought that he beheld people moving darkly, visible in the lapsing of surges on a low beach, and then hidded once more by foam and spindrift. Ere he saw them a second time, the galley was hurled with thunderous crashing and grinding on a reef buried beneath the torrent waters. The fore-part of its prow and bottom were broken in, and being lifted from the reef by a second comber, it filled instantly and sank. Of those who had sailed from Oroth, Yadar alone leapt free ere its foundering; but, since he was little skilled as a swimmer, he was drawn under quickly and was like to have drowned in the maelstroms of that evil sea.\n\nHis senses left him, and in his brain, like a lost sun returned from yesteryear, he beheld the face of Dalili; and with Dalili, in a bright fantasmagoria, there came the happy days that had been ere his bereavement. The visions passed, and he awoke struggling, with the bitterness of the sea in his mouth, and its loudness in his ears, and its rushing darkness all about him. And, as his seases quickened, he became aware of a form that swam close behind him, and arms that supported him amid the water.\n\nHe lifted his head and saw dimly the pale neck and halfaverted face of his rescuer, and the long black hair that floated from wave to wave. Touching the body at his side, he knew it for that of a woman. Mazed and wildered though he was by the sea's buffeting, a sense of something familiar stirred within him, and he thought that he had known somewhere, at some former time. a woman with like hair and similar curving of cheek. And, trying to remember, he touched the woman again, and felt in his fingers a strange coldness from her naked body.\n\nMiraculous was the woman's strength and skill, for she rode easily the dreadful mounting and falling of the surges. Yadar, floating as in a cradle upon her arm, beheld the nearing shore from the billows' summits; and hardly it seemed that any swimmer, however able, could win alive through the wildness of that surf. Dizzily; at the last, they were hurled upward, as if the surf would fling them against the highest crag; but, as if checked by some enchantment, the wave fell with a slow, lazy undulation; and Yadar and his rescuer, released by its ebbing, lay unhurt on a shelfy beach.\n\nUttering no word, nor turning to look at Yadar, the woman rose to her feet; and, beckoning him to follow, she moved away in the deathly blue dusk that had fallen upon Naat. Yadar, arising and following the woman, heard a strange and eery chanting of voices above the sea's tumult, and saw a fire that burned weirdly, with the colors of driftwood, at some distance before him in the dusk. Straightly, toward the fire and the voices, the woman walked. And Yadar, with eyes grown used to that doubtful twilight, saw that the fire blazed in the mouth of a low-sunken cleft between crags that overloomed the beach; and behind the fire, like tall, evilly posturing shadows, there stood the dark-clad figures of those who chanted.\n\nNow memory returned to him of that which the galley's captain had said regarding the necromancers of Naat and their practises. The very sound of that chanting, albeit in an unknown tongue, seemed to suspend the heartward flowing of his veins, and to set the tomb's chillness in his marrow. And though he was little learned in such matters, the thought came to him that the words uttered were of sorcerous import and power.\n\nGoing forward, the woman bowed low before the chanters, like a slave. The men, who were three in number, continued their incantation without pausing. Gaunt as starved herons they were, and great of stature, with a common likeness; and their sunk eyes were visible only by red sparks reflected within them from the blaze. And their eyes, as they chanted, seemed to glare afar on the darkling sea and on things hidden by dusk and distance. And Yadar, coming before them, was aware of swift horror and repugnance that made his gorge rise as if he had encountered, in a place given to death, the powerful evil ripeness of corruption.\n\nHigh leaped the fire, with a writhing of tongues like blue and green serpents coiling amid serpents of yellow. And the light flickered brightly on the face and breasts of that woman who had saved Yadar from the Black River; and he, beholding her closely, knew why she had stirred within him a dim remembrance: for she was none other than his lost love, Dalili!\n\nForgetting the presence of the dark chanters, he sprang forward to clasp his beloved, crying out her name in an agony of rapture. But she answered him not, and responded to his embrace only with a faint trembling. And Yadar, sorely perplexed and dismayed, was aware of the deathly coldness that crept into his fingers and smote through his very raiment from her flesh. Mortally pale and languid were the lips that he kissed, and it seemed that no breath emerged between them, nor was there any rising and falling of the wan bosom against his. In the wide, beautiful eyes that she turned to him, he found only a drowsy voidness, and such recognition as a sleeper gives when but half awakened, relapsing quickly into slumber thereafter.\n\n'Art thou indeed Dalili?' he said. And she answered somnolently, in a toneless, indistinct voice: 'I am Dalili.'\n\nTo Yadar, baffled by mystery, forlorn and aching, it was as if she had spoken from a land farther away than all the weary leagues of his search for her. Fearing to understand the change that had come upon her, he said tenderly:\n\n'Surely thou knowest me, for I am thy lover, the Prince Yadar, who has sought thee through half the kingdoms of earth, and has sailed afar for thy sake on the unshored sea.\n\nAnd she replied like one bemused by some heavy drug, as if echoing his words without true comprehension: 'Surely I know thee.' And to Yadar there was no comfort in her reply; and his concernment was not allayed by the parrotings with which she answered all his other loving speeches and queries.\n\nHe knew not that the three chanters had ceased their incantation; and, verily, he had forgotten their presence. But as he stood holding the girl closely, the men came toward him, and one of them clutched his arm. And the man hailed him by name and addressed him, though somewhat uncouthly, in a language spoken throughout many parts of Zothique, saying: 'We bid thee welcome to the Isle of Naat.'\n\nYadar, feeling a dread suspicion, imterrogated the man fiercely: 'What manner of beings are ye? And why is Dalili here? And what have ye done to her?'\n\n'I am Vacharn, a necromancer,' the man replied, 'and these others with me are my sons, Vokal and Uldulla, who are also necromancers. We dwell in a house behind the crags, and are attended by the drowned people that our sorcery has called up from the sea. Among our servants is this girl, Dalili, together with the crew of that ship in which she sailed from Oroth. Like the vessel in which thou camest later, the ship was blown far asea and was taken by the Black River and wrecked finally on the reefs of Naat. My sons and I, chanting that powerful formula which requires no use of circle or pentacle, summoned ashore the drowned company: even as we have now summoned the crew of that other vessel, from which thou alone wert saved alive by the dead swimmer, at our command.'\n\nVacharn ended, and stood peering into the dusk intently; and Yadar heard behind him a noise of slow footsteps coming upward across the shingle from the surf. Turning, he saw emerge from the livid twilight the old captain of that galley in which he had voyaged to Naat; and behind the captain were the sailors and oarsmen. With the paces of sleep-walkers they approached the firelight, the sea-water dripping heavily from their raiment and hair, and drooling from their mouths. Some were sorely bruised, and others came stumbling or dragging with limbs broken by the rocks on which the sea had flung them; and on their faces was the look of men who had suffered the doom of drowning.\n\nStiffly, like automatons, they made obeisance to Vacharn and his sons, acknowledging thus their thralldom to those who had called them from deep death. In their glassily staring eyes there was no recognition of Yadar, no awareness of outward things; and they spoke only in dull, rote-like recognition of certain obscure words addressed to them by the necromancers.\n\nTo Yadar, it was as if he too stood and moved like the living dead in a dark, hollow, half-conscious dream. Walkby the enchanters through a dim ravine that wound secretly toward the uplands of Naat. In his heart there was small joy at the finding of Dalili; and his love was companioned with a sick despair.\n\nVacharn lit the way with a brand of driftwood plucked from the fire. Anon a bloated moon rose red as with saniesmingled blood, over the wild, racing sea; and before its orb had cleared to a deathlike paleness, they emerged from the gorge on a stony fell where stood the house of the three necromancers.\n\nThe house was built of dark granite, with long low wings that crouched amid the foliage of close-grown cypresses. Behind it a cliff beetled; and above the cliff were somber slopes and ridges piled in the moonlight rising afar toward the mountainous center of Naat.\n\nIt seemed that the mansion was a place pre-empted by death: for no lights burned in its portals and windows; and a silence came from it to meet the stillness of the wan heavens. But, when the sorcerers neared the threshold, a word was spoken by Vachara, echoing distantly in the inner halls; and as if in answer, lamps glowed suddenly everywhere, filling the house with their monstrous yellow eyes; and people appeared instantly within the portals like bowing shadows. But the faces of these beings were blanched by the tomb's pallor, and some were mottled with green decay, or marked by the tortuous gnawing of maggots...\n\nIn a great hall of the house, Yadar was bidden to seat himself at a table where Vacharn and Vokal and Uldulla commonly sat alone during their meals. The table stood on a dais of gigantic flagstones; and below, in the main hall, the dead were gathered about other tables, numbering nearly two score; and among them sat the girl Dalili, look never toward Yadar. He would have joined her, unwilling to be parted from her side: but a deep languor was upon him, as if an unspoken spell had enthralled his limbs and he could no longer move of his own volition.\n\nDully he sat with his grim, taciturn hosts who, dwelling always with the silent dead, had assumed no little part of their manner. And he saw more clearly than before the common likeness of the three: for all, it seemed, were as brothers of one birth rather than parent and sons; and all were like ageless things, being neither old nor young in the fashion of ordinary men. And more and more was he aware of that weird evil which emanated from the three, powerful and abhorrent as an exhalation of hidden death.\n\nIn the thralldom that weighed upon him, he scarcely marveled at the serving of that strange supper: though meats were brought in by no palpable agency, and wines poured out as if by the air itself; and the passing of the bearers to and fro was betrayed only by a rustle of doubtful footsteps, and a light chillness that came and went.\n\nMutely, with stiff gestures and movements, the dead began to eat at their tables. But the necromancers refrained from the victuals before them, in an attitude of waiting; and Vacharn said to the nomad: 'There are others who will sup with us tonight.' And Yadar then perceived that a vacant chair had been set beside the chair of Vacharn.\n\nAnon, from an inner doorway, there entered with hasty strides a man of great thews and stature, naked, and brown almost to blackness. Savage of aspect was the man, and his eyes were dilated as with rage or terror, and his thick purple lips were flecked with foam. And behind him, lifting in menace their heavy, rusted scimitars, there came two of the dead seamen, like guards who attend a prisoner.\n\n'This man is a cannibal,' said Vacharn. 'Our servants have captured him in the forest beyond the mountains, which is peopled by such savages.' He added: 'Only the strong and courageous are summoned living to this mansion... Not idly, O Prince Yadar, wert thou chosen for such honor. Observe closely all that follows.'\n\nThe savage had paused within the threshold, as if fearing the hall's occupants more than the weapons of his guards. One of the liches slashed his left shoulder with the rusty blade, and blood rilled from a deep wound as the cannibal came forward beneath that prompting. Convulsively he trembled, like a frightened animal, looking wildly to either side for an avenue of escape; and only after a second prompting did he mount the dais and approach the necromancers' table. But, after certain hollow-sounding words had been uttered by Vacharn, the man seated himself, still trembling, in the chair beside the master, opposite to Yadar. And behind him, with high-raised weapons, there stationed themselves the ghastly guards, whose features were those of men a fortnight dead.\n\n'There is still another guest,' said Vacharn. 'He will come later; and we need not wait for him.'\n\nWithout further ceremony he began to eat, and Yadar. though with little appetence, followed suit. Hardly did the prince perceive the savor of those viands with which his plate was piled; nor could he have sworn whether the vintages he drunk were sour or dulcet. His thoughts were divided between Dalili and the strangeness and horror about him.\n\nAs he ate and drank, his senses were sharpened weirdly, and he grew aware of eldritch shadows moving between the lamps, and heard the chill sibilance of whispers that checked his very blood. And there came to him, from the peopled hall, every odor that is exhaled by mortality between the recentness of death and the end of corruption. Vacharn and his sons addressed themselves to the meal with the unconcern of those long used to such surroundings. But the canibal, whose fear was still palpable, refused to touch the food before him. Blood, in two heavy rills, ran unceasingly down his bosom from his wounded shoulders, and dripped audibly on the stone flags.\n\nFinally, at the urging of Vacharn, who spoke in the cannibal's own tongue, he was persuaded to drink from a cup of wine. This wine was not the same that had been served to the rest of the company, being of a violet color, dark as the nightshade's blossom, while the other wine was a poppy red. Hardly had the man tasted it when he sank back in his chair with the appearance of one smitten helpless by palsy. The cup, rilling the remnant of its contents, was still clutched in his rigid fingers; there was no movement, no trembling of his limbs; and his eyes were wide open and staring as if consciousness still remained within him.\n\nA dire suspicion sprang up in Yadar, and no longer could he eat the food and drink the wine of the necromancers. And he was puzzled by the actions of his hosts who, abstaining likewise, turned in the chairs and peered steadily at a portion of the door behind Vacharn, between the table and the hall's inner end. Yadar, rising a little in his seat, looked down across the table, and perceived a small hole in one of the flagstones. The hole was such as might be inhabited by a small animal: but Yadar could not surmise the nature of a beast that burrowed in solid granite.\n\nIn a loud clear voice, Vacharn spoke the single word, 'Esrit,' as if calling the name of one that he wished to summon. Not long thereafter, two little sparks of fire appeared in the darkness of the hole, and from it sprang a creature having somewhat the size and form of a weasel, but even longer and thinner. The creature's fur was a rusted black, and its paws were like tiny hairless hands; and its beaded eyes of flaming yellow seemed to hold the malign wisdom and malevolence of a demon. Swiftly, with writhing movements that gave it the air of a furred serpent, it ran forward beneath the chair occupied by the cannibal, and began to drink greedily the pool of blood that had dripped down on the floor from his wounds.\n\nThen, while horror fastened upon the heart of Yadar. it leapt to the cannibal's knees, and thence to his left shoulder, where the deepest wound had been inflicted. There the thing applied itself to the still bleeding cut from which it sucked in the fashion of a weasel; the blood ceased to flow down on the man's body. And the man stirred not in his chair; but his eyes still widened, slowly, with a horrible glaring, till the ball were isled in livid white; and his lips fell slackly apart, showing teeth that were strong and pointed, as those of a shark.\n\nThe necromancers had resumed their eating, with eyes attentive on the small bloodthirsty monster; and it came to Yadar that this was the other guest expected by Vacharn. Whether the thing was an actual weasel, or a sorcerer's familiar, he did not know; but anger followed upon his horror before the plight of the cannibal; and drawing a sword he had carried through all his travels, he sprang to his feet and would have tried to kill the monster. But Vacharn described in the air a peculiar sign with his forefinger; and the prince's arm was suspended in mid-stroke, and his fingers became weak as those of a babe, and the sword fell from his hand, ringing loudly on the dais. Thereafter, as if by the unspoken will of Vacharn, he was constrained to seat himself again at the table.\n\nInsatiable, it seemed, was the thirst of the weasel-like creature: for, after many minutes had gone by, it continued to suck the blood of the savage. From moment to moment the man's mighty thews became strangely shrunken, and the bones and taut sinews showed starkly beneath wrinkling folds of skin. His face was like the chapless face of death, his limbs were lean as those of an old mummy: but the thing that battened upon him had increased in size only so much as a stoat increases by sucking the blood of some farmyard fowl.\n\nBy this token, Yadar knew that the thing was indeed a demon and was no doubt, the familiar of Vacharn. Entranced with terror, he sat regarding it, till the creature dropped from the dry bones and skin of the cannibal, and ran with an evil writhing and slithering to its hole in the flagstone.\n\nWeird was the life that now began for Yadar in the house of the necromancers. Upon him there rested always the malign thralldom that had over-powered him during that first supper; and he moved one who could not wholly awake from some benumbing dream. It seemed that his volition was in some way controlled by those masters of the living dead. But, more than this, he was held by the old enchantment of his love for Dalili: though the love had now turned to a spell of despair.\n\nSomething he learned of the necromancers and their mode of existence: though Vacharn spoke seldom except with grim ironies; and the sons of Vacharn were taciturn as the dead. He learned that the weasel-like familiar, whose name was Esrit, had undertaken to serve Vacharn for a given term, receiving in guerdon, at the full of each moon, the blood of a living man chosen for redoubtable strength and valor. And it was clear to Yadar that, in default of some miracle, or sorcery beyond that of the necromancers, his days of life were limited by the moon's period. For, other than himself and the masters, there was no person in all that mansion who had not already passed through the bitter gates of death...\n\nLonely was the house, standing far apart from all neighbors. Other necromancers dwelt on the shores of Naat; but betwixt these and the hosts of Yadar there was little intercourse. And beyond the wild mountains that divided the isle, there dwelt only certain tribes of anthropophagi, who warred with each other in the black woods of pine and cypress.\n\nThe dead were housed in deep catacomb-like caves behind the mansion, lying all night in stone coffins, and coming forth in daily resurrection to do the tasks ordained by the masters. Some tilled the rocky gardens on a slope sheltered from sea-wind; others tended the sable goats and cattle; and still others were sent out as divers for pearls in the sea that ravened prodigiously, not to be dared by living swimmers, on the bleak atolls and headlands horned with granite. Of such pearls, Vacharn had amassed a mighty store through years exceeding the common span of life. And sometimes, in a ship that sailed contrary to the Black River, he or one of his sons would voyage to Zothique with certain of the dead for crew, and would trade the pearls for such things as their magic was unable to raise up in Naat.\n\nStrange it was to Yadar, to see the companions of his voyage passing to and fro with the other liches, greeting him only in mindless echo of his own salutations, And bitter it was, yet never without a dim sorrowful sweetness, to behold Dalili and speak with her, trying vainly to revive the lost ardent love in a heart that had gone fathom-deep into oblivion and had not returned therefrom. And always, with a desolate yearning, he seemed to grope toward her across a gulf more terrible than the stemless tide that poured for ever about the Isle of the Necromancers.\n\nDalili, who had swum from childhood in the sunken lakes of Zyra, was among those enforced to dive for pearls. Often Yadar would accompany her to the shore and await her return from the mad surges; and at whiles he was tempted to fling himself after her and find, if such were possible, the peace of very death. This he would surely have doae: but amid the eery wilderments of his plight, and the gray webs of sorcery woven about it, it seemed that his old strength and resolution were wholly lacking.\n\nOne day, toward sunset-time, as the month drew to its end, Vokal and Uldulla approached the prince where he stood waiting on a rock-walled beach while Dalili dived far out in the torrent waters. Speaking no word, they beckoned to him with furtive signs; and Yadar, vaguely curious as to their intent, suffered them to lead him from the beach and by perilous paths that wound from crag to crag above the curving sea-shore. Ere the fall of darkness, they came to a small landlocked harbor whose existence had been heretofore unsuspected by the nomad. In that placid bay, beneath the deep umbrage of the isle, there rode a galley with somber purple sails, resembling the ship that Yadar had discerned moving steadily toward Zothique against the full tide of the Black River.\n\nYadar was much bewondered, nor could he divine why they had brought him to the hidden harbor, nor the import of their gestures as they pointed out the strange vessel. Then, in a hushed and covert whisper, as if fearing to be overheard in that remote place, Vokal said to him:\n\n'If thou wilt aid my brother and me in the execution of a certain plan, thou shalt have the use of yonder galley in quitting Naat. And with thee, if such be thy desire, thou shalt take the girl Dalili, together with certain of the dead mariners for oarsmen. Favored by the powerful gales which our enchantments will evoke for thee, thou shalt sail against the Black River and return to Zothique... But if thou helpest us not, then shall the weasel Esrit suck thy blood, till the last member of thy body has been emptied thereof; and Dalili shall remain as the bond-slave of Vacharn, toiling for his avarice by day in the dark waters ... and perchance serving his lust by night.'\n\nAt the promise of Vokal, Yadar felt something of hope and manhood revive within him, and it seemed that thebaleful sorcery of Vacharn was lifted from his mind; and an indignation against Vacharn was awakened by Vokal's hintings. And he said quickly: 'I will aid thee in thy plan, whatever it may be, if such aid is within my power to give.'\n\nThen, with many fearful glances about and behind him, Uldulla took up the furtive whispering.\n\n'It is our thought that Vacharn has lived beyond the allotted term, and has imposed his authority upon us too long. We, his sons, grow old: and we deem it no more than rightful that we should inherit the stored treasures and the magical supremacy of our father ere age has debarred us from their enjoyment. Therefore we seek thy help in the slaying of Vacharn.'\n\nIt came to Yadar, after brief reflection, that the killing of the necromancer should be held in all ways a righteous deed, and one to which he could lend himself without demeaning his valor or his manhood. So he said without demur: 'I will help thee in this thing.'\n\nSeeming greatly emboldened by Yadar's consent, Vokal spoke again in his turn, saying: 'This thing must be accomplished ere tomorrow's eve, which will bring a full-rounded moon from the Black River upon Naat, and will call the weasel-demon Esrit from his burrow. And tomorrow's forenoon is the only time when we can take Vacharn unaware in his chamber. During those hours, as is his wont, he will peer entranced on a magic mirror that yields visions of the outer sea, and the ships sailing over the sea, and the lands lying beyond. And we must slay him before the mirror, striking swiftly and surely ere he awakens from his trance.\n\nAt the hour set for the deed. Vokal and Uldulla came to Yadar where he stood awaiting them in the outer hall. Each of the brothers bore in his right hand a long and coldly glittering scimitar; and Vokal also carried in his left a like weapon, which he offered to the prince, explaining that these scimitars had been tempered to a muttering of lethal runes, and inscribed afterward with unspeakable deathspells. Yadar, preferring his own sword, declined the wizard weapon; and, delaying no more, the three went hastily and with all possible stealth toward Vacharn's chamber.\n\nThe house was empty, for the dead had all gone forth to their labors; nor was there any whisper or shadow of those invisible beings, whether sprites of the air or mere phantoms, that waited upon Vacharn and served him in sundry ways. Silently the three came to the portals of the chamber, where entrance was barred only by a black arras wrought with the signs of night in silver, and bordered with a repetition of the fives names of the archfiend Thasaidon in scarlet thread. The brothers paused, as if fearing to lift the arras; but Yadar, unhesitating, held it aside and passed into the chamber; and the twain followed him quickly as if for shame of their poltroonery.\n\nThe room was large, high-vaulted, and lit by a dim window looking forth between unpruned cypresses toward the black sea, No flames arose from the myriad lamps to assist that baffled daylight; and shadows brimmed the place like a spectral fluid, through which the vessels of wizardry, the great censers and alembics and braziers, seemed to quiver like animate things. A little past the room's center, his back to the doorway, Vacharn sat on an ebon trivet before the mirror of clairvoyance, which was wrought from electrum in the form of a huge delta; and was held obliquely aloft by a serpentining copper arm. The mirror flamed brightly in the shadow, as if lit by some splendor of unknown source; and the intruders were dazzled by glimpsing of its radiance as they went forward.\n\nIt seemed that Vacharn had indeed been overcome by the wonted trance, for he peered rigidly into the mirror, immobile as a seated mummy. The brothers held back, while Yadar, thinking them close behind him, stole toward the necromancer with lifted blade. As he drew nearer, he perceived that Vacharn held a great scimitar across his knees; and, deeming that the sorcerer was perhaps forewarned, Yadar ran quickly up behind him and aimed a powerful stroke at his neck. But, even while he aimed, his eyes were blinded by the strange brightness of the mirror, as though a sun had blazed into them from its depth across the shoulder of Vacharn; and the blade swerved and bit slantingly into the collar-bone, so that the necromancer, though sorely wounded, was saved from decapitation.\n\nNow it seemed likely that Vacharn had foreknown the attempt to slay him, and had thought to do battle with his assailers when they came. But, sitting at the mirror in pretended trance, he had no doubt been overpowered against his will by the weird brilliance, and had fallen into a mantic slumber.\n\nFierce and swift as a wounded tiger, he leapt from the trivet, swinging his scimitar aloft as he tumed upon Yadar. The prince, still blinded, could neither strike again nor avoid the stroke of Vacharn; and the scimitar clove deeply into his right shoulder, and he fell mortally wounded and lay with his head upheld a little against the base of the snakish copper arm that supported the mirror.\n\nLying there, with his life ebbing slowly, he beheld how Vokal sprang forward as with the desperation of one who sees imminent death, and hewed mightily into the neck of Vacharn. The head, almost sundered from the body, toppled and hung by a strip of flesh and skin: yet Vacharn, reeling, did not fall or die at once, as any mortal man should have done: but, still animated by the wizard power within him, he ran about the chamber, striking great blows at the parricides. Blood gushed from his neck like a fountain as he ran; and his head swung to and fro like a monstrous pendulum on his breast. And all his blows went wild because he could no longer see to direct them, and his sons avoided him agilely, hewing into him oftentimes as he went past. And sometimes he stumbled over the fallen Yadar, or struck the mirror of electrum with his sword, making it ring like a deep bell. And sometimes the battle passed beyond sight of the dying prince, toward the window that looked seaward; and he heard the strange crashings, as if some of the magic furniture were shattered by the strokes of the warlock; and there were loud breathings from the sons of Vacharn, and the dull sound of blows that went home as they still pursued their father. And anon the fight returned before Yadar, and he watched it with dimming eyes.\n\nDire beyond telling was that combat, and Vokal and Uldulla panted like spent runners ere the end. But, after a while, the power seemed to fail in Vacharn with the draining of his life-blood. He staggered from side to side as he ran and his paces halted, and his blows became enfeebled. His raiment hung upon him in blood-soaked rags from the slashings of his sons, and certain of his members were half sundered, and his whole body was hacked and overscored like an executioner's block. At last, with a dexterous blow, Vokal severed the thin strip by which the head still depended; and the head dropped and rolled with many reboundings about the floor.\n\nThen, with a wild tottering, as if still fain to stand erect, the body of Vacharn toppled down and lay thrashing like a great, headless fowl, heaving itself up and dropping back again, incessantly. Never, with all its rearings, did the body quite regain its feet: but the scimitar was still held firmly in the right hand, and the corpse laid blindly about it, striking from the floor with sidelong slashes, or slicing down as it rose half-way to a standing posture. And the head still rolled, unresting, about the chamber, and maledictions came from its mouth in a pipy voice no louder than that of a child.\n\nAt this, Yadar saw that Vokal and Uldulla drew back, as if somewhat aghast; and they turned toward the door, manifestly intending to quite the room. But before Vokal, going first had lifted the portal-arras, there slithered beneath its folds the long, black, snakish body of the weaselfamiliar, Esrit. And the familiar launched itself in air, reaching at one bound the throat of Vokal; and it clung there with teeth fastened to his flesh, sucking his blood steadily, while he staggered about the room and strove in vain to tear it away with maddened fingers.\n\nUldulla, it seemed, would have made some attenpt to kill the creature, for he cried out, adjuring Vokal to stand firm, and raised his sword as if waiting for a chance to strike at Esrit. But Vokal seemed to hear him not, or was too frenzied to obey his adjuration. And at that instant the head of Vachara, in its rolling, bounded against Uldulla's feet; and the head, snarling ferociously, caught the hem of his robe with its teeth and hung there as he sprang back in panic fright. And though he sliced wildly at the head with his scimitar, the teeth refused to relinquish their hold. So he dropped his garment, and leaving it there with the still pendant head of his father, he fled naked from the room. And even as Uldulla fled, the life departed from Yadar, and he saw and heard no more...\n\nDimly, from the depths of oblivion, Yadar beheld the flaring of remote lights, and heard the chanting of a far voice. It seemed that he swam upward from black seas toward the voice and the lights, and he saw as if through a thin, watery film the face of Uldulla standing above him, and the fuming of strange vessels in the chamber of Vacharn. And it seemed that Uldulla said to him: 'Arise from death, and be obedient in all things to me the master.'\n\nSo, in answer to the unholy rites and incantations of necromancy, Yadar arose to such life as was possible for a resurrected lich. And he walked again, with the black gore of his wound in a great clot on his shoulder and breast, and made reply to Uldulla in the fashion of the living dead. Vaguely, and as matters of no import, he remembered something of his death and the circumstances preceding it; and vainly, with filmed eyes, in the wrecked chamber, he looked for the sundered head and body of Vacharn, and for Vokal and the weasel-demon.\n\nThen it seemed that Uldulla said to him: \"Follow me,\" and he went forth with the necromancer into the light of the red, swollen moon that had soared from the Black River upon Naat. There, on the fell before the house, was a vast heap of ashes where coals glowed and glared like living eyes. Uldulla stood in contemplation before the heap; and Yadar stood beside him, knowing not that he gazed on the burnt-out pyre of Vacharn and Vokal, which the dead slaves had built and fired at Uldulla's direction.\n\nThen, with shrill, eery wailings, a wind came suddenly from the sea, and lifting all the ashes and sparks in a great, swirling cloud, it swept them upon Yadar and the necromancer. The twain could hardly stand against that wind, and their hair and beards and garments were filled with the leavings of the pyre, and both were blinded thereby. Then the wind went up, sweeping the cloud of ashes over the mansion and into its doorways and windows; and through all its apartments. And for many days thereafter, little swirls of ash rose up under the feet of those who passed along the halls; and though there was a daily plying of besoms by the dead at Uldulla's injunction, it seemed that the place was never again wholly clean of those ashes...\n\nRegarding Uldulla, there remains little enough to be told: for his lordship over the dead was a brief thing. Abiding always alone, except for those liches who attended him, he became possessed by a weird melancholy that turned quickly toward madness. No longer could he conceive the aims and objects of life; and the languor of death rose up around him like a black, stealthy sea, full of soft murmurs and shadow-like arms that were fain to draw him downward. Soon he came to envy the dead, and to deem their lot desirable above any other. So carrying that scimitar he had used at the slaying of Vacharn, he went into his father's chamber, which he had not entered since the raising up of Prince Yadar. There, beside the sun-bright mirror of divinations, he disembowled himself, and fell amid the dust and the cobwebs that had gathered heavily over all. And, since there was no other necromancer to bring him back even to a semblance of life, he lay rotting and undisturbed for ever after.\n\nBut in the gardens of Vacharn the dead people still labored, heedless of Uldulla's passing; and they still kept the goats and cattle, and dived for pearls in the dark, torrent And Yadar, being with Dalili in that state now common to them both, was drawn to her with a ghostly yearning; and he felt a ghostly comfort in her nearness. The quick despair that had racked him aforetime, and the long torments of desire and separation, were as things faced and forgot; and he shared with Dalili a shadowy love and a dim contentment.",

"死寂的渴望，永远与痛苦分离：\n那幽影萦绕的爱恋何等朦胧甜美，\n逝去恋人们在纳特证明的幸福，\n远在漆黑汪洋之外。\n\n——《桨奴之歌》\n\n亚达尔是半沙漠地带兹拉游牧部落的王子，他追随着比破碎蛛丝更飘渺的线索穿越诸多王国。整整十三个月，他都在寻找未婚妻达莉莉——当他和部族猎手们在兹拉草原追猎黑羚羊时，沙拉格的奴隶贩子们如沙漠猎隼般迅捷狡诈地劫走了营地里的九名少女。当亚达尔黄昏归来目睹遭洗劫的帐篷时，他的悲痛与怒火比沙漠风暴更猛烈。那时他便立下重誓：无论达莉莉被卖到奴隶市场、妓院还是后宫，无论生死，无论要耗费多少年岁，他定要找到她。\n\n伪装成地毯商人的亚达尔带着四名同样打扮的随从，仅凭市集流言指引，走遍了左西克大陆各都城。随从们接连死于怪病或旅途艰险。经历无数次徒劳奔波后，他独自来到了西拉克王国西部海港奥罗斯。\n\n在这里他听到了可能与达莉莉有关的传闻——奥罗斯居民仍在议论某艘华丽桨帆船载着一位符合达莉莉特征的外族少女启航。那少女被西拉克皇帝买下，作为缔结盟约的礼物送给遥远的南方国度约罗斯的统治者。\n\n重燃希望的亚达尔登上了前往约罗斯的商船。这艘运载谷物与酒浆的小型桨帆船惯于紧贴左西克西海岸航行，从不驶入远海。启航那日碧空如洗，所有征兆都预示平安旅程。但离港第三日黎明，当他们正沿着低矮海岸航行时，突然刮起狂暴飓风。伴随遮天蔽日的漆黑云团，船只被卷入盲目风暴，彻底迷失了方向。\n\n两日后狂风平息为模糊低语，天空重现澄澈碧蓝。但视野内唯有怒涛汹涌的无边水域，逆着诡异西向急流，桨帆船完全无力回航。作为船上唯一乘客，亚达尔注意到船长与水手们惨白的恐惧神色。此时海水正以肉眼可见的速度变得暗沉，最终呈现出混着黑色的陈血色泽——尽管头顶阳光依然明亮。\n\n他向航行四十载的灰须老船长阿戈尔询问，得到这样的回答：\"当风暴将我们西推时我就明白了：我们落入了水手们称为'黑河'的恐怖洋流。这水流永远朝着太阳沉沦的终极之地奔涌，最终将从世界边缘倾泻而下。此刻我们与末日深渊之间，唯余邪恶的纳特岛——亦称死灵法师之岛。我不知道在那诅咒之岛失事，或是随瀑布坠入虚空，哪种命运更可怖。活人一旦抵达这两处就永无归途。而纳特岛除了盘踞其上的邪术师，只有被他们巫术操控的复生死者能够离开。那些死灵法师乘着逆黑河而上的魔船随意航行，而复生的尸体能在水下日夜不休执行他们最邪恶的差遣。\"\n\n对死灵法术知之甚少的亚达尔将信将疑。但望着愈发狂野的黑色洋流，他明白桨帆船已无望回归南方航线。最令他痛苦的是永远无法抵达约罗斯——那个他梦想找回达莉莉的国度。\n\n整日整夜，船只被诡异海流裹挟着，在无云晴空下驶向橙红落日，又迎来琥珀色黎明。当亚达尔再次发现陆地踪影时，夕阳正将那座岛屿映照成拔地而起的险峻黑影。无需水手们惊恐的尖叫提醒，他也知道这就是恐怖的纳特岛。\n\n洋流在与礁石密布的海岸搏斗时变得愈发凶猛。亚达尔站在船首，如海鹰般锐利的目光扫过嶙峋峭壁、向海延伸的幽暗森林，以及阴影笼罩的海滩上翻卷的巨浪白沫。整座岛屿笼罩着不祥的死亡气息，他的心像坠入无光深渊的铅锤般沉落。\n\n当桨帆船被暗礁撞碎时，亚达尔是唯一及时跳船的幸存者。不谙水性的他很快被漩涡吞噬。在濒临窒息的混沌中，他恍惚看见达莉莉的面容如往昔阳光般浮现。当他再度恢复意识时，正被一具冰冷的女体托出海面。\n\n这女子有着惊人的力量，能轻松驾驭可怖的浪涛。当最终被冲上岸时，亚达尔发现救他的女子始终沉默不语。她引领他走向暮色中蓝焰诡异的篝火，火光映照出三名正在吟唱的瘦高黑袍人——他们凹陷的眼窝里跳动着火焰的反光，如同饿殍般可怖。\n\n女子向诵经者躬身行礼时，摇曳的火光终于照亮她的面容。亚达尔的心脏几乎停跳：那正是他朝思暮想的达莉莉！他呼喊着扑向爱人，却只触到一具冰冷僵硬的躯体。她回应他名字的声音飘渺如隔世，美丽的眼眸里只有梦游者般的空洞。\n\n\"你真的是达莉莉吗？\"\n\"我是达莉莉。\"她梦呓般回应，如同复读他话语的回声。\n\n当亚达尔紧拥着爱人诉说多年追寻时，一只枯瘦的手突然扣住他的肩膀。三名死灵法师不知何时已结束吟唱，其中一人用左西克通用语嘶声道：\"欢迎来到纳特岛。\"\n\n雅达尔怀着不祥的预感，厉声质问那人：\"尔等究竟是何等存在？达莉莉为何在此？尔等对她做了什么？\"\n\n\"吾乃死灵法师瓦查恩，\"那人答道，\"身边这两位是犬子沃卡尔与乌尔杜拉，亦通晓通幽之术。吾等居于峭壁后的宅邸，由巫术从深海唤起的溺亡者侍奉左右。这姑娘达莉莉与她那艘从奥罗斯启航的全体船员，皆在奴仆之列。与尔后来乘坐的船只一样，那艘船被黑潮卷至远方，最终在纳特岛的暗礁上撞毁。吾与犬子无需魔法阵辅助，仅凭咒语便将溺亡者召唤上岸——正如方才号令那具死尸泳者，将尔从另一艘船的罹难者中单独救起。\"\n\n瓦查恩语毕，凝神望向暮色深处。雅达尔听见身后传来缓慢的脚步声，正从浪花翻涌的卵石滩逐渐逼近。转身时，他看见载他来纳特岛的那艘帆船老船长，正从铅灰色的暮光中浮现，身后跟随着全体水手与桨手。这些梦游者般的身影向篝火蹒跚而来，海水从他们的衣衫发梢不断滴落，自嘴角汩汩流淌。有人遍体鳞伤，有人拖着被礁石撞断的残肢，面容凝固着溺亡者特有的痛苦神情。\n\n他们如傀儡般僵硬地向瓦查恩父子行礼，以此承认被死灵法师从永恒长眠中唤醒的奴役身份。玻璃珠似的眼珠对雅达尔毫无反应，对外界亦无感知，仅在被问及某些晦涩词句时，才会发出呆板的应答。\n\n雅达尔恍若自己也化作行尸走肉，在黑暗空洞的半梦半醒间游荡。当死灵法师领着他穿过蜿蜒通向纳特高地的幽谷时，寻获达莉莉的喜悦早已被病态的绝望侵蚀殆尽。\n\n瓦查恩举着从篝火中取出的浮木火把引路。肿胀的月亮如溃烂的血疮升起在狂怒的海面上，未等月轮褪成死尸般的惨白，他们已走出峡谷，来到三位死灵法师矗立在石原上的宅邸前。\n\n这座由黑花岗岩筑成的建筑伸展着低矮侧翼，如匍匐在茂密柏树间的野兽。后方悬崖高悬，月光为层层叠叠的山脊披上阴郁的尸衣，绵延至纳特岛中央的群山深处。\n\n整座宅邸仿佛被死亡独占：门窗不见灯火，沉寂与苍白的夜空融为一体。但当巫师们临近门槛时，瓦查恩念出的咒语在厅堂深处激起回响。霎时间无数灯火如妖异的黄瞳亮起，门廊内倏然浮现出鞠躬的幽影——这些生物的面孔泛着墓穴特有的惨白，有些还点缀着霉绿的腐斑或蛆虫啃噬的蜿蜒痕迹......\n\n雅达尔被引入大厅，受邀坐在瓦查恩父子平日独享的高台石桌前。下方主厅聚集着近四十名亡者，达莉莉位列其中，却始终不曾望向雅达尔。他本欲靠近她，却发现自己被莫名的倦意笼罩，仿佛无形的咒语已禁锢四肢，使他丧失行动之力。\n\n他木然与阴郁沉默的主人们同坐——这些常年与亡者为伴者，早已沾染死寂之气。此刻他更清晰地察觉到三人的相似：他们不像父子倒似同胞兄弟，都有着超越凡俗年龄的特质。那种自三人身上散发的诡异邪恶，如同隐秘死亡的气息般令人作呕。\n\n在精神桎梏下，雅达尔对诡异的晚餐仪式已不觉惊诧：肉食凭空出现，美酒自行倾注，侍从的踪迹仅由可疑的脚步声与忽现的寒意暴露。\n\n亡者们以僵硬的姿态开始进食。而死灵法师们却静待着什么，瓦查恩对游牧者说道：\"今夜另有贵客同席。\"雅达尔这才注意到瓦查恩座位旁摆着空椅。\n\n不久内厅门廊出现一个近乎全裸的黝黑巨汉，暴突的眼珠充满狂怒与恐惧，紫色厚唇沾满白沫。两名持锈弯刀的死灵水手如押解囚犯般紧随其后。\n\n\"此乃食人族。\"瓦查恩说，\"奴仆们从山外森林捕获了他，那里聚居着此类蛮族。\"他补充道：\"唯有强者才配活着踏入此宅......雅达尔王子，汝被选中绝非偶然。仔细看好了。\"\n\n蛮人在门槛处迟疑，似乎更畏惧厅内众人而非守卫的武器。当锈刃在他左肩劈出深可见骨的伤口后，他才抽搐着向前挪动，如同受惊的野兽般疯狂环顾逃生之路。直到第二次催促，他才颤抖着登上高台。随着瓦查恩念出空洞的咒文，这蛮人最终战栗着入座，身后矗立着已死亡半月之久的可怖守卫。\n\n\"尚有一位客人，\"瓦查恩说，\"他稍候便至，吾等无需等候。\"\n\n没有更多仪式，他开始进食。雅达尔虽毫无食欲，也只能效仿。王子几乎尝不出盘中珍馐的滋味，亦辨不出酒液的酸甜。他的思绪在达莉莉与周遭恐怖间来回撕扯。\n\n饮食间他的感官诡异地敏锐起来，察觉到灯影间游移的怪诞阴影，听见令血液凝固的冰冷私语。大厅里飘荡着介于新死与腐坏之间的各种尸臭。瓦查恩父子对此习以为常，而那食人族仍恐惧得拒绝进食。鲜血从他肩头两道伤口不断涌出，在石板上敲出清晰的滴答声。\n\n最终在瓦查恩用蛮语劝说下，他勉强饮下一杯夜茄花般深紫的酒液——这与其他人饮用的罂粟红截然不同。刚沾唇此人便如中风般瘫倒，僵直的手指仍紧攥酒杯，圆睁的双眼显示意识尚未消散。\n\n雅达尔顿生悚然猜疑，再不敢碰巫师们的饮食。当主人们突然停止进食，齐望向瓦查恩身后某处时，他顺着视线发现石板地上有个小洞。瓦查恩朗声唤出\"埃斯瑞特\"之名，洞中随即亮起两点火星。\n\n一只鼬形生物窜出，锈黑皮毛覆盖着蛇般扭动的身躯，无毛的前爪似人手，燃烧的黄眼蕴藏恶魔的恶意。它先贪婪舔食地上积血，继而跃上蛮人膝盖，最终攀附在那道最深伤口上如吸血水蛭般吮吸起来。\n\n当这生物开始吸血时，蛮人肌肉以肉眼可见的速度萎缩，很快变得如同老木乃伊般干瘪。而吸血的怪物仅如鼬吸鸡血般略微膨胀——雅达尔由此确信此乃瓦查恩驱使的恶魔。\n\n从此雅达尔在死灵之宅开始了诡异的生活。初次晚宴中的邪恶桎梏始终笼罩着他，行动如陷梦魇。他逐渐了解死灵法师们的生存方式：每月满月时，那只名为埃斯瑞特的恶魔仆从都要吸食一名健壮活人的鲜血。雅达尔明白若无奇迹，自己的生命将终结于下个满月——因为整座宅邸除他与主人外，皆为已渡冥河之亡魂......\n\n这座孤宅远离尘嚣。纳特岛沿岸虽另有死灵法师，却与瓦查恩一家鲜少往来。岛中央险峻山峦后方，只有互相征战的食人部族栖息在黑松林间。\n\n亡者们夜间躺在宅后岩窟的石棺中，白昼则复活履行各种职责：有的在背风坡耕种石质园圃，有的放牧黑山羊与牛群，更有被派往凶险海域采珠的潜水者——那些布满花岗岩岬角的荒凉环礁，活人绝不敢涉足。经年累月，瓦查恩积攒了大量珍珠，偶尔会率亡者船员逆黑潮航行至佐西克贸易。\n\n看着昔日旅伴如行尸走肉般穿梭，雅达尔倍感凄凉。而与达莉莉的每次交谈，都像隔着比死灵之岛周围永恒怒潮更可怕的深渊——他徒劳地想唤醒那颗沉入遗忘深渊的心，却只尝到苦涩与哀伤的微甜。\n\n自幼在兹拉沉湖中泅泳的达莉莉，被迫成为采珠人中的一员。亚达常伴她至岸边，等待她从狂澜中归来；有时他几乎克制不住追随她跃入水中的冲动，去寻求——倘若可能——终极死亡的安宁。若非身处诡异困境，被灰暗巫术罗网所困，使他昔日的刚毅决断荡然无存，他必已付诸行动。\n\n月末某日黄昏，当达莉莉在激流深处潜游时，沃卡尔与乌尔杜拉走近伫立在岩壁海滩上等候的王子。二人不发一言，以隐秘手势示意；亚达怀着模糊好奇，任由他们引领自己离开海滩，沿着蜿蜒海岬间险峻小径攀行。夜幕降临前，他们抵达一处与世隔绝的隐秘港湾——这游牧民族从未知晓的存在。在岛屿幽深阴影笼罩的平静海湾里，停泊着一艘悬挂暗紫帆布的桨帆船，酷似亚达曾在黑河逆潮中瞥见的那艘驶向佐西克的诡船。\n\n亚达满腹疑窦，既不解二人带他来此的用意，亦不明他们指向怪船时手势的含义。此刻沃卡尔压低嗓音，仿佛在这荒僻处仍怕人窃听般对他耳语：\n\n\"若愿协助我兄弟实施某项计划，汝可乘那艘桨帆船逃离纳特岛。若有意，还可带走达莉莉姑娘，并驱使若干亡者水手划桨。凭借我等召唤的强风助力，汝可逆黑河而上重返佐西克...若拒绝相助，鼬精埃斯瑞特将吸尽汝周身血液；达莉莉则永为瓦查恩的奴隶，白日为贪欲在幽暗深水采珠...夜晚或还需满足其淫欲。\"\n\n沃卡尔的承诺令亚达心中希望与男子气概稍振，瓦查恩的恶毒巫术似从脑海消退；而沃卡尔的暗示更激起他对暴君的愤慨。他当即应道：\"凡吾力所能及，必助汝等成事。\"\n\n乌尔杜拉频频回首张望，接续这隐秘低语：\"吾等以为瓦查恩早逾寿限，专制统治过久。身为子嗣，吾辈渐衰：理当在衰老前继承父亲积攒的财宝与魔法霸权。故需汝协助诛杀瓦查恩。\"\n\n亚达略加思索，认定诛杀死灵法师实属正义之举，无损勇武与尊严，遂毫不迟疑道：\"吾愿相助。\"\n\n见亚达应允，沃卡尔胆气倍增，续道：\"此事须于明晚前完成——届时黑河满月将临纳特岛，鼬魔埃斯瑞特亦将出洞。唯明日午前，瓦查恩于镜前出神之际，方是偷袭良机。彼时他必如常凝视映现外海幻象的魔镜，吾等须在其回神前速下杀手。\"\n\n行动时分，手持寒光弯刀的兄弟在外厅与亚达会合。沃卡尔另持一柄铭刻致命咒文的妖刀相赠，王子却执意用惯用佩剑。三人潜行至瓦查恩房前，但见黑帷幕绣银夜徽，缘饰魔王撒旦猩红名讳五次重复。兄弟逡巡不敢掀帘，亚达却毅然拨帷而入。\n\n高穹顶房间幽暗朦胧，未修剪的柏枝间透进晦暗海光。无数灯盏未燃，巫术器皿在幽灵般的阴影中颤动。房间深处，瓦查恩背对门口，端坐黑铁三脚凳上，凝视蛇形铜臂斜支的巨三角魔镜。镜面在暗处诡异地炽亮，闯入者被其光芒所眩。\n\n瓦查恩似已陷入惯常出神状态，僵坐如木乃伊。兄弟畏缩不前，亚达却以为他们紧随其后，举剑潜近。及至察觉术士膝上横置弯刀，疑其有备，亚达急趋身后猛斩其颈。不料镜中异光骤亮如烈日灼目，剑锋偏斜劈入锁骨。重伤的瓦查恩虽免于斩首，却如伤虎暴起，回身挥刀重创王子右肩。濒死的亚达倚着镜架铜基，目睹沃卡尔拼死扑上，几乎斩断瓦查恩脖颈。\n\n匪夷所思的是，头颅仅凭皮肉悬垂的瓦查恩竟未立即毙命，反在房中狂奔挥砍。鲜血如泉喷涌，断首在胸前钟摆般摇晃。盲目攻击屡屡落空，两子敏捷闪避，伺机反劈。垂死王子朦胧视线中，这场可怖鏖战持续良久，直至沃卡尔最终斩断最后筋肉，头颅砰然坠地。\n\n无头身躯仍如斩首雄鸡般抽搐挣扎，断首则在房中滚动，发出幼童般的尖细诅咒。正欲逃离的兄弟遭鼬魔埃斯瑞特突袭，沃卡尔被咬住咽喉吸血，乌尔杜拉则被父亲头颅咬住衣摆。最终乌尔杜拉弃袍裸逃，而亚达气绝身亡......\n\n自混沌深渊中，亚达隐约见遥光闪烁，闻远方吟诵。他似从黑海浮向声光处，透过水膜般瞥见乌尔杜拉俯视的面容，以及瓦查恩房中蒸腾的奇诡器皿。乌尔杜拉对他说道：\"自死亡中崛起，遵吾为主。\"\n\n于是，响应亵渎的复活仪式，亚达作为还魂尸重获行动能力。他肩胸凝结黑血，以亡者姿态应答。残破房间里，他浑浊目光徒然搜寻瓦查恩残躯、沃卡尔与鼬魔踪迹。\n\n乌尔杜拉引他来到黑河红月下的屋前空地。灰堆中余烬如活眼闪烁——这是奴隶们奉命焚化瓦查恩与沃卡尔的火葬堆。突然海风尖啸，卷起灰烬笼罩二人。此后多日，宅邸走廊总有无名灰旋升起，纵使亡奴日日清扫，那些灰烬却永难除尽......\n\n至于乌尔杜拉，其统治亡者的时光短暂可述。终日独处使他陷入迅速恶化的癫狂忧郁。生命意义于他再无意义，死亡的倦怠如黑海暗潮般裹挟而来。最终他携弑父弯刀重返父亲房间，在积尘厚重的占卜镜前剖腹自尽。因再无死灵法师施术，其尸身永远腐朽于蛛网尘埃之中。\n\n瓦查恩花园中，亡奴们依旧牧羊饲牛，在幽暗激流中采珠。亚达与达莉莉以亡者形态相伴，彼此吸引着缥缈渴望。往昔折磨他的绝望与相思之苦，皆成淡忘的幻影。他们共享着幽冥之爱与朦胧满足。"

        "content": "\n\nLet the grape yield for us its purple flame,And rosy love put off its maidenhood:By blackening moons, in lands without a name,We slew the Incubus and all his brood.   — Song of King Hoaraph’s Bowmen\n\nZobal the archer and Cushara the pikebearer had poured many a libation to their friendship in the sanguine liquors of Yoros and the blood of the kingdom’s enemies. In that long and lusty amity, broken only by such passing quarrels as concerned the division of a wine-skin or the apportioning of a wench, they had served amid the soldiery of King Hoaraph for a strenuous decade. Savage warfare and wild, fantastic hazard had been their lot. The renown of their valor had drawn upon them, ultimately, the honor of Hoaraph’s attention, and he had assigned them for duty among the picked warriors that guarded his palace in Faraad. And sometimes the twain were sent together on such missions as required no common hardihood and no disputable fealty to the king.\n\nNow, in company with the eunuch Simban, chief purveyor to Hoaraph’s well-replenished harem, Zobal and Cushara had gone on a tedious journey through the tract known as Izdrel, which clove the western part of Yoros asunder with its rusty-colored wedge of desolation. The king had sent them to learn if haply there abode any verity in certain travelers’ tales, which concerned a young maiden of celestial beauty who had been seen among the pastoral peoples beyond Izdrel. Simban bore at his girdle a bag of gold coins with which, if the girl’s pulchritude should be in any wise commensurate with the renown thereof, he was empowered to bargain for her purchase. The king had deemed that Zobal and Cushara should form an escort equal to all contingencies: for Izdrel was a land reputedly free of robbers, or, indeed, of any human inhabitants. Men said, however, that malign goblins, tall as giants and humped like camels, had oftentimes beset the wayfarers through Izdrel, that fair but ill-meaning lamiae had lured them to an eldritch death. Simban, quaking corpulently in his saddle, rode with small willingness on that outward journey; but the archer and the pike bearer, full of wholesome skepticism, divided their bawdy jests between the timid eunuch and the elusive demons.\n\nWithout other mishap than the rupturing of a wine-skin from the force of the new vintage it contained, they came to the verdurous pasture-lands beyond that dreary desert. Here, in low valleys that held the middle meanderings of the river Vos, cattle and dromedaries were kept by a tribe of herders who sent biannual tribute to Hoaraph from their teeming droves. Simban and his companions found the girl, who dwelt with her grandmother in a village beside the Vos; and even the eunuch acknowledged that their journey was well rewarded.\n\nCushara and Zobal, on their part, were instantly smitten by the charms of the maiden, whose name was Rubalsa. She was slender and of queenly height, and her skin was pale as the petals of white poppies; and the undulant blackness of her heavy hair was full of sullen copper gleamings beneath the sun. While Simban haggled shrilly with the cronelike grandmother, the warriors eyed Rubalsa with circumspect ardor and addressed to her such gallantries as they deemed discreet within hearing of the eunuch.\n\nAt last the bargain was driven and the price paid, to the sore depletion of Simban’s moneybag. Simban was now eager to return to Faraad with his prize, and he seemed to have forgotten his fear of the haunted desert. Zobal and Cushara were routed from their dreams by the impatient eunuch before dawn; and the three departed with the still drowsy Rubalsa ere the village could awaken about them.\n\nNoon, with its sun of candent copper in a blackish-blue zenith, found them far amid the rusty sands and iron-toothed ridges of Izdrel. The route they followed was little more than a footpath: for, though Izdrel was but thirty miles in width at that point, few travelers would dare those fiend-infested leagues; and most preferred an immensely circuitous road, used by the herders, that ran to the southward of that evil desolation, following the Vos nearly to its debouchment in the Indaskian Sea.\n\nCushara, splendid in his plate-armor of bronze, on a huge piebald mare with a cataphract of leather scaled with copper, led the cavalcade. Rubalsa, who wore the red homespun of the herders’ women, followed on a black gelding with silk and silver harness, which Hoaraph had sent for her use. Close behind her came the watchful eunuch, gorgeous in particolored sendal, and mounted ponderously, with swollen saddlebags all about him, on the gray ass of uncertain age which, through his fear of horses and camels, he insisted on riding at all times. In his hand he held the leading-rope of another ass which was nearly crushed to the ground by the wine-skins, water-jugs and other provisions. Zobal guarded the rear, with unslung bow, slim and wiry in his suiting of light chain mail, on a nervous stallion that chafed incessantly at the rein. At his back he bore a quiver filled with arrows which the court sorcerer, Amdok, had prepared with singular spells and dippings in doubtful fluids, for his possible use against demons. Zobal had accepted the arrows courteously but had satisfied himself later that their iron barbs were in no wise impaired by Amdok’s treatment. A similarly ensorceled pike had been offered by Amdok to Cushara, who had refused it bluffly, saying that his own well-tried weapon was equal to the spitting of any number of devils.\n\nBecause of Simban and the two asses, the party could make little speed. However, they hoped to cross the wilder and more desolate portion of Izdrel ere night. Simban, though he still eyed the dismal waste dubiously, was plainly more concerned with his precious charge than with the imagined imps and lamiae. And Cushara and Zobal, both rapt in amorous reveries that centered about the luscious Rubalsa, gave only a perfunctory attention to their surroundings.\n\nThe girl had ridden all morning in demure silence. Now, suddenly, she cried out in a voice whose sweetness was made shrill by alarm. The others reined their mounts, and Simban babbled questions. To these Rubalsa replied by pointing toward the southern horizon, where, as her companions now saw, a peculiar pitch-black darkness had covered a great portion of the sky and hills, obliterating them wholly. This darkness, which seemed due neither to cloud nor sandstorm, extended itself in a crescent on either hand, and came swiftly toward the travelers. In the course of a minute or less, it had blotted the pathway before and behind them like a black mist; and the two arcs of shadow, racing northward, had flowed together, immuring the party in a circle. The darkness then became stationary, its walls no more than a hundred feet away on every side. Sheer, impenetrable, it surrounded the wayfarers, leaving above them a clear space from which the sun still glared down, remote and small and discolored, as if seen from the bottom of a deep pit.\n\n“Ai! ai! ai!” howled Simban, cowering amid his saddlebags. “I knew well that some devilry would overtake us.”\n\nAt the same moment the two asses began to bray loudly, and the horses, with a frantic neighing and squealing, trembled beneath their riders. Only with much cruel spurring could Zobal force his stallion forward beside Cushara’s mare.\n\n“Mayhap it is only some pestilential mist,” said Cushara.\n\n“Never have I seen such mist,” replied Zobal doubtfully. “And there are no vapors to be met with in Izdrel. Methinks it is like the smoke of the seven hells that men fable beneath Zothique.”\n\n“Shall we ride forward?” said Cushara. “I would learn whether or not a pike can penetrate that darkness.”\n\nCalling out some words of reassurance to Rubalsa, the twain sought to spur their mounts toward the murky wall. But, after a few swerving paces, the mare and the stallion balked wildly, sweating and snorting, and would go no farther. Cushara and Zobal dismounted and continued their advance on foot.\n\nNot knowing the source or nature of the phenomenon with which they had to deal, the two approached it warily. Zobal nocked an arrow to his string, and Cushara held the great bronze-headed pike before him as if charging an embattled foe. Both were more and more puzzled by the murkiness, which did not recede before them in the fashion of fog, but maintained its opacity when they were close upon it.\n\nCushara was about to thrust his weapon into the wall. Then, without the least prelude, there arose in the darkness, seemingly just before him, a horrible, multitudinous clamor as of drums, trumpets, cymbals, jangling armor, jarring voices, and mailed feet that tramped to and fro on the stony ground with a mighty clangor. As Cushara and Zobal drew back in amazement, the clamor swelled and spread, till it filled with a babel of warlike noises the whole circle of mysterious night that hemmed in the travelers.\n\n“Verily, we are sore beset,” shouted Cushara to his comrade as they went back to their horses. “It would seem that some king of the north has sent his myrmidons into Yoros.”\n\n“Yea,” said Zobal... “But it is strange that we saw them not ere the darkness came. And the darkness, surely, is no natural thing.”\n\nBefore Cushara could make any rejoinder, the martial clashings and shoutings ceased abruptly. All about it seemed that there was a rattling of innumerable sistra, a hissing of countless huge serpents, a raucous hooting of ill-omened birds that had foregathered by thousands. To these indescribably hideous sounds, the horses now added a continual screaming, and the asses a more frenzied braying, above which the outcries of Rubalsa and Simban were scarce audible.\n\nCushara and Zobal sought vainly to pacify their mounts and comfort the madly frightened girl. It was plain that no army of mortal men had beleaguered them: for the noises still changed from instant to instant, and they heard a most evil howling, and a roaring as of hellborn beasts that deafened them with its volume.\n\nNaught, however, was visible in the gloom, whose circle now began to move swiftly, without widening or contracting. To maintain their position in its center, the warriors and their charges were compelled to leave the path and to flee northwardly amid the harsh ridges and hollows. All around them the baleful noises continued, keeping, as it seemed, the same interval of distance.\n\nThe sun, slanting westward, no longer shone into that eerily moving pit, and a deep twilight enveloped the wanderers. Zobal and Cushara rode as closely beside Rubalsa as the rough ground permitted, straining their eyes constantly for any visible sign of the cohorts that seemed to encompass them. Both were filled with the darkest misgivings, for it had become all too manifest that supernatural powers were driving them astray in the untracked desert.\n\nMoment by moment the gross darkness seemed to close in; and there was a palpable eddying and seething as of monstrous forms behind its curtain. The horses stumbled over boulders and outcroppings of ore-sharp stone, and the grievously burdened asses were compelled to put forth an unheard-of speed to keep pace with the ever-shifting circle that menaced them with its horrid clamor. Rubalsa had ceased her outcries, as if overcome by exhaustion or resignation to the horror of her plight; and the shrill screeches of the eunuch had subsided into fearful wheezing and gasping.\n\nEver and anon, it seemed that great fiery eyes glared out of the gloom, floating close to earth or moving aloft at a gigantic height. Zobal began to shoot his enchanted arrows at these appearance, and the speeding of each bolt was hailed by an appalling outburst of Satanic laughters and ululations.\n\nIn such wise they went on, losing all measure of time and sense of orientation. The animals were galled and footsore. Simban was nigh dead from fright and fatigue; Rubalsa drooped in her saddle; and the warriors, awed and baffled by the predicament in which their weapons appeared useless, began to flag with a dull weariness.\n\n“Never again shall I doubt the legendry of Izdrel,” said Cushara gloomily.\n\n“It is in my mind that we have not long either to doubt or believe,” rejoined Zobal.\n\nTo add to their distress, the terrain grew rougher and steeper, and they climbed acclivitous hillsides and went down endlessly into drear valleys. Anon they came to a flat, open, pebbly space. There, all at once, it seemed that the pandemonium of evil noises drew back on every hand, receding and fading into faint, dubious whispers that died at a vast remove. Simultaneously, the circling night thinned out, and a few stars shone in the welkin, and the sharp-spined hills of the desert loomed starkly against a vermilion afterglow. The travelers paused and peered wonderingly at one another in a gloom that was no more than that of natural twilight.\n\n“What new devilry is this?” asked Cushara, hardly daring to believe that the hellish leaguers had vanished.\n\n“I know not,” said the archer, who was staring into the dusk.” “But here, mayhap, is one of the devils.”\n\nThe others now saw that a muffled figure was approaching them, bearing a lit lantern made of some kind of translucent horn. At some distance behind the figure, lights appeared suddenly in a square dark mass which none of the party had discerned before. This mass was evidently a large building with many windows.\n\nThe figure, drawing near, was revealed by the dim yellowish lantern as a black man of immense girth and tallness, garbed in a voluminous robe of saffron such as was worn by certain monkish orders, and crowned with the two-horned purple hat of an abbot. He was indeed a singular and unlooked-for apparition: for if any monasteries existed amid the barren reaches of Izdrel, they were hidden and unknown to the world. Zobal, however, searching his memory, recalled a vague tradition he had once heard concerning a chapter of negro monks that had flourished in Yoros many centuries ago. The chapter had long been extinct, and the very site of its monastery was forgotten. Nowadays there were few blacks anywhere in the kingdom, other than those who did duty as eunuchs guarding the seraglios of nobles and rich merchants\n\nThe animals began to display a certain uneasiness at the stranger’s approach.\n\n“Who art thou?” challenged Cushara, his fingers tightening on the haft of his weapon.\n\nThe black man grinned capaciously, showing rows of discolored teeth whose incisors were like those of a wild dog. His enormous unctuous jowls were creased by the grin into folds of amazing number and volume; and his eyes, deeply slanted and close together, seemed to wink perpetually in pouches that shook like ebon jellies. His nostrils flared prodigiously; his purple, rubbery lips drooled and quivered, and he licked them with a fat, red, salacious tongue before replying to Cushara’s question.\n\n“I am Ujuk, abbot of the monastery of Puthuum,” he said, in a thick voice of such extraordinary volume that it appeared almost to issue from the earth under his feet. “Methinks the night has overtaken you far from the route of travelers. I bid you welcome to our hospitality.”\n\n“Aye, the night took us betimes,” Cushara returned dryly. Neither he nor Zobal was reassured by the look of lust in the abbot’s obscenely twinkling eyes as he peered at Rubalsa. Moreover, they had now noted the excessive and disagreeable length of the dark nails on his huge hands and bare, splayed feet: nails that were curving, three-inch talons, sharp as those of some beast or bird of prey.\n\nIt seemed, however, that Rubalsa and Simban were less abhorrently impressed, or had not noticed these details: for both made haste to acknowledge the abbot’s proffer of hospitality and to urge acceptance upon the visibly reluctant warriors. To this urging, Zobal and Cushara yielded, both inwardly resolving to keep a close watch on all the actions and movements of the abbot of Puthuum.\n\nUjuk, holding the horn lantern aloft, conducted the travelers to that massive building whose lights they had discerned at no great distance. A ponderous gate of dark wood swung open silently at their approach, and they entered a spacious courtyard cobbled with worn, greasy-looking stones, and dimly illumined by torches in rusty iron sockets. Several monks appeared with startling suddenness before the travelers, who had thought the courtyard vacant at first glance. They were all of unusual bulk and stature, and their features possessed an extraordinary likeness to those of Ujuk, from whom, indeed, they could hardly have been distinguished save by the yellow cowls which they wore in lieu of the abbot’s horned purple hat. The similarity extended even to their curved and talon-like nails of inordinate length. Their movements were fantasmally furtive and silent. Without speaking, they took charge of the horses and asses. Cushara and Zobal relinquished their mounts to the care of these doubtful hostlers with a reluctance which, apparently, was not shared by Rubalsa or the eunuch.\n\nThe monks also signified a willingness to relieve Cushara of his heavy pike and Zobal of his ironwood bow and half-emptied quiver of ensorceled arrows. But at this the warriors balked, refusing to let the weapons pass from their possession.\n\nUjuk led them to an inner portal which gave admission to the refectory. It was a large, low room, lit by brazen lamps of antique workmanship, such as ghouls might have recovered from a desert-sunken tomb. The abbot, with ogre-like grinnings, besought his guests to take their place at a long massive table of ebony with chairs and benches of the same material.\n\nWhen they had seated themselves, Ujuk sat down at the table’s head. Immediately, four monks came in, bearing platters piled with spicily smoking viands, and deep earthen flagons full of a dark amber-brown liquor. And these monks, like those encountered in the courtyard, were gross ebon-black simulacra of their abbot, resembling him precisely in every feature and member. Zobal and Cushara were chary of tasting the liquor, which, for its odor, appeared to be an exceptionally potent kind of ale: for their doubts concerning Ujuk and his monastery grew graver every moment. Also, in spite of their hunger, they refrained from the food set before them, which consisted mainly of baked meats that neither could identify. Simban and Rubalsa, however, addressed themselves promptly to the meal with appetites sharpened by long fasting and the weird fatigues of the day.\n\nThe warriors observed that neither food nor drink had been placed before Ujuk, and they conjectured that he had already dined. To their growing disgust and anger, he sat lolling obesely, with lustful eyes upon Rubalsa in a stare broken only by the nictitations that accompanied his perpetual grinning. This stare soon began to abash the girl, and then to alarm and frighten her. She ceased eating; and Simban, who had been deeply preoccupied till then with his supper, was plainly perturbed when he saw the flagging of her appetite. He seemed for the first time to notice the abbot’s unmonastic leering, and showed his disapproval by sundry horrible grimaces. He also remarked pointedly, in a loud, piercing voice, that the girl was destined for the harem of King Hoaraph. But at this, Ujuk merely chuckled, as if Simban had uttered some exquisitely humorous jest.\n\nZobal and Cushara were hard put to repress their wrath, and both itched hotly for the fleshing of their weapons in the abbot’s gross bulk. He, however, seemed to have taken Simban’s hint, for he shifted his gaze from the girl. Instead, he began to eye the warriors with a curious and loathsome avidity, which they found little less insupportable than his ogling of Rubalsa. The well-nourished eunuch also came in for his share of Ujuk’s regard which seemed to have in it the hunger of a hyena gloating over his prospective prey.\n\nSimban, obviously ill at ease, and somewhat frightened, now tried to carry on a conversation with the abbot, volunteering much information as to himself, his companions, and the adventures which had brought them to Puthuum. Ujuk seemed little surprised by this information; and Zobal and Cushara, who took no part in the conversation, became surer than ever that he was no true abbot.\n\n“How far have we gone astray from the route to Faraad?” asked Simban.\n\n“I do not consider that you have gone astray,” rumbled Ujuk in his subterranean voice, “for your coming to Puthuum is most timely. We have few guests here, and we are loth to part with those who honor our hospitality.”\n\n“King Hoaraph will be impatient for our return with the girl,” Simban quavered. “We must depart early tomorrow.”\n\n“Tomorrow is another matter,” said Ujuk, in a tone half unctuous, half sinister. “Perhaps, by then, you will have forgotten this deplorable haste.”\n\nLittle was said during the rest of the meal; and, indeed, little was drunk or eaten; for even Simban seemed to have lost his normally voracious appetite. Ujuk, still grinning as if at some uproarious jest known only to himself, was apparently not concerned with the urging of food upon his guests.\n\nCertain of the monks came and went unbidden, removing the laden dishes, and as they departed, Zobal and Cushara perceived a strange thing: for no shadows were cast by the monks on the lamplit floor beside the moving adumbrations of the vessels they carried! From Ujuk, however, a heavy, misshapen umbrage fell and lay like a prone incubus beside his chair.\n\n“Methinks we have come to a hatching place of demons,” whispered Zobal to Cushara. “We have fought many men, thou and I, but never such as wanted wholesome shadows.”\n\n“Aye,” muttered the pike-bearer. “But I like this abbot even less than his monks: though he alone is the caster of a shade.”\n\nUjuk now rose from his seat, saying: “I trow that ye are all weary and would sleep betimes.”\n\nRubalsa and Simban, who had both drunk a certain amount of the powerful ale of Puthuum, nodded a drowsy assent. Zobal and Cushara, noting their premature sleepiness, were glad they had declined the liquor.\n\nThe abbot led his guests along a corridor whose gloom was but little relieved by the flaring of torches in a strong draft that blew stealthily from an undetermined source, causing a rout of wild shadows to flitter beside the passers. On either hand there were cells with portals shut only by hangings of a coarse hempen fabric. The monks had all vanished, the cells were seemingly dark, and an air of age-old desolation pervaded the monastery, together with a smell as of moldering bones piled in some secret catacomb.\n\nMidway in the hall, Ujuk paused and held aside the arras of a doorway that differed in no wise from the rest. Within, a lamp burned, depending from an archaic chain of curiously linked and fretted metal. The room was bare but spacious, and a bed of ebony with opulent quiltings of an olden fashion stood by the farther wall under an open window. This chamber, the abbot indicated, was for the occupancy of Rubalsa; and he then offered to show the men and the eunuch their respective quarters.\n\nSimban, seeming to wake all at once from his drowsiness, protested at the idea of being separated in such wise from his charge. As if Ujuk had been prepared for this, and had given orders accordingly, a monk appeared forthwith, bringing quilts which he laid on the flagged floor within the portals of Rubalsa’s room. Simban stretched himself promptly on the improvised bed, and the warriors withdrew with Ujuk.\n\n“Come,” said the abbot, his wolfish teeth gleaming in the torchlight. “Ye will sleep soundly in the beds I have prepared.”\n\nZobal and Cushara, however, had now assumed the position of guardsmen outside the doorway of Rubalsa’s chamber. They told Ujuk curtly that they were responsible to King Hoaraph for the girl’s safety and must watch over her at all times.\n\n“I wish ye a pleasant vigil,” said Ujuk, with a cachinnation like the laughter of hyenas in some underground tomb.\n\nWith his departure, it seemed that the black slumber of a dead antiquity settled upon all the building. Rubalsa and Simban, apparently, slept without stirring, for there was no sound from behind the hempen arras. The warriors spoke only in whispers, lest they should arouse the girl. Their weapons held ready for instant use, they watched the shadowy hall with a jealous vigilance: for they did not trust the quietude about them, being well assured that a host of foul cacodemons couched somewhere behind it, biding the time of assault.\n\nHowbeit, nothing occurred to reconfirm them in such apprehensions. The draft that breathed furtively along the hall seemed to tell only of age-forgotten death and cyclic solitude. The two began to perceive signs of dilapidation in walls and floor that had heretofore escaped their notice. Eery, fantastical thoughts came to them with insidious persuasion: it seemed that the building was a ruin that had lain uninhabited for a thousand years; that the black abbot Ujuk and his shadowless monks were mere imaginations, things that had never been; that the moving circle of darkness, the pandemonian voices, that had herded them toward Puthuum, were no more than a daymare whose memory was now fading in the fashion of dreams.\n\nThirst and hunger troubled them, for they had not eaten since early morn, and had snatched only a few hasty drafts of wine or water during the day. Both, however, began to feel the oncreeping of a sleepy hebetude which, under the circumstances, was most undesirable. They nodded, started and awoke recurrently to their peril. But still, like a siren voice in poppy-dreams, the silence seemed to tell them that all danger was a bygone thing, an illusion that belonged to yesterday.\n\nSeveral hours passed, and the hall lightened with the rising of a late moon that shone through a window at its eastern end. Zobal, less bedrowsed than Cushara, was awakened to full awareness by a sudden commotion among the animals in the courtyard without. There were neighings that rose to a frenzied pitch, as if something had frightened the horses; and to these the asses began to add their heavy braying, till Cushara was also aroused.\n\n“Make sure that thou drowsest not again,” Zobal admonished the pike-bearer. “I shall go forth and inquire as to the cause of this tumult.”\n\n“Tis a good thought,” commended Cushara. “And while thou art gone, see to it that none has molested our provisions. And bring back with thee some apricots and cakes of sesame and a skin of ruby-red wine.”\n\nThe monastery itself remained silent as Zobal went down the hall, his buskins of link-covered leather ringing faintly. At the hall’s end an outer door stood open, and he passed through it into the courtyard. Even as he, emerged, the animals ceased their clamor. He could see but dimly, for all the torches in the courtyard, save one, had burnt out or been extinguished; and the low gibbous moon had not yet climbed the wall. Nothing, to all appearance, was amiss: the two asses were standing quietly beside the mountainous piles of provisions and saddlebags they had borne; the horses seemed to drowse amicably in a group. Zobal decided that perhaps there had been some temporary bickering between his stallion and Cushara’s mare.\n\nHe went forward to make sure that there was no other cause of disturbance. Afterward he turned to the wineskins, intending to refresh himself before rejoining Cushara with a supply of drinkables and comestibles. Hardly had he washed the dust of Izdrel from his throat with a long draft, when he heard an eery, dry whispering whose source and distance he could not at once determine. Sometimes it seemed at his very ear, and then it ebbed away as if sinking into profound subterranean vaults. But the sound, though variable in this manner, never ceased entirely; and it seemed to shape itself into words that the listener almost understood: words that were fraught with the hopeless sorrow of a dead man who had sinned long ago, and had repented his sin through black sepulchral ages.\n\nAs he harkened to the sere anguish of that sound, the hair bristled on the archer’s neck, and he knew such fear as he had never known in the thick of battle. And yet, at the same time, he was aware of deeper pity than the pain of dying comrades had ever aroused in his heart. And it seemed that the voice implored him for commiseration and succor, laying upon him a weird compulsion that he dared not disobey. He could not wholly comprehend the things that the whisperer besought him to do: but somehow he must ease that desolate anguish.\n\nStill the whispering rose and fell; and Zobal forgot that he had left Cushara to a lone vigil beset with hellish dangers; forgot that the voice itself might well be only a device of demons to lure him astray. He began to search the courtyard, his keen ears alert for the source of the sound; and, after some dubitation, he decided that it issued from the ground in a corner opposite the gateway. Here, amid the cobbling, in the wall’s angle, he found a large slab of syenite with a rusty metal ring in its center. He was quickly confirmed in his decision: for the whispering became louder and more articulate, and he thought that it said to him: “Lift the slab.”\n\nThe archer grasped the rusty ring with both hands, and putting forth all his strength, he succeeded in tilting back the stone, albeit not without such exertion as made him feel that his very spine would crack. A dark opening was exposed, and from it surged a charnel stench so overpowering that Zobal turned his face away and was like to have vomited. But the whisper came with a sharp, woeful beseeching, out of the darkness below; and it said to him: “Descend.”\n\nZobal wrenched from its socket the one torch that still burned in the courtyard. By its lurid flaring he saw a flight of worn steps that went down into the reeking sepulchral gloom; and resolutely he descended the steps, finding himself at their bottom in a hewn vault with deep shelves of stone on either hand. The shelves, running away into darkness, were piled with human bones and mummified bodies; and plainly the place was the catacomb of the monastery.\n\nThe whispering had ceased, and Zobal peered about in bewilderment not unmixed with horror.\n\n“I am here,” resumed the dry, susurrous voice, issuing from amid the heaps of mortal remnants on the shelf close beside him. Startled, and feeling again that crisping of the hairs on his neck, Zobal held his torch to the low shelf as he looked for the speaker. In a narrow niche between stacks of disarticulated bones, he beheld a half-decayed corpse about whose long, attenuate limbs and hollow body there hung a few rotten shreds of yellow cloth. These, he thought, were the remnants of a robe such as was worn by the monks of Puthuum. Then, thrusting his torch into the niche, he discerned the lean, mummy-like head, on which moldered a thing that had once been the horned hat of an abbot. The corpse was black as ebony, and plainly it was that of a great negro. It bore an aspect of incredible age, as if it had lain there for centuries: but from it came the odor of newly ripe corruption that had sickened Zobal when he lifted the slab of syenite.\n\nAs he stood staring down, it seemed to Zobal that the cadaver stirred a little, as if fain to rise from its recumbent posture; and he saw a gleaming as of eyeballs in the deepshadowed sockets; and the dolorously curling lips were retracted still farther; and from between the bared teeth there issued that awful whispering which had drawn him into the catacomb.\n\n“Listen closely,” said the whispering. “There is much for me to tell thee, and much for thee to do when the telling is done.\n\n“I am Uldor, the abbot of Puthuum. More than a thousand years ago I came with my monks to Yoros from Ilcar, the black empire of the north. The emperor of Ilcar had driven us forth, for our cult of celibacy, our worship of the maiden goddess Ojhal, were hateful to him. Here amid the desert of Izdrel we built our monastery and dwelt unmolested.\n\n“We were many in number at first; but the years went by, and one by one the Brothers were laid in the catacomb we had delved for our resting place. They died with none to replace them. I alone survived in the end: for I had won such sanctity as ensures longevous days, and had also become a master of the arts of sorcery. Time was a demon that I held at bay, like one who stands in a charmed circle. My powers were still hale and unimpaired; and I lived on as an anchorite in the monastery.\n\n“At first the solitude was far from irksome to me, and I was wholly absorbed in my study of the arcana of nature. But after a time it seemed that such things no longer satisfied. I grew aware of my loneliness, and was much beset by the demons of the waste, who had troubled me little heretofore. Succubi, fair but baneful, lamiae with the round soft bodies of women, came to tempt me in the drear vigils of the night.\n\n“I resisted... But there was one she-devil, more cunning than the others, who crept into my cell in the semblance of a girl I had loved long ago, ere yet I had taken the vow of Ojhal. To her I succumbed; and of the unholy union was born the half-human fiend, Ujuk, who has since called himself the abbot of Puthuum.\n\n“After that sin, I wished to die... And the wish was manifoldly strengthened when I beheld the progeny of the sin. Too greatly, however, had I offended Ojhal; and a frightful penance was decreed for me. I lived... and daily I was plagued and persecuted by the monster, Ujuk, who grew lustily in the manner of such offspring. But when Ujuk had gained his full stature, there came upon me such weakness and decrepitude as made me hopeful of death. Scarce could I stir in my impotence, and Ujuk, taking advantage of this, bore me in his horrid arms to the catacomb and laid me among the dead. Here I have remained ever since, dying and rotting eternally — and yet eternally alive. For almost a millennium I have suffered unsleepingly the dire anguish of repentance that brings no expiation.”\n\n“Through the powers of saintly and sorcerous vision that never left me, I was doomed to watch the foul deeds, the hell-dark iniquities of Ujuk. Wearing the guise of an abbot, endowed with strange infernal powers together with a kind of immortality, he has presided over Puthuum through the centuries. His enchantments have kept the monastery hidden... save from those that he wishes to draw within reach of his ghoulish hunger, his incubus-like desires. Men he devours; and women are made to serve his lust... And still I am condemned to see his turpitudes; and the seeing is my most grievous punishment.”\n\nThe whisper sank away; and Zobal, who had listened in eldritch awe, as one who hears the speech of a dead man, was doubtful for a moment that Uldor still lived. Then the sere voice went on:\n\n“Archer, I crave a boon from thee; and I offer in return a thing that will aid thee against Ujuk. In thy quiver thou bearest charmed arrows: and the wizardry of him that wrought them was good. Such arrows can slay the else-immortal powers of evil. They can slay Ujuk — and even such evil as endures in me and forbids me to die. Archer, grant me an arrow through the heart: and if that suffice not, an arrow through the right eye, and one through the left. And leave the arrows in their mark, for I deem that thou canst well spare so many. One alone is needed for Ujuk. As to the monks thou hast seen, I will tell thee a secret. They are twelve in number, but...”\n\nZobal would scarcely have believed the thing that Uldor now unfolded, if the events of the day had not left him beyond all incredulity. The abbot continued:\n\n“When I am wholly dead, take thou the talisman which depends about my neck. The talisman is a touchstone that will dissolve such ill enchantments as have a material seeming, if applied thereto with the hand.”\n\nFor the first time, Zobal perceived the talisman, which was an oval of plain gray stone lying upon Uldor’s withered bosom on a chain of black silver.\n\n“Make haste, O archer,” the whispering implored.\n\nZobal had socketed his torch in the pile of moldering bones beside Uldor. With a sense of mingled compulsion and reluctance, he drew an arrow from his quiver, notched it, and aimed unflinchingly down at Uldor’s heart. The shaft went straightly and deeply into its mark; and Zobal waited. But anon from the retracted lips of the black abbot there issued a faint murmuring: “Archer, another arrow!”\n\nAgain the bow was drawn, and a shaft sped unerringly into the hollow orbit of Uldor’s right eye. And again, after an interval, there came the almost inaudible pleading: “Archer, still another shaft.”\n\nOnce more the bow of ironwood sang in the silent vault, and an arrow stood in the left eye of Uldar, quivering with the force of its propulsion. This time there was no whisper from the rotting lips: but Zobal heard a curious rustling, and a sigh as of lapsing sand. Beneath his gaze the black limbs and body crumbled swiftly, the face and head fell in, and the three arrows sagged awry, since there was naught now but a pile of dust and parting bones to hold them embedded.\n\nLeaving the arrows as Uldor had enjoined him to do, Zobal groped for the gray talisman that was now buried amid those fallen relics. Finding it, he hung it carefully at his belt beside the long straight sword which he carried. Perhaps, he reflected, the thing might have its use ere the night was over.\n\nQuickly he turned away and climbed the steps to the courtyard. A saffron-yellow and lopsided moon was soaring above the wall, and he knew by this that he had been absent overlong from his vigil with Cushara. All, however, seemed tranquil: the drowsing animals had not stirred; and the monastery was dark and soundless. Seizing a full wine-skin and a bag containing such edibles as Cushara had asked him to bring, Zobal hurried back to the open hall.\n\nEven as he passed into the building, the arras-like silence before him was burst asunder by a frightful hubbub. He distinguished amid the clamor the screaming of Rubalsa, the screeching of Simban, and the furious roaring of Cushara: but above these, as if to drown them all, an obscene laughter mounted continually, like the welling forth of dark subterrene waters thick and foul with the fats of corruption.\n\nZobal dropped the wine-skin and the sack of comestibles and raced forward, unslinging his bow as he went. The outcries of his companions continued, but he heard them faintly now above the damnable incubus-like laughter that swelled as if to fill the whole monastery. As he neared the space before Rubalsa’s chamber, he saw Cushara beating with the haft of his pike at a blank wall in which there was no longer a hempen-curtained doorway. Behind the wall the screeching of Simban ceased in a gurgling moan like that of some butchered steer; but the girl’s terror-sharpened cries still mounted through the smothering cachinnation.\n\n“This wall was wrought by demons,” raged the pike bearer as he smote vainly at the smooth masonry. “I kept a faithful watch — but they built it behind me in a silence as of the dead. And a fouler work is being done in that chamber.”\n\n“Master thy frenzy,” said Zobal, as he strove to regain the command of his own faculties amid the madness that threatened to overwhelm him. At that instant he recalled the oval gray touchstone of Uldor, which hung at his baldric from its black silver chain; and it came to him that the closed wall was perhaps an unreal enchantment against which the talisman might serve even as Uldor had said.\n\nQuickly he took the touchstone in his fingers and held it to the blank surface where the doorway had been. Cushara looked on with an air of stupefaction, as if deeming the archer demented. But even as the talisman clicked faintly against it, the wall seemed to dissolve, leaving only a rude arras that fell away in tatters as if it too had been no more than a sorcerous illusion. The strange disintegration continued to spread, the whole partition melted away to a few worn blocks, and the gibbous moon shone in as the abbey of Puthuum crumbled silently to a gapped and roofless ruin!\n\nAll this had occurred in a few moments; but the warriors found no room for wonder. By the livid light of the moon, which peered down like the face of a worm-gnawed cadaver, they looked upon a scene so hideous that it caused them to forget all else. Before them, on a cracked floor from whose interstices grew desert grasses, the eunuch Simban lay sprawled in death. His raiment was torn to streamers, and blood bubbled darkly from his mangled throat. Even the leather pouches which he bore at his girdle had been ripped open, and gold coins, vials of medicine and other oddments were scattered around him.\n\nBeyond, by the half-crumbled outer wall, Rubalsa lay in a litter of rotted cloth and woodwork which had been the gorgeously quilted ebon bed. She was trying to fend off with her lifted hands the enormously swollen shape that hung horizontally above her, as if levitated by the floating wing-like folds of its saffron robe. This shape the warriors recognized as the abbot Ujuk.\n\nThe overwelling laughter of the black incubus had ceased, and he turned upon the intruders a face contorted by diabolic lust and fury. His teeth clashed audibly, his eyes glowed in their pouches like beads of red-hot metal, as he withdrew from his position over the girl and loomed monstrously erect before her amid the ruins of the chamber.\n\nCushara rushed forward with leveled pike ere Zobal could fit one of his arrows to the string. But even as the pike-bearer crossed the sill, it seemed that the foully bloated form of Ujuk multiplied itself in a dozen yellow-garmented shapes that surged to meet Cushara’s onset. Appearing as if by some hellish legerdemain, the monks of Puthuum had mustered to assist their abbot.\n\nZobal cried out in warning, but the shapes were all about Cushara, dodging the thrusts of his weapon and clawing ferociously at his plate-armor with their terrific three-inch talons. Valiantly he fought them, only to go down after a little and disappear from sight as if whelmed by a pack of ravening hyenas.\n\nRemembering the scarce credible thing that Uldor had told him, Zobal wasted no arrows upon the monks. His bow ready, he waited for full sight of Ujuk beyond the seething rout that mangled malignantly back and forth above the fallen pike-bearer. In an eddying of the pack he aimed swiftly at the looming incubus, who seemed wholly intent on that fiendish struggle, as if directing it in some wise without spoken word or ponderable gesture. Straight and true the arrow sped with an exultant singing; and good was the sorcery of Amdok, who had wrought it: for Ujuk reeled and went down, his horrid fingers tearing vainly at the shaft that was driven nigh to its fledging of eagle-quills in his body.\n\nNow a strange thing occurred: for, as the incubus fell and writhed to and fro in his dying, the twelve monks all dropped away from Cushara, tossing convulsively on the floor as if they were but shaken shadows of the thing that died. It seemed to Zobal that their forms grew dim and diaphanous, and he saw the cracks in the flagstones beyond them; and their writhings lessened with those of Ujuk; and when Ujuk lay still at last, the faint outlines of the figures vanished as if erased from earth and air. Naught remained but the noisome bulk of that fiend who had been the progeny of the abbot Uldor and the lamia. And the bulk shrank visibly from instant to instant beneath its sagging garments, and a smell of ripe corruption arose, as if all that was human in the hellish thing were rotting swiftly away.\n\nCushara had scrambled to his feet and was peering about in a stunned fashion. His heavy armor had saved him from the talons of his assailants; but the armor itself was scored from greaves to helmet with innumerable scratches.\n\n“Whither have the monks gone?” he inquired. “They were all about me an instant ago, like so many wild dogs worrying a fallen aurochs.”\n\n“The monks were but emanations of Ujuk,” said Zobal. “They were mere fantasms, multiple eidola, that he sent forth and withdrew into himself at will; and they had no real existence apart from him. With Ujuk’s death they had become less than shadows.”\n\n“Verily, such things are prodigious,” opined the pikebearer.\n\nThe warriors now turned their attention to Rubalsa, who had struggled to a sitting posture amid the downfallen wreckage of her bed. The tatters of rotten quilting which she clutched about her with shamefast fingers at their approach, served but little to conceal her well-rounded ivory nakedness. She wore an air of mingled fright and confusion, like a sleeper who has just awakened from some atrocious nightmare.\n\n“Had the incubus harmed thee?” inquired Zobal anxiously. He was reassured by her faint, bewildered negative. Dropping his eyes before the piteous disarray of her girlish beauty, he felt in his heart a deeper enamorment than before, a passion touched with such tenderness as he had never known in the hot, brief loves of his hazard-haunted days. Eyeing Cushara covertly, he knew with dismay that this emotion was shared to the fullest by his comrade.\n\nThe warriors now withdrew to a little distance and turned their backs decorously while Rubalsa dressed.\n\n“I deem,” said Zobal in a low voice beyond overhearing of the girl, “that thou and I tonight have met and conquered such perils as were not contracted for in our service to Hoaraph. And I deem that we are of one mind concerning the maiden, and love her too dearly now to deliver her to the captious lust of a sated king. Therefore we cannot return to Faraad. If it please thee, we shall draw lots for the girl; and the loser will attend the winner as a true comrade till such time as we have made our way from Izdrel, and have crossed the border of some land lying beyond Hoaraph’s rule.”\n\nTo this Cushara agreed. When Rubalsa had finished her dressing, the two began to look about them for such objects as might serve in the proposed sortilege. Cushara would have tossed one of the gold coins, stamped with Hoaraph’s image, which had rolled from Simban’s torn moneybag. But Zobal shook his head at the suggestion, having espied certain items which he thought even more exquisitely appropriate than the coin. These objects were the talons of the incubus, whose corpse had now dwindled in size and was horribly decayed, with a hideous wrinkling of the whole head and an actual shortening of the members. In this process, the claws of hands and feet had all dropped away and were lying loose on the pavement. Removing his helmet, Zobal stooped down and placed with it the five hellish-looking talons of the right hand, among which that of the index finger was the longest.\n\nHe shook the helmet vigorously, as one shakes a dicebox, and there was a sharp clattering from the claws. Then, he held the helmet out to Cushara, saying: “He who draws the forefinger talon shall take the girl.”\n\nCushara put in his hand and withdrew it quickly, holding aloft the heavy thumbnail, which was shortest of all. Zobal drew the nail of the middle finger; and Cushara, at his second trial, brought forth the little finger’s claw. Then, to the deep chagrin of the pike-bearer, Zobal produced the dearly coveted index talon.\n\nRubalsa, who had been watching this singular procedure with open curiosity, now said to the warriors:\n\n“What are ye doing?”\n\nZobal started to explain, but before he had finished, the girl cried out indignantly: “Neither of ye has consulted my preference in this matter.” Then, pouting prettily, she turned away from the disconcerted archer and flung her arms about the neck of Cushara.",

"让葡萄为我们迸发紫焰，让玫瑰色的爱褪去处子之羞：在无名之地的幽暗月轮下，我们屠尽了梦魇与它的孽种。——霍拉夫王弓箭手之歌\n\n弓箭手佐巴尔与长矛手库沙拉曾以约罗斯猩红酒浆与王国敌寇之血，浇铸他们历久弥坚的情谊。在这段粗犷豪迈的友谊中——仅因瓜分酒囊或分配娼妓这类琐事偶生龃龉——他们已为霍拉夫王效命整整十载。蛮荒战事与诡谲险境始终如影随形。勇武之名终令他们蒙受王恩，被遴选入驻守法拉德王宫的精英卫队。如今这对搭档正与宦官辛班同行，穿越那片名为伊兹德尔的锈红色荒原——这片楔形焦土将约罗斯西部生生撕裂。霍拉夫王派遣他们核实游牧民族间流传的传闻：据说在伊兹德尔之外的牧区，有位天仙般的少女出没。辛班腰间钱袋叮当作响，若那少女姿色确如传闻，他便获授权以金币购之。王认为佐巴尔与库沙拉的护卫足以应对不测：毕竟伊兹德尔素以盗匪绝迹著称，事实上根本人迹罕至。但人们传言此地常有驼背巨魔出没，更有美艳蛇妖诱旅人走向诡谲死亡。肥胖的辛班在马鞍上瑟瑟发抖，而两名战士则对宦官与虚无的恶魔大开玩笑。\n\n穿越死寂荒漠后，他们来到沃斯河中游的翠绿牧场。牧族少女鲁芭尔莎与祖母同住河边村落，连宦官都承认此行不虚。库沙拉与佐巴尔瞬间为这位白罂粟般苍白、黑发翻涌铜光的少女倾倒。当辛班与老妪尖声议价时，两名战士谨慎地向少女献着殷勤。\n\n交易达成后，辛班迫不及待要带战利品返回法拉德。黎明前他们便带着睡眼惺忪的鲁芭尔莎悄然离村。正午时分，锈色沙海与铁齿山脊间，这支队伍缓慢前行。青铜板甲的库沙拉骑着覆铜鳞甲的斑纹母马开路，红粗布衣裙的鲁芭尔莎骑着银鞍黑骟马居中，浑身绫罗的辛班骑着灰驴压阵，另一头驮满酒囊的驴子几乎被压垮。轻链甲的佐巴尔执弓殿后，鞍上躁动的公马不停扯动缰绳。他背着宫廷术士阿姆多克用邪术浸泡的箭矢，库沙拉则拒绝使用附魔长矛，声称自己的旧武器足以捅穿任何魔鬼。\n\n鲁芭尔莎突然指向南方地平线——那里有团非云非沙的漆黑正以新月形态急速逼近。转瞬间，黑色雾墙便将他们围困在直径百步的圆圈内，头顶只剩坑底般的惨淡日轮。驴马惊嘶中，辛班在鞍袋间缩成一团：\"早知会撞邪！\"\n\n当二人试图探查雾墙时，战马死活不肯前进。他们下马持械前行，黑雾却突然爆发出战鼓、铙钹、铁蹄交错的喧嚣，仿佛千军万马正在雾中厮杀。撤回马匹旁时，喧嚣又化作无数响尾蛇嘶、凶鸟啼啸。可怖声浪中，鲁芭尔莎的哭喊几不可闻。\n\n黑雾圈开始移动，迫使众人离开小径向北逃窜。西斜的日轮消失后，幽蓝暮色里不时浮现巨型火眼。佐巴尔向这些幻影射出魔箭，每箭都招来恶魔般的狂笑。精疲力竭的鲁芭尔莎垂首马鞍，辛班只剩恐惧的喘息。当队伍蹚过卵石滩时，所有邪音突然退散成遥远絮语。雾墙稀薄处，荒丘在血红暮色中显出狰狞轮廓。\n\n\"我再不敢质疑伊兹德尔的传说了。\"库沙拉阴沉道。佐巴尔望着渐暗的天幕：\"恐怕我们很快连质疑的机会都没有了。\"\n\n\"这又是什么新的邪魔勾当？\"库沙拉低声问道，几乎不敢相信那些地狱般的围攻者已然消失无踪。\n\n\"我也不知，\"弓箭手凝视着暮色回答，\"但眼前这位，恐怕就是魔鬼之一。\"\n\n众人这才注意到，有个裹着斗篷的身影正提着盏半透明兽角制成的灯笼向他们走来。在那身影后方不远处，一座先前无人察觉的方形黑色巨物突然亮起灯光——那显然是栋有着众多窗户的庞大建筑。\n\n随着距离拉近，昏黄油灯映照出来者是个身材魁梧的黑人。他身着某些修道会特有的宽大黄袍，头戴主教的双角紫帽。这确实是个出人意表的怪诞存在：在伊兹德雷尔荒原上若真有修道院，也必是隐秘不为人知的。佐巴尔却突然想起个模糊传说——关于数百年前活跃在约罗斯的一支黑人僧侣团，其修道院遗址早已湮没无闻。如今王国境内的黑人，除了给贵族富商看守闺阁的阉奴外已寥寥无几。\n\n陌生人的接近令驮兽开始躁动不安。\n\n\"汝乃何人？\"库沙拉握紧武器质问道。\n\n黑人咧开血盆大口，露出野犬般的黄黑獠牙。肥腻脸颊堆起的褶皱随着笑容颤动，深陷的斜眼在乌黑眼袋里不停眨动。他夸张地翕张鼻孔，紫黑色厚唇滴着涎水，先用猩红肥舌舔了舔才回答：\"吾乃普苏姆修道院住持乌朱克。\"他的声音浑厚得仿佛从地底传来，\"诸位想必在旅途中误入歧途了，欢迎接受我们的款待。\"\n\n\"确实天黑得突然。\"库沙拉干巴巴地回应。他和佐巴尔都注意到，当乌朱克偷瞄鲁芭尔萨时，那双淫邪眼睛里闪烁的欲念。更令人不适的是他手脚上那些三寸长的弯曲指甲——锋利得如同猛禽的利爪。\n\n鲁芭尔萨和辛班却似乎没注意这些细节，急切接受了住持的邀请。两位战士只得勉强同意，暗中决定盯紧这个乌朱克。\n\n在兽角灯笼引导下，众人来到那座庞然建筑前。沉重的黑木大门无声开启，露出铺着滑腻石板的宽阔庭院。几个体型魁梧的僧侣幽灵般突然现身，他们除黄色头罩外与住持如出一辙，连那诡异的爪状长指甲都分毫不差。这些僧侣无声接过马匹时，库沙拉注意到他们灯笼下竟没有影子。\n\n食堂里青铜古灯散发着盗墓者从沙漠古墓掘出的幽光。乌朱克请客人在乌木长桌前落座后，四名僧侣端来冒着辛香热气的烤肉与深琥珀色酒浆。两位战士拒绝饮食，却发现住持面前根本没有餐具——他正用贪婪目光舔舐着鲁芭尔萨，直到辛班宣称这姑娘是要献给霍阿拉夫国王的。乌朱克闻言竟发出豺狼般的窃笑。\n\n\"我们怕是进了恶魔孵育所，\"佐巴尔耳语道，\"这些家伙连像样的影子都没有。\"库沙拉盯着住持脚下那团畸形的阴影回应：\"比起僧侣，这个住持更让我恶心。\"\n\n当乌朱克提议就寝时，喝了烈酒的鲁芭尔萨已昏昏欲睡。穿过幽暗长廊时，两侧粗麻布帘后的僧房皆漆黑寂静，只有不知源头的阴风搅动着火炬投下狂乱的影子。分配给鲁芭尔萨的房间里有张挂着古式华盖的乌木床，辛班坚持要睡在门口地铺上。\n\n随着住持带领其他人继续前行，整座修道院弥漫着某种陈年尸骨堆积的腐朽气息，仿佛每一块斑驳石砖都在无声诉说着不可名状的恐怖往事。\n\n\"来吧，\"住持说道，狼牙般的齿列在火炬下泛着寒光，\"你们将在备好的床榻上安眠。\"\n\n然而佐巴尔与库沙拉此刻已如卫兵般驻守在鲁芭尔萨闺房门外。他们冷硬地告知尤克，须对霍阿拉夫国王负责守护少女安全，必须寸步不离地值守。\n\n\"愿你们守夜愉快，\"尤克发出鬣狗在墓穴中般的刺耳笑声。\n\n随着他离去，整座建筑仿佛沉入远古死寂般的黑暗。鲁芭尔萨与辛班显然沉睡未动，麻布帷幔后毫无声息。战士们只敢低声交谈，生怕惊扰少女。他们紧握武器警戒着幽暗长廊，对周遭死寂充满怀疑——确信有污秽邪魔潜伏暗处，静候袭击时机。\n\n然而并无异状印证这份不安。穿堂而过的阴风只诉说着被时光遗忘的死亡与轮回的孤寂。二人开始注意到此前忽视的墙垣倾颓痕迹。诡谲妄念如毒蛇般侵入脑海：这座建筑似是废弃千年的废墟；黑衣住持尤克与无影僧众不过是幻影；那驱赶他们来到普瑟姆的黑暗漩涡与地狱之声，仅是正逐渐淡忘的昼魇。\n\n饥渴折磨着他们——自清晨粒米未进，终日仅匆忙啜饮几口酒水。但昏沉睡意仍悄然袭来。他们频频点头惊醒，复又堕入困倦。寂静如同罂粟梦中的塞壬歌声，不断低语所有危险皆成过往幻影。\n\n数小时流逝，东端窗外升起的迟月照亮长廊。院中牲畜突然骚动惊醒较清醒的佐巴尔。马匹嘶鸣渐趋狂乱，驴群随之嚎叫，终将库沙拉也惊醒。\n\n\"务必保持清醒，\"佐巴尔告诫持戟者，\"我去查探骚动根源。\"\n\n\"甚好，\"库沙拉赞同，\"顺带查看粮秣是否完好。带些杏子、芝麻饼与红葡萄酒回来。\"\n\n佐巴尔靴链轻响着穿过空寂长廊。踏入庭院时牲畜骤静。残存火炬微光中，驴马安静如常。他判定或是两匹坐骑短暂争执所致。\n\n正欲取酒水解渴时，一阵阴森低语忽远忽近地缠绕耳际。那声音时而贴面私语，时而沉入地底，却始终萦绕不去，仿佛某个远古罪人永世忏悔的哀泣。\n\n听着这枯朽悲鸣，弓箭手颈毛倒竖，体验到超越战阵的恐惧，却又生出比战友阵亡更深的悲悯。声音乞求着他的救赎，施加着无法抗拒的诡异强制力。虽不解其意，他必须平息这份绝望。\n\n低语起伏间，佐巴尔全然忘却独留库沙拉面对凶险的职责，忘却这声音或是恶魔诱饵。他循声至院角，发现带铁环的斑岩石板。低语突然清晰：\"掀起石板。\"\n\n佐巴尔双手扳动锈环，脊柱几欲碎裂才撬开石板。腐臭尸气喷涌而出，而黑暗中传来尖锐哀求：\"下来。\"\n\n他持唯一燃烧的火炬照见通往墓穴的台阶。决心既下，他踏入两侧堆满骸骨与干尸的凿岩地窖。低语忽止。\n\n\"我在此处。\"沙哑声源自身旁骨堆。火炬照亮一具半腐尸体，枯瘦肢体挂着黄色僧袍残片。当火炬探入壁龛，他看清那戴着腐朽角冠的黑色木乃伊头颅——具显属高大黑人的古尸，却散发着新鲜腐臭。\n\n尸身忽然微动，阴影眼窝中闪过眸光，咧开的嘴唇间再度吐出那可怖低语：\"仔细听。我是普瑟姆住持乌尔多。千年前率众北来建寺，最终独存。后来......\"\n\n随着叙述，佐巴尔得知尤克实为乌尔多与女妖所生孽种。这半人恶魔伪装住持千年，以邪法隐藏寺院，择人而噬。而乌尔多因渎神之罪，承受着永世腐而不死的惩罚。\n\n\"射手，我乞求一箭穿心，\"枯尸低语，\"作为回报，助你对抗尤克。你箭囊里的附魔箭矢......能诛杀这不死邪物。至于你见过的十二僧众......\"\n\n当乌尔多揭露真相时，佐巴尔已无怀疑余地。住持最后道：\"待我彻底死亡，取走颈间护符。这灰石能破除实体幻象。\"\n\n弓箭手这才注意到那挂在黑银链上的椭圆灰石，正静静躺在枯萎的胸膛上。\n\n\"快些，弓箭手。\"那低语声哀求道。\n\n佐巴尔将火把插在乌尔多身旁那堆霉变的骸骨间。怀着矛盾交织的强迫与抗拒，他从箭囊抽出一支箭，搭弦拉弓，毫不犹豫地瞄准乌尔多心脏。箭矢笔直深贯靶心；佐巴尔静候着。但很快，黑袍住持那萎缩的唇间又飘出微弱呢喃：\"射手，再来一箭！\"\n\n铁木弓再度绷紧，第二支箭精准没入乌尔多右眼的空洞眼眶。片刻沉寂后，几乎不可闻的祈求再度响起：\"射手，还要一箭。\"\n\n寂静地窖中第三次响起铁木弓弦的嗡鸣，颤动的箭杆深深扎进乌尔多的左眼。这次腐烂的嘴唇没再发出低语：但佐巴尔听见诡异的窸窣声，以及流沙消逝般的叹息。在他注视下，漆黑的四肢躯干迅速崩解，面部头颅向内塌陷，三支箭矢歪斜垂落——如今只剩一堆尘埃与散骨勉强固定着箭羽。\n\n遵照乌尔多的嘱托留下箭矢，佐巴尔在坍塌的遗骸间摸索那枚灰色护符。他谨慎地将它挂在腰侧，与随身佩戴的笔直长剑并列。或许，他思忖着，在天亮前这件物品真能派上用场。\n\n他迅速转身攀上庭院台阶。一弯橘黄残月正悬在墙头，这提醒他已离开库沙拉值守处太久。然而四下静谧：打盹的牲畜未曾骚动；修道院沉浸在黑暗与寂静中。抓起装满的酒囊和库沙拉嘱托的食物袋，佐巴尔匆匆返回大厅。\n\n刚踏入建筑，帷幔般的寂静便被可怖喧嚣撕裂。在嘈杂中他辨出鲁巴尔萨的尖叫、辛班的厉嚎与库沙拉的怒吼：但压倒这一切的，是持续升腾的污秽笑声，如同涌出地底的腐臭浊流，裹挟着溃烂的油脂。\n\n佐巴尔扔下酒囊食物袋，边冲刺边解下长弓。同伴的呼号仍在继续，但在充溢整座修道院的恶魔般笑声中显得微弱。接近鲁巴尔萨房前空地时，他看见库沙拉正用长矛柄猛击光秃秃的墙面——原本挂着麻布帘的门洞已然消失。墙后辛班的尖嚎化作被宰公牛般的咕哝；而少女的惊叫仍穿透窒息的笑声。\n\n\"这墙是恶魔所筑。\"长矛手徒劳击打平整石壁怒吼，\"我明明严加看守——它们却如死寂般在我身后砌起。更肮脏的勾当正在那房间里上演。\"\n\n\"控制你的狂乱。\"佐巴尔在逼近的疯狂中竭力保持理智说道。此刻他想起悬挂在银链上的乌尔多护符，或许正如黑袍修士所言，这面闭锁的墙只是虚幻魔法。\n\n他迅速取出灰色椭圆护符按在原本是门洞的墙面上。库沙拉呆望着，仿佛认为弓箭手已然癫狂。但当护符轻触墙壁的刹那，石壁如幻影般消融，只剩破碎帷幔飘落。诡异的崩解持续蔓延，整面隔墙化作零星碎块，随着普瑟姆修道院无声坍塌为断垣残壁，凸月将腐尸般惨白的光倾泻而入！\n\n这一切转瞬发生，战士们无暇惊诧。在蛆虫啃噬的尸首般月色下，他们目睹了令万物失色的可怖场景。龟裂地板上，阉人辛班陈尸于荒漠杂草间。衣衫碎成条缕，碎裂喉管汩汩冒着黑血。连腰带皮囊都被撕开，金币、药瓶与杂物散落四周。\n\n外侧半塌的墙边，鲁巴尔萨躺在曾是乌木雕花大床的朽木破布堆中。她高举双手试图阻挡悬浮上方的臃肿形体——那被黄袍翼褶托起的怪物正是住持乌朱克。\n\n黑色梦魇的笑声戛然而止。恶魔转向闯入者，扭曲面容交织着淫欲与暴怒。当它从少女上方抽身，在房间废墟中骇然直立时，利齿碰撞声清晰可闻，眼窝里闪烁着熔铁般的红光。\n\n未等佐巴尔搭箭，库沙拉已平举长矛冲去。但就在矛手跨过门槛瞬间，乌朱克肿胀的身形竟分裂成十二个黄袍幻影扑来。普瑟姆的僧侣们如地狱戏法般现身助阵。\n\n佐巴尔高声警告，但幻影已包围库沙拉，躲闪矛刺并用三寸利爪撕扯板甲。勇猛的矛手终被压倒，仿佛遭鬣狗群撕咬般消失在黄潮中。\n\n想起乌尔多难以置信的告诫，佐巴尔未对僧侣浪费箭矢。他引弓等待，终于在翻腾的怪物间隙瞄准专心操纵战局的乌朱克。箭矢带着欢鸣精准命中，阿姆多克的附魔显效了：乌朱克踉跄倒地，徒劳抓挠深贯躯干的箭羽。\n\n异变突生：当梦魇垂死抽搐时，十二僧侣同时从库沙拉身上跌落，如将熄阴影般在地板上痉挛。佐巴尔目睹它们随乌朱克衰弱的形体逐渐透明，最终随恶魔的静止而消散。唯有住持乌尔多与女妖杂交的秽恶残躯在袍服下急速萎缩，散发出浓烈的腐臭。\n\n库沙拉摇晃站起，板甲上布满爪痕。\"僧侣去哪了？\"他茫然四顾，\"方才还像狼群撕扯野牛般围着我。\"\n\n\"那些不过是乌朱克的分身。\"佐巴尔解释，\"随本体死亡而湮灭的幻影。\"\n\n矛手惊叹：\"此等异事闻所未闻。\"\n\n战士们转向挣扎坐起的鲁巴尔萨。她羞怯地抓着破被单遮掩象牙般的胴体，恍如刚从噩梦中惊醒的睡客。\n\n\"那恶魔可曾伤你？\"佐巴尔急切询问。少女迷茫的否定让他稍安。瞥见同伴同样炽热的目光，他意识到两人已深陷情网。\n\n他们背过身让少女更衣。佐巴尔低语：\"今夜我们遭遇的凶险已超出与霍拉夫的契约。若你同意，我们抽签决定谁带她远走高飞。\"\n\n库沙拉应允。他们用梦魇脱落的利爪代替金币——最长的那根食指爪将决定少女归属。当佐巴尔抽出那根梦寐以求的爪甲时，矛手难掩沮丧。\n\n全程好奇观望的鲁巴尔萨此时对战士们开口：\n\n\"你们在做什么？\"\n\n佐巴尔刚要解释，话音未落，那少女便愤然叫道：\"你们谁都没问过我的意思。\"她娇嗔地撅起嘴，转身避开窘迫的弓箭手，突然张开双臂搂住了库沙拉的后颈。"

        "title": "The Death of Ilalotha",
        "content": "\n\nBlack Lord of bale and fear, master of all confusion! By thee, thy prophet saith, New power is given to wizards after death, And witches in corruption draw forbidden breath And weave such wild enchantment and illusion As none but lamiae may use; And through thy grace the charneled corpses lose Their horror, and nefandous loves are lighted In noisome vaults long nighted; And vampires make their sacrifice to thee — Disgorging blood as if great urns had poured Their bright vermilion hoard About the washed and weltering sarcophagi.\n\n-- Ludar's Litany to Thasaidon.\n\nAccording to the custom in old Tasuun, the obsequies of Ilalotha, lady-in-waiting to the self-widowed Queen Xantlicha, had formed an occasion of much merrymaking and prolonged festivity. For three days, on a bier of diverse-colored silks from the Orient, under a rose-hued canopy that might well have domed some nuptial couch, she had lain clad with gala garments amid the great feasting-hall of the royal palace in Miraab. About her, from morning dusk to sunset, from cool even to torridly glaring dawn, the feverish tide of the funeral orgies had surged and eddied without slackening. Nobles, court officials, guardsmen, scullions, astrologers, eunuchs, and all the high ladies, waiting-women and female slaves of Xantlicha, had taken part in that prodigal debauchery which was believed to honour most fitly the deceased. Mad songs and obscene ditties were sung, and dancers whirled in vertiginous frenzy to the lascivious pleading of untirable lutes. Wines and liquors were poured torrentially from monstrous amphorae; the tables fumed with spicy meats piled in huge hummocks and forever replenished. The drinkers offered libation to Ilalotha, till the fabrics of her bier were stained to darker hues by the spilt vintages. On all sides around her, in attitudes of disorder or prone abandonment, lay those who had yielded to amorous license of the fullness of their potations. With halfshut eyes and lips slightly parted, in the rosy shadow cast by the catafalque, she wore no aspect of death but seemed a sleeping empress who ruled impartially over the living and the dead. This appearance, together with a strange heightening of her natural beauty, was remarked by many: and some said that she seemed to await a lover's kiss rather than the kisses of the worm.\n\nOn the third evening, when the many-tongued brazen lamps were lit and the rites drew to their end, there returned to court the Lord Thulos, acknowledged lover of Queen Xantlicha, who had gone a week previous to visit his domain on the western border and had heard nothing of Ilalotha's death. Still unaware, he came into the hall at that hour when the saturnalia began to flag and the fallen revelers to outnumber those who still moved and drank and made riot.\n\nHe viewed the disordered hall with little surprise, for such scenes were familiar to him from childhood. Then, approaching the bier, he recognized its occupant with a certain startlement. Among the numerous ladies of Miraab who had drawn his libertine affections, Ilalotha had held sway longer than most; and, it was said, she had grieved more passionately over his defection than any other. She had been superseded a month before by Xantlicha, who had shown favor to Thulos in no ambiguous manner; and Thulos, perhaps, had abandoned her not without regret: for the role of lover to the queen, though advantageous and not wholly disagreeable, was somewhat precarious. Xantlicha, it was universally believed, had rid herself of the late King Archain by means of a tomb-discovered vial of poison that owed its peculiar subtlety and virulence to the art of ancient sorcerers. Following this act of disposal, she had taken many lovers, and those who failed to please her came invariably to ends no less violent than that of Archain. She was exigent, exorbitant, demanding a strict fidelity somewhat irksome to Thulos; who, pleading urgent affairs on his remote estate, had been glad enough of a week away from court.\n\nNow, as he stood beside the dead woman, Thulos forgot the queen and bethought him of certain summer nights that had been honeyed by the fragrance of jasmine and the jasmine-white beauty of Ilalotha. Even less than the others could he believe her dead: for her present aspect differed in no wise from that which she had often assumed during their old intercourse. To please his whim, she had feigned the inertness and complaisance of slumber or death; and at such times he had loved her with an ardor undismayed by the pantherine vehemence with which, at other whiles, she was wont to reciprocate or invite his caresses.\n\nMoment by moment, as if through the working of some powerful necromancy, there grew upon him a curious hallucination, and it seemed that he was again the lover of those lost nights, and had entered that bower in the palace gardens where Ilalotha waited him on a couch strewn with overblown petals, lying with bosom quiet as her face and hands. No longer was he aware of the crowded hall: the high-flaring lights, the wine-flushed faces, had become a moonbright parterre of drowsily nodding blossoms, and the voices of the courtiers were no more than a faint suspiration of wind amid cypress and jasmine. The warm, aphrodisiac perfumes of the June night welled about him; and again, as of old, it seemed that they arose from the person of Ilalotha no less than from the flowers. Prompted by intense desire, he stooped over and felt her cool arm stir involuntarily beneath his kiss.\n\nThen, with the bewilderment of a sleep-walker awakened rudely, he heard a voice that hissed in his ear with soft venom: \"Hast forgotten thyself, my Lord Thulos? Indeed I wonder little, for many of my bawcocks deem that she is fairer in death than in life.\" And, turning from Ilalotha, while the weird spell dissolved from his senses, he found Xantlicha at his side. Her garments were disarrayed, her hair was unbound and disheveled, and she reeled slightly, clutching him by the shoulder with sharp-nailed fingers. Her full, poppy-crimson lips were curled by a vixenish fury, and in her long-lidded yellow eyes there blazed the jealousy of an amorous cat.\n\nThulos, overwhelmed by a strange confusion, remembered but partially the enchantment to which he had succumbed; and he was unsure whether or not he had actually kissed Ilalotha and had felt her flesh quiver to his mouth. Verily, he thought, this thing could not have been, and a waking dream had momentarily seized him. But he was troubled by the words of Xantlicha and her anger, and by the half-furtive drunken laughters and ribald whispers that he heard passing among the people about the hall.\n\n\"Beware, my Thulos,\" the queen murmured, her strange anger seeming to subside; \"For men say that she was a witch.\"\n\n\"How did she die? \" queried Thulos.\n\n\"From no other fever than that of love, it is rumored.\"\n\n\"Then, surely, she was no witch,\" Thulos argued with a lightness that was far from his thoughts and feelings; \"for true sorcery should have found the cure.\"\n\n\"It was from love of thee,\" said Xantlicha darkly; \"and as all women know, thy heart is blacker and harder than black adamant. No witchcraft, however potent, could prevail thereon.\" Her mood, as she spoke, appeared to soften suddenly. \"Thy absence has been long, my lord. Come to me at midnight: I will wait for thee in the south pavilion.\"\n\nThen, eyeing him sultrily for an instant from under drooped lids, and pinching his arm in such a manner that her nails pierced through cloth and skin like a cat's talons, she turned from Thulos to hail certain of the harem-eunuchs.\n\nThulos, when the queen's attention was disengaged from him, ventured to look again at Ilalotha; pondering, meanwhile, the curious remarks of Xantlicha. He knew that Ilalotha, like many of the court-ladies, had dabbled in spells and philtres; but her witchcraft had never concerned him, since he felt no interest in other charms or enchantments than those with which nature had endowed the bodies of women. And it was quite impossible for him to believe that Ilalotha had died from a fatal passion: since, in his experience, passion was never fatal.\n\nIndeed, as he regarded her with confused emotions, he was again beset by the impression that she had not died at all. There was no repetition of the weird, half-remembered hallucination of other time and place; but it seemed to him that she had stirred from her former position on the wine stained bier, turning her face toward him a little, as a woman turns to an expected lover; that the arm he had kissed (either in dream or reality) was outstretched a little farther from her side.\n\nThulos bent nearer, fascinated by the mystery and drawn by a stranger attraction that he could not have named. Again, surely, he had dreamt or had been mistaken. But even as the doubt grew, it seemed that the bosom of Ilalotha stirred in faint respiration, and he heard an almost inaudible but thrilling whisper: \"Come to me at midnight. I will wait for thee... in the tomb.\"\n\nAt this instant there appeared beside the catafalque certain people in the sober and rusty raiment of sextons, who had entered the hall silently, unperceived by Thulos or by any of the company. They carried among them a thin-walled sarcophagus of newly welded and burnished bronze. It was their office to remove the dead woman and bear her to the sepulchral vaults of her family, which were situated in the old necropolis lying somewhat to northward of the palace-gardens.\n\nThulos would have cried out to restrain them from their purpose; but his tongue clove tightly; nor could he move any of his members. Not knowing whether he slept or woke, he watched the people of the cemetery as they placed Ilalotha in the sarcophagus and bore her quickly from the hall, unfollowed and still unheeded by the drowsy bacchanalians. Only when the somber cortège had departed was he able to stir from his position by the empty bier. His thoughts were sluggish, and full of darkness and indecision. Smitten by an immense fatigue that was not unnatural after his day-long journey, he withdrew to his apartments and fell instantly into death-deep slumber.\n\nFreeing itself gradually from the cypress-boughs, as if from the long, stretched fingers of witches, a waning and misshapen moon glared horizontally through the eastern window when Thulos awoke. By this token, he knew that the hour drew toward midnight, and recalled the assignation which Queen Xantlicha had made with him: an assignation which he could hardly break without incurring the queen's deadly displeasure. Also, with singular clearness, he recalled another rendezvous... at the same time but in a different place. Those incidents and impressions of Ilalotha's funeral, which, at the time, had seemed so dubitable and dream-like, returned to him with a profound conviction of reality, as if etched on his mind by some mordant chemistry of sleep... or the strengthening of some sorcerous charm. He felt that Ilalotha had indeed stirred on her bier and spoken to him; that the sextons had borne her still living to the tomb. Perhaps her supposed demise had been merely a sort of catalepsy; or else she had deliberately feigned death in a last effort to revive his passion. These thoughts awoke within him a raging fever of curiosity and desire; and he saw before him her pale, inert, luxurious beauty, presented as if by enchantment.\n\nDirely distraught, he went down by the lampless stairs and hallways to the moonlit labyrinth of the gardens. He cursed the untimely exigence of Xantlicha. However, as he told himself, it was more than likely that the queen, continuing to imbibe the liquors of Tasuun, had long since reached a condition in which she would neither keep nor recall her appointment. This thought reassured him: in his queerly bemused mind, it soon became a certainty; and he did not hasten toward the south pavilion but strolled vaguely amid the wan and somber boscage.\n\nMore and more it seemed unlikely that any but himself was abroad: for the long, unlit wings of the palace sprawled as in vacant stupor; and in the gardens there were only dead shadows, and pools of still fragrance in which the winds had drowned. And over all, like a pale, monstrous poppy, the moon distilled her death-white slumber. Thulos, no longer mindful of his rendezvous with Xantlicha, yielded without further reluctance to the urgence that drove him toward another goal... Truly, it was no less than obligatory that he should visit the vaults and learn whether or not he had been deceived in his belief concerning Ilalotha. Perhaps, if he did not go, she would stifle in the shut sarcophagus, and her pretended death would quickly become an actuality. Again, as if spoken in the moonlight before him, he heard the words she had whispered, or seemed to whisper, from the bier: \"Come to me at midnight... I will wait for thee... in the tomb.\"\n\nWith the quickening steps and pulses of one who fares to the warm, petal-sweet couch of an adored mistress, he left the palace-grounds by an unguarded northern postern and crossed the weedy common between the royal gardens and the old cemetery. Unchilled and undismayed, he entered those always-open portals of death, where ghoul-headed monsters of black marble, glaring with hideously pitted eyes, maintained their charnel postures before the crumbling pylons.\n\nThe very stillness of the low-bosomed graves, the rigor and pallor of the tall shafts, the deepness of bedded cypress shadows, the inviolacy of death by which all things were invested, served to heighten the singular excitement that had fired Thulos' blood. It was as if he had drunk a philtre spiced with mummia. All around him the mortuary silence seemed to burn and quiver with a thousand memories of Ilalotha, together with those expectations to which he had given as yet no formal image....\n\nOnce, with Ilalotha, he had visited the subterranean tomb of her ancestors; and, recalling its situation clearly, he came without indirection to the low-arched and cedar-darkened entrance. Rank nettles and fetid fumitories, growing thickly about the seldom-used adit, were crushed down by the tread of those who had entered there before Thulos; and the rusty, iron-wrought door sagged heavily inward on its loose hinges. At his feet there lay an extinguished flambeau, dropped, no doubt, by one of the departing sextons. Seeing it, he realized that he had brought with him neither candle nor lantern for the exploration of the vaults, and found in that providential torch an auspicious omen.\n\nBearing the lit flambeau, he began his investigation. He gave no heed to the piled and dusty sarcophagi in the first reaches of the subterrane: for, during their past visit, Ilalotha had shown to him a niche at the innermost extreme, where, in due time, she herself would find sepulture among the members of that decaying line. Strangely, insidiously, like the breath of some vernal garden, the languid and luscious odor of jasmine swam to meet him through the musty air, amid the tiered presence of the dead; and it drew him to the sarcophagus that stood open between others tightly lidded. There he beheld Ilalotha lying in the gay garments of her funeral, with half-shut eyes and half- parted lips; and upon her was the same weird and radiant beauty, the same voluptuous pallor and stillness, that had drawn Thulos with a necromantic charm.\n\n\"I knew that thou wouldst come, O Thulos,\" she murmured, stirring a little, as if involuntarily, beneath the deepening ardor of his kisses that passed quickly from throat to bosom...\n\nThe torch that had fallen from Thulos' hand expired in the thick dust...\n\nXantlicha, retiring to her chamber betimes, had slept illy. Perhaps she had drunk too much or too little of the dark, ardent vintages; perhaps her blood was fevered by the return of Thulos, and her jealousy still troubled by the hot kiss which he had laid on Ilalotha's arm during the obsequies. A restlessness was upon her; and she rose well before the hour of her meeting with Thulos, and stood at her chamber window seeking such coolness as the night air might afford.\n\nThe air, however, seemed heated as by the burning of hidden furnaces; her heart appeared to swell in her bosom and stifle her; and her unrest and agitation were increased rather than diminished by the spectacle of the moon-lulled gardens. She would have hurried forth to the tryst in the pavilion; but, despite her impatience, she thought it well to keep Thulos waiting. Leaning thus from her sill, she beheld Thulos when he passed amid the parterres and arbors below. She was struck by the unusual haste and intentness of his steps, and she wondered at their direction, which could bring him only to places remote from the rendezvous she had named. He disappeared from her sight in the cypress-lined alley that led to the north garden-gate; and her wonderment was soon mingled with alarm and anger when he did not return.\n\nIt was incomprehensible to Xantlicha that Thulos, or any man, would dare to forget the tryst in his normal senses; and seeking an explanation, she surmised that the working of some baleful and potent sorcery was probably involved. Nor, in the light of certain incidents that she had observed, and much else that had been rumored, was it hard for her to identify the possible sorceress. Ilalotha, the queen knew, had loved Thulos to the point of frenzy, and had grieved inconsolably after his desertion of her. People said that she had wrought various ineffectual spells to bring him back; that she had vainly invoked demons and sacrificed to them, and had made futile invultuations and death-charms against Xantlicha. In the end, she had died of sheer chagrin and despair, or perhaps had slain herself with some undetected poison... But, as was commonly believed in Tasuun, a witch dying thus, with unslaked desires and frustrate cantrips, could turn herself into a lamia vampire and procure thereby the consummation of all her sorceries...\n\nThe queen shuddered, remembering these things; and remembering also the hideous and malign transformation that was said to accompany the achievement of such ends: for those who used in this manner the power of hell must take on the very character and the actual semblance of infernal beings. Too well she surmised the destination of Thulos, and the danger to which he had gone forth if her suspicions were true. And, knowing that she might face an equal danger, Xantlicha determined to follow him.\n\nShe made little preparation, for there was no time to waste; but took from beneath her silken bed-cushion a small, straight-bladed dagger that she kept always within reach. The dagger had been anointed from point to hilt with such venom as was believed efficacious against either the living or the dead. Bearing it in her right hand, and carrying in the other a slot-eyed lantern that she might require later, Xantlicha stole swiftly from the palace.\n\nThe last lees of the evening's wine ebbed wholly from her brain, and dim, ghastly fears awoke, warning her like the voices of ancestral phantoms. But, firm in her determination, she followed the path taken by Thulos; the path taken earlier by those sextons who had borne Ilalotha to her place of sepulture. Hovering from tree to tree, the moon accompanied her like a worm-hollowed visage. The soft, quick patter of her cothurns, breaking the white silence, seemed to tear the filmy cobweb pall that withheld from her a world of spectral abominations. And more and more she recalled, of those legendries that concerned such beings as Ilalotha; and her heart was shaken within her: for she knew that she would meet no mortal woman but a thing raised up and inspirited by the seventh hell. But amid the chill of these horrors, the thought of Thulos in the lamia's arms was like a red brand that seared her bosom.\n\nNow the necropolis yawned before Xantlicha, and her path entered the cavernous gloom of far-vaulted funereal trees, as if passing into monstrous and shadowy mouths that were tusked with white monuments. The air grew dank and noisome, as if filled with the breathing of open crypts. Here the queen faltered, for it seemed that black, unseen cacodemons rose all about her from the graveyard ground, towering higher than the shafts and boles, and standing in readiness to assail her if she went farther. Nevertheless, she came anon to the dark adit that she sought. Tremulously she lit the wick of the dot-eyed lantern; and, piercing the gross underground darkness before her with its bladed beam, she passed with ill-subdued terror and repugnance into that abode of the dead... and perchance of the Undead.\n\nHowever, as she followed the first turnings of the catacomb, it seemed that she was to encounter nothing more abhorrent than charnel mold and century-sifted dust; nothing more formidable than the serried sarcophagi that lined the deeply hewn shelves of stone; sarcophagi that had stood silent and undisturbed ever since the time of their deposition. Here, surely the slumber of all the dead was unbroken, and the nullity of death was inviolate.\n\nAlmost the queen doubted that Thulos had preceded her there; till, turning her light on the ground, she discerned the print of his poulaines, long-tipped and slender in the deep dust amid those foot-marks left by the rudely shod sextons. And she saw that the footprints of Thulos pointed only in one direction, while those of the others plainly went and returned.\n\nThen, at an undetermined distance in the shadows ahead, Xantlicha heard a sound in which the sick moaning of some amorous woman was bent with a snarling as of jackals over their meat. Her blood returned frozen upon her heart as she went onward step by slow step, clutching her dagger in a hand drawn sharply back, and holding the light high in advance. The sound grew louder and most distinct; and there came to her now a perfume as of flowers in some warm June night; but, as she still advanced, the perfume was mixed with more and more of a smothering foulness such as she had never heretofore known, and was touched with the reeking of blood.\n\nA few paces more, and Xantlicha stood as if a demon's arm had arrested her: for her lantern's light had found the inverted face and upper body of Thulos, hanging from the end of a burnished, new-wrought sarcophagus that occupied a scant interval between others green with rust. One of Thulos' hands clutched rigidly the rim of the sarcophagus, while the other hand, moving feebly, seemed to caress a dim shape that leaned above him with arms showing jasmine-white in the narrow beam, and dark fingers plunging into his bosom. His head and body seemed but an empty hull, and his hand hung skeleton-thin on the bronze rim, and his whole aspect was vein-drawn, as if he had lost more blood than was evident on his torn throat and face, and in his sodden raiment and dripping hair.\n\nFrom the thing stooping above Thulos, there came ceaselessly that sound which was half moan and half snarl. And as Xantlicha stood in petrific fear and loathing, she seemed to hear from Thulos' lips an indistinct murmur, more of ecstasy than pain. The murmur ceased, and his head hung slacklier than before, so that the queen deemed him verily dead. At this she found such wrathful courage as enabled her to step nearer and raise the lantern higher: for, even amid her extreme panic, it came to her that by means of the wizard-poisoned dagger she might still haply slay the thing that had slain Thulos.\n\nWaveringly the light crept aloft, disclosing inch by inch that infamy which Thulos had caressed in the darkness...\n\nIt crept even to the crimson-smeared wattles, and the fanged and ruddled orifice that was half mouth and half beak... till Xantlicha knew why the body of Thulos was a mere shrunken hull... In what the queen saw, there remained nothing of Ilalotha except the white, voluptuous arms, and a vague outline of human breasts melting momently into breasts that were not human, like clay molded by a demon sculptor. The arms too began to change and darken; and, as they changed, the dying hand of Thulos stirred again and fumbled with a caressing movement toward the horror. And the thing seemed to heed him not but withdrew its fingers from his bosom, and reached across him with members stretching enormously, as if to claw the queen or fondle her with its dribbling talons.\n\nIt was then that Xantlicha let fall the lantern and the dagger, and ran with shrill, endless shriekings and laughters of immitigable madness from the vault.",
        "content_cn": "恐怖与灾厄的黑色主宰，万般混乱的统治者！汝之先知宣称，亡故后的巫师将获新力，腐朽中的女巫得以汲取禁忌气息，编织唯有吸血妖妇方能施展的狂野魅惑；因汝恩典，墓穴陈尸褪去可怖形貌，污秽爱欲在恶臭地窖中燃起幽光；吸血鬼亦向汝献祭——倾泻鲜血恍若巨瓮倾覆，将猩红宝液泼洒于浸透的尸棺周遭。\n\n——卢达尔《致萨赛顿的连祷》\n\n依照古塔苏恩习俗，自寡女王赞特莉夏的侍女伊拉洛萨的葬礼，已成为一场纵情狂欢的延续盛典。整整三日，她身着华服静卧于米拉阿布王宫盛宴厅内，身下是东方异彩丝绸铺就的灵床，头顶玫瑰色华盖宛若婚榻穹顶。从晨昏至日落，自凉夜到灼昼，葬礼狂欢的炽浪在她周围翻涌不息。贵族、廷臣、卫兵、仆役、占星师、宦官，连同赞特莉夏麾下所有贵妇、侍女与女奴，皆沉浸于这场被认为最配得上逝者的奢靡放荡之中。癫狂歌谣与淫词艳曲回荡不绝，舞者在不知疲倦的鲁特琴撩拨下旋入晕眩的狂态。酒液如洪流从巨瓮倾泻，餐桌上香料蒸腾的肉山永不枯竭。饮者向伊拉洛萨祭酒，直至泼洒的美酒将灵床织物染作暗色。她四周横陈着因纵欲与酣醉而颓倒的躯体。在灵柩投下的玫瑰色阴影中，她半阖双眸、唇瓣微启，毫无死态，反似一位统御生死两界的沉睡女皇。这般容姿与其异常焕发的艳色令众人称奇，更有人私语她仿佛在等待情人之吻，而非蛆虫的啃噬。\n\n第三日黄昏，当多舌铜灯燃起、仪式临近终章时，女王公开的情人图洛斯勋爵归返宫廷。他此前赴西部领地巡视一周，对伊拉洛萨之死毫不知情。踏入大厅时，他只见酒神祭宴渐趋萎靡，醉倒的狂欢者已多于尚能纵饮喧哗之人。\n\n这混乱场景于他毫不陌生。待走近灵床认出逝者时，他却猛然一怔。在米拉阿布众多曾俘获他浪子之心的贵妇中，伊拉洛萨的统治最为长久。据说她为他的背离所流的泪亦最为炽烈。一月前，当赞特莉夏以毫不含糊的姿态垂青于他时，伊拉洛萨便被取代。或许图洛斯并非毫无遗憾：尽管成为女王情夫有利可图且非全然不快，却总如履薄冰。世人皆信赞特莉夏借古巫师秘制的剧毒小瓶除掉了先王阿尔凯恩。此后她纳宠无数，而令她不悦者皆步阿尔凯恩后尘。她苛求专一，这令图洛斯颇感束缚——正因如此，他借口领地急务离开宫廷一周，反倒如释重负。\n\n此刻立于亡者身旁，图洛斯忘却女王，只忆起那些被茉莉芬芳与伊拉洛萨茉莉般皎洁的胴体所沁透的夏夜。他比旁人更难以信其死亡：因她此刻神态与往昔欢好时佯装沉睡或死亡的柔顺模样毫无二致。为遂他心意，她常故作死寂，而此刻他再度为这份静美倾倒——正如昔日他总痴迷于她时而如黑豹般激烈回应爱抚的野性。\n\n恍若强大死灵术的蛊惑，奇异的幻觉在他心头滋长。他渐觉重返那些逝去的良宵，步入宫苑凉亭——伊拉洛萨正卧于凋瓣铺就的软榻，胸脯如面容与双手般静美。周遭喧嚣尽化月下困倦摇曳的花丛，廷臣絮语成了柏树与茉莉间的微风。六月的催情芬芳包围着他，仿佛仍从她肌肤渗出。在炽欲驱使下，他俯身亲吻，竟觉她冰凉手臂在他唇下微颤。\n\n如梦游者被粗暴惊醒，他耳畔突然响起毒蛇般的低语：\"图洛斯勋爵莫非忘了身份？也难怪——我的雄鸡们都说她死时比生前更美呢。\"幻象消散，他转身见赞特莉夏正揪住他肩膀。她衣冠不整，发丝散乱，指甲深陷他皮肉。猩红唇瓣扭曲如暴怒雌狐，狭长黄眼里燃着情欲母猫的妒火。\n\n图洛斯昏惑难辨，只依稀记得方才的魅惑。他不确定是否真吻过伊拉洛萨，抑或只是幻梦。但女王的怒言与厅内窃窃私语令他不安。\n\n\"当心啊，我的图洛斯，\"女王怒意稍敛，\"人们说她是个女巫。\"\n\n\"她怎么死的？\"\n\n\"传闻是害了相思热病。\"\n\n\"那必非女巫，\"图洛斯强作轻松，\"真通巫术者当能自医。\"\n\n\"她正是为你害的相思，\"赞特莉夏阴沉道，\"天下女子皆知，你的心比黑金刚石更硬更冷。再强的巫术也奈何不得。\"她语气忽转柔媚：\"你离开太久了。子夜来南亭寻我。\"\n\n她垂睫投来湿热一瞥，指甲如猫爪刺入他臂膀，旋即转身召唤宦官。\n\n待女王走远，图洛斯再度端详伊拉洛萨，琢磨那些怪话。他知伊拉洛萨如许多贵妇般研习过咒术，但向来只对女性天然魅力感兴趣。至于伊拉洛萨会为情而死——以他经验，情欲从不致命。\n\n凝视间，他竟又觉她未曾死去。虽未重现方才的幻境，却分明见她已在酒渍斑斑的灵床上转面朝他，如待情郎般微伸被他吻过的手臂。\n\n图洛斯鬼使神差地俯身，忽见她胸脯似在微微起伏，耳畔飘来细若游丝却令他战栗的絮语：\"子夜来寻我...我在墓中等你...\"\n\n此时数名身着锈色寿衣的守墓人悄然而至，抬着新铸的青铜棺椁。他们要将她送往宫苑北侧古坟场的家族墓穴。图洛斯欲阻无言，如堕梦魇般僵立，目送他们迅速抬走棺木。待阴森行列消失，他才从空灵床旁踉跄退开。昏沉思绪中，他拖着跋涉整日的疲惫身躯回到寝宫，顷刻堕入死般沉睡。\n\n残月如畸形的苍白罂粟，自柏枝间探出枯爪般的幽光，将图洛斯惊醒。他知子夜将至，想起与女王的密约——失约必招致杀身之祸。但另一场幽会同样清晰地浮现脑海。葬礼上那些似梦非梦的片段，此刻如被梦的蚀刻或巫术强化般历历在目。他确信伊拉洛萨确曾低语，守墓人确将活生生的她葬入墓穴。或许她的\"死亡\"只是僵厥症，或是为唤回他爱欲的最后一搏。这念头点燃他血液中的好奇与渴望，她苍白慵懒的艳姿如咒术般浮现在眼前。\n\n他魂不守舍地摸黑穿过宫苑。月光下，宫殿翼楼如僵死的巨兽匍匐，园中唯有凝固的暗影与沉溺香气的死潭。残月倾泻着尸白色的睡意。图洛斯不再思及女王，任由那股冲动将他推向坟场——他必须确认伊拉洛萨的真相。若不去，她或将在密闭棺中窒息，假死成真。那缕絮语再度响起：\"子夜来寻我...我在墓中等你...\"\n\n他如赴情人香闺般疾行，穿过无人看守的北门，踏入坟场。黑大理石雕的食尸鬼拱卫着倾颓的墓门，眼窝中的幽光森然可怖。坟茔的静默、碑林的惨白、柏影的深邃，皆令他血液沸腾，恍若饮下掺了木乃伊粉的春药。死亡的圣洁中，无数关于伊拉洛萨的记忆与期待在寂静中灼烧...\n\n他曾随她造访其家族地下墓室。循着记忆，他找到被雪松阴影笼罩的低矮拱门。荆棘与臭草间留有新鲜踩踏痕迹，锈蚀的铁门虚掩着。一支熄灭的火把躺在地上——定是守墓人所遗。他庆幸天赐照明，视之为吉兆。\n\n举着火把深入墓穴，他无视前厅积尘的棺椁，直奔最内侧壁龛——伊拉洛萨曾指给他看自己日后长眠之处。陈腐空气中，一缕茉莉幽香如春日花园的吐息般缠上他，引他走向一具未封盖的棺椁。伊拉洛萨静卧其中，华服未改，半阖的眼睑与微启的唇瓣依旧，周身笼罩着令他痴迷的妖异美艳。\n\n\"我知你会来，图洛斯。\"她轻喃道。当他炽热的吻从她玉颈滑向胸脯时，她的躯体似有无意识的微颤...\n\n火把从他指间跌落，在厚尘中熄灭...\n\n赞特莉夏早早回房，却辗转难眠。或许是塔苏恩烈酒饮得过多或过少，又或许因图洛斯归来而血热，更因他在葬礼上亲吻伊拉洛萨手臂的场面灼烧着她的妒火。她躁动难安，未及约定时分便起身伫立窗前，企盼夜风带来些许凉意。\n\n然而，空气中仿佛有隐藏熔炉在燃烧般燥热；她的心脏在胸腔中肿胀到窒息；月光抚慰下的花园景象非但未能平息，反而加剧了她的焦躁不安。她本欲匆匆赶往凉亭赴约，但尽管心急如焚，仍认为让苏洛斯等候方为上策。当她倚窗而立时，看见苏洛斯正穿过下方的花坛与藤架。他那异乎寻常的急促步伐与专注神态令她震惊，更对其行进方向困惑不已——那路径只会将他带离约定地点。他的身影消失在通往北花园门的柏树小径中，而当他一去不返时，她的困惑很快掺杂了惊恐与愤怒。\n\n在克桑缇卡看来，苏洛斯或任何神志清醒之人竟敢忘却约会简直匪夷所思；她推测其中必有某种邪恶强大的巫术作祟。联想到曾目睹的某些事件与诸多传言，要锁定可能的施法者并不困难。女王深知，伊拉洛莎曾为苏洛斯痴狂至癫，遭他抛弃后更是陷入无法慰藉的悲痛。人们说她曾施展各种无效咒语试图挽回，徒劳地召唤恶魔献祭，对克桑缇卡下过徒然的诅咒与死亡符咒。最终她因纯粹的懊丧绝望而死，抑或服用了某种未被察觉的毒药自尽……但正如塔苏恩普遍信奉的：女巫若带着未餍足的欲望与失效的咒法这般死去，便能化作吸血拉弥亚，藉此实现其所有巫术的终极形态……\n\n女王想起这些传闻时浑身战栗，同时忆起达成此等目的所需经历的骇人畸变：凡以此方式动用地狱之力者，必会呈现恶魔的本质与形貌。她已清晰预见苏洛斯的去向，若猜测属实，他正面临何等危险。意识到自己可能遭遇同等险境，克桑缇卡决意追踪。\n\n她几乎未作准备，因时间紧迫；只从丝绸床垫下抽出一柄直刃匕首——这淬过剧毒的凶器时刻触手可及，据说对生者亡魂皆有效验。右手持刃，左手提着日后可能需用的细缝提灯，女王悄然潜出宫殿。\n\n晚宴的残醉彻底消退，朦胧可怖的恐惧如先祖幽魂般发出警告。但她坚定地沿着苏洛斯的路径前行，那条殡葬工曾抬着伊拉洛莎棺椁走过的路。月亮如虫蛀空洞的面容，随她在树影间穿行。软底靴急促的脚步声撕裂白色寂静，仿佛撕开遮蔽幽灵秽物的蛛网薄纱。关于伊拉洛莎的诡谲传说愈发清晰地浮现，她的心脏剧烈震颤：深知自己将面对的绝非凡俗女子，而是第七重地狱唤醒的邪物。但在这恐怖寒意中，想到苏洛斯正被拉弥亚拥入怀抱，她胸膛如遭烙铁灼烧。\n\n如今墓城在克桑缇卡面前裂开巨口，小径延伸至拱顶墓树构成的幽暗洞窟，恍若通往长满白色碑林獠牙的狰狞大口。空气变得阴湿恶臭，似有敞开墓穴的吐息弥漫。女王在此踌躇，因无形黑魔仿佛正从坟土中升起，高过碑林树干，伺机袭击深入者。但她终究来到寻找的黑暗入口。她颤抖着点燃提灯，以刃状光束刺破前方浓重地底黑暗，强抑恐惧与厌恶踏入这亡者之域……或许更是永生者之巢。\n\n穿行于地下墓穴最初的转折时，她似乎仅遭遇了陈年腐霉与世纪积尘；最可怖之物不过是石龛中排列整齐的石棺——自下葬之日起便沉寂未动的石棺。此处亡者的安眠确乎未被打破，死亡的虚无依然不可侵犯。\n\n女王几乎怀疑苏洛斯未曾来过，直至灯光照出他尖头软鞋在粗靴足迹旁留下的纤细印记。她发现苏洛斯的足迹单向延伸，而殡葬工的脚印往返分明。\n\n此时前方阴影中传来声响，仿佛痴情女子的呻吟与豺狼争食的咆哮交织。她血液凝固，缓步前行，反手握紧匕首，高举提灯。那声音愈发清晰；同时飘来六月暖夜的花香，但随着深入，花香逐渐混入前所未有的窒闷恶臭，夹杂着血腥气息。\n\n再行数步，克桑缇卡如被恶魔之臂拦住：灯光照见了苏洛斯倒悬的面容与上半身，他正挂在某具闪亮新棺的边沿——这口棺椁夹在两侧锈迹斑驳的旧棺之间。他一只手僵硬地抓着棺沿，另一只虚弱移动的手似乎在爱抚上方某个朦胧形体——那东西茉莉花白的双臂在光束中显现，暗黑手指正插入他的胸膛。他的头颅与身躯宛如空壳，搭在青铜棺沿的手瘦如枯骨，全身血管凸起，仿佛被撕破的喉咙与面孔、浸透的衣衫与滴水的发丝所展现的失血量远不及实际流失。\n\n那俯身于苏洛斯之上的生物持续发出半是呻吟半是咆哮的声响。当克桑缇卡在石化般的恐惧中僵立时，苏洛斯唇间似乎逸出模糊呢喃，欢愉多于痛苦。呢喃终止后，他的头颅比先前更无力地垂下，女王认定他已真正死亡。此刻她竟生出狂怒之勇，举灯向前：即便在极端恐慌中，她仍想到或许能用淬毒匕首杀死杀害苏洛斯的怪物。\n\n摇曳灯光缓缓上移，逐寸揭露苏洛斯在黑暗中爱抚的秽恶存在……\n\n最终照见沾满猩红的肉垂，与獠牙密布、半似鸟喙的血盆大口……克桑缇卡终于明白为何苏洛斯的身体成了干瘪空壳……她所见的怪物身上，仅剩伊拉洛莎那双白皙诱人的手臂，以及正逐渐异化为非人乳房的模糊轮廓，宛如恶魔雕塑家捏制的黏土。那双臂也开始变暗畸变；与此同时，苏洛斯垂死的手再次颤动，以爱抚姿态伸向可怖之物。怪物却似浑然不觉，从他被掏空的胸腔抽出手指，突然伸展肢体越过尸体，滴着黏液的长爪直取女王。\n\n此刻克桑缇卡丢下提灯与匕首，发出无法平息的尖笑与嚎叫，在彻底疯癫中逃离墓穴。"

        "title": "The Garden of Adompha",
        "content": "\n\n\"Lord of the sultry, red parterres And orchards sunned by hell's unsetting flame! Amid thy garden blooms the Tree which bears Unnumbered heads of demons for its fruit; And, like a slithering serpeat, runs the root That is called Baaras; And there the forky, pale mandragoras, Self-torn from out the soil, go to and fro, Calling upon thy name: Till man new-damned will deem that devils pass, Crying in wrathful frenzy and strange woe.\"\n\n-Ludar's Litany to Thasaidon\n\nIt was well known that Adompha, king of the wide orient isle of Sotar, possessed amid his far-stretching palace grounds a garden secret from all men exccpt himself ahd the court magician, Dwerulas. The square-built granite walls of the garden, high and formidable as those of a prison, were plain for all to see, rearing above the stately beefwood and camphor trees, and broad plots of multi-coloured blossoms. But nothing had ever been ascertained regarding its interior: for such care as it required was given only by the wizard beneath Adompha's direction; and the twain spoke thereof in deep riddles that none could interpret. The thick brazen door responded to a mechanism whose mystery they shared with none other; and the king and Dwerulas, whether separately or together, visited the garden only at those hours when others were not abroad. And none could verily boast that he had beheld even so much as the opening of the door.\n\nMen said that the garden had been roofed over against the sun with great sheets of lead and copper, leaving no cranny through which tbe tiniest star could peer down. Some swore that the privacy of its masters during their visits was ensured by a lethean slumber which Dwerulas, through his magic art, was wont to lay at such times upon the whole vicinity.\n\nA mystery so salient could hardly fail to provoke curiosity, and sundry different beliefs arose concerning the garden's nature. Some averred that it was filled with evil plants of nocturnal habit, that yielded their swift and mordant poisons for Adompha's use, along with more insidious and baleful essences employed by the warlock in the working of his enchantments. Such tales, it seemed, were perhaps not without authority: since, fol lowing the construction of the closed garden, there had been at the royal court numerous deaths attributable to poisoning, and disasters that were plainly the sendings of a wizard, together with the bodily vanishment of peopIe whose mundane presence no longer pleased Adompha or Dwerulas.\n\nOther tales, of a more extravagant kind, were whispered among the credulous. That legend of unnatural infamy, which had surrounded the king from childhood, assumed a more hideous tinge; and Dwerulas, who had reputedly been sold to tbe Archdemon before birth by his haggish mother, acquired a new blackness of renown as one exceeding all other sorcerers in the depth and starkness of his abandonment.\n\nWaking from such slumber and such dreams as the juice of the black poppy had given him, King Adompha rose in the dead, stagnant hours between moonset and dawn. About him the palace lay hushed like a charnel-house, its occupants having yielded to their nightly sopor of wine, drugs and arrack. Around the palace, the gardens and the capital city of Loithé slept beneath slow stars of windless southern heavens. At this time Adompha and Dwerulas were wont to visit the high-walled close with little fear of being followed or observed.\n\nAdompha went forth, pausing but briefly to turn the covert eye of his black bronze lantern into the lampless chamber adjoining his own. The room had been occupied by Thuloneah, his favourite odalisque for the seldom-equalled period of eight nights; but he saw without surprise or disconcertion that the bed of disordered silks was now empty. By this, he felt sure that Dwerulas had preceded him to the garden. And he knew, moreover, that Dwerulas had not gone idly or unburdened.\n\nThe grounds of the palace, steeped everywhere in unbroken shadow, appeared to maintain that secrecy which the king pre- ferred. He came to the shut brazen door in the blankly towering wall; emitting, as he approached it, a sharp sibilation like the hissing of a cobra. In response to the rising and falling of this sound, the door swung inwards silently and closed silently behind him.\n\nThe garden, planted and tilled so privily, and sealed by its metal roof from the orbs of heaven, was illumined solely by a strange, fiery globe that hung in mid-air at the centre. Adompha regarded this globe with awe, for its nature and purveyance were mysterious to him. Dwerulas claimed that it had risen from hell on a moonless midnight at his bidding, and was levitated by infernal power, and fed with the never-dying flames of that clime in which the fruits of Thasaidon swelled to unearthly size and enchanted savour. It gave forth a sanguine light, in which the garden swam and weltered as if seen through a luminous mist of blood. Even in the bleak nights of winter, the globe yielded a genial warmth; and it fell never from its weird suspension, though without palpable support; and beneath it the garden flourished balefully, lush and exuberant as same parterre of the nether circles.\n\nIndeed, the growths of that garden were such as no terrestrial sun could have fostered, and Dwerulas said that their seed was of like origin with the globe. There were pale, bifurcated trunks that strained upwards as if to disroot themselves from the ground, unfolding immense leaves like the dark and ribbed wings of dragons. There were amaranthine blossoms, broad as salvers, supported by arm-thick stems that trembled continually.\n\nAnd there were many other weird plants, diverse as the seven hells, and having no common characteristics other than the scions which Dwerulas had grafted upon them here and there through his unnatural and necromantic art.\n\nThese scions were the various parts and members of human beings. Consumately, and with never faillng success, the magician had joined them to the half-vegetable, half-animate stocks on which they lived and grew thereafter, drawing an ichor-like sap. Thus were preserved the carefully chosen souvenirs of a multitude of persons who had inspired Dwerulas and the king with distaste or ennui. On palmy boles, beneath feathery-tufted foliage, tbe heads of eunuchs hung in bunches, like enormous black drupes. A bare, leafless creeper was flowered with the ears of delinquent guardsmen. Misshapen cacti were fruited with the breasts of women, or foliated with their hair. Entire limbs or torsos had been united with monstrous trees. Some of the huge salver-like blossoms bore palpitating hearts, and certain smaller blooms were centered with eyes that still opened and closed amid their lashes. And there were other graftings, too obscene or repellent for narration.\n\nAdompha went forward among the hybrid growths, which stirred and rustled at his approach. The heads appeared to crane towards him a little, the ears quivered, the breasts shuddered lightly, the eyes widened or narrowed as if watching his progress.\n\nThese human remnants, he knew, lived only with the sluggish life of the plants, shared only in their sub-animal activity. He had regarded them with a curious and morbid esthetic pleasure, had found in them the infallible attraction of things enormous and hypernatural. Now, for the first time, he passed among them with a languid interest. He began to apprehend that fatal hour when the garden, with all its novel thaumaturgies, would offer no longer a refuge from his inexorable ennui.\n\nAt the core of the strange pleasance, where a circular space was still vacant amid the crowding growths, Adompha came to a mound of loamy fresh-dug earth. Beside it, wholly nude, and supine as if in death, there lay the odalisque Thuloneah. Near her, various knives, and other implements, together with vials of liquid balsams and viscid gums that Dwerulas used in his grafting, had been emptied upon the ground from a leathern bag. A plant known as the dedaim, with a bulbous, pulpy, whitishgreen bole from whose centre rose and radiated several leafless reptilian boughs, dripped upon Thuloneah's bosom an occasional drop of yellowish-red ichor fmm incisions made in its smooth bark.\n\nBehind the loamy mound, DweruIas rose to view with the suddenness of a demon emerging from his subterrene lair. In his hands he held the spade with which he had just finished digging a deep and grave-like hole. Beside the regal stature and girth of Adompha, he seemed no more than a wizened dwarf. His aspect bore all the marks of immense age, as if dusty centuries had seared his flesh and sucked the blood from his veins. His eyes glowed in the bottom of pit-like orbits; his features were black and sunken as those of a long-dead corpse; his body was gnarled as some millenial desert cedar. He stooped incessantly so that his lank knotty arms hung almost to the ground. Adompha marvelled, as always, at the welI-nigh demoniac strength of those arms; marvelled that Dwerulas could have wielded the heavy shovel so expeditiously, could have carried to the garden on his back without human aid the burden of those victims whose members he had utilized in his experiments. The king had never demeaned himself to assist at such labours; but, after indicating from time to time the people whose disappearance would in no wise displease him, had done nothing more than watch and supervise the baroque gardening.\n\n'Is she dead?' Adompha questioned, eyeing the luxurious limbs and body of Thuloneah without emotion.\n\n'Nay,' said Dwerulas, in a voice harsh as a rusty coffin-hinge, 'but I have administered to her the drowsy and over-powering juice of the dedaim. Her heart beats impalpably, her blood flows with the sluggishness of that mingled ichor. She will not reawaken... save as a part of the garden's life, sharing its obscure sentience. I wait now your further instructions. What portion... or portions?'\n\n'Her hands were very deft,' said Adompha as if musing aloud, in reply to the half-uttered question 'They knew the subtle ways of love and were learned in all amorous arts. I would have you preserve her hands... but nothing else.'\n\nThe singular and magical operation had been completed. The fair, slim, tapering hands of ThuIoneah, severed cleanly at the wrists, were attached with little mark of suture to the pale and lopped extremities of the two topmost branches of the dedaim. In this process the magician had employed the gums of infernal plants, and had repeatedly invoked the curious powers of certain underground genii, as was his wont on such occasions. Now, as if in suppliance, the semi-vegetable arms reached out towards Adompha with their human hands. The king felt a revival of his old interest in Dwerulas' horticulture, a queer excitement woke within him before the mingled grotesquery and beauty of the grafted plant. At the same time there lived again in his flesh the subtle ardours of outworn nights... for the hands were filled with memories.\n\nHe had quite forgotten Thuloneah's body, lying close by with its maimed arms. Recalled from his reverie by the sudden movement of Dwerulas, he turned and saw the wizard stooping above the unconscious girl; who had not stirred during the whole course of the operation. Blood still flowed and puddled upon the dark earth from the stumps of her wrists. Dwerulas, with that unnatural vigour which informed all his movements, seized the odalisque in his pipy arms and swung her easily aloft. His air was that of a labourer resuming his unfinished task; but he seemed to hesitate before casting her inio the hole that would serve as a grave; where, through seasons warmed and illumined by the hell- drawn globe, her golden, decaying body would feed the roots of that anomalous plant which bore her own hands for scions. It was as if he were loath to relinquish his voluptuous burden. Adompha, watching him curiously, was aware as never before of the stark evil and turpitude that flowed like an overwhelming fetor from Dwerulas' hunched body and twisted limbs.\n\nDeeply as he himself had gone into all manner of iniquities, the king felt a vague revulsion. Dwerulas reminded him of a loathsome insect that he had once surprised during its ghoulish activities. He remembered how he had crushed the insect with a stone... and remembering, he conceived one of those bold and sudden inspirations that had always impelled him to equally sudden action. He had not, he told himself, entered the garden with any such thought: but the opportunity was too urgent and too perfect to be overpassed. The wizard's back was turned to him for the nonce; the arms of the wizard were encumbered with their heavy and pulchritudinous load. Snatching up the iron spade, Adompha brought it down on the small, withered head of Dwerulas with a fair amount of war-like strength inherited from heroic and piratic ancestors. The dwarf, still carrying Thuloneah, toppled forward into the deep pit.\n\nPosing the spade for a second blow if such should be necessary, the king waited; but there was neither sound nor movement from the grave. He felt a certain surprise at having overcome with such ease the formidable magician, of whose superhuman powers he was half convinced; a certain surprise, too, at his own temerity. Then, reassured by his triumph, the king bethought him that he might try an experiment of his own: since he believed himself to have mastered much of Dwerulas' peculiar skill and lore through observation. The head of Dwerulas would form a unique and suitable addition to one of the garden plants. However, upon peering into the pit, he was forced to relinquish the idea: for he saw that he had struck only too well and had reduced the sorcerer's head to a state in which it was useless for his experiment, since such graftings required a certain integrity of the human part or member.\n\nReflecting, not without disgust, on the unlooked-for frailty of the skulls of magicians, which were as easily squashed as emus' eggs, Adompha began to fill the pit with loam, The prone body of Dwerulas, the huddled form af Thuloneah beneath it, sharing the same inertness, were soon covered from view by the soft and dissolving clods. The king, who had grown to fear Dwerulas in his heart, was aware of a distinct relief when he had tamped the grave down very firmly and had leveled it smoothly with the surrounding soil. He told himself that he had done well: for the magician's stock of learning had come latterly to include too many royal secrets; and power such as his, whether drawn from nature or from occult realms, was never quite compatible with the secure dominion and prolonged empire of kings.\n\nAt King Adompha's court and throughout the sea-bordering city of Loithé, the vanishment of Dwerulas became the cause of much speculation but little inquiry. There was a division of opinio as to whether Adompha or the fiend Thasaidon could be thanked for so salutary a riddance; and in consequence, the king of Sotar and the lord of the seven hells were both feared and respected as never before. Only the most redoubtable of men or demons could have made away with Dwerulas, who was said to have lived through a whole millenium never sleepiag for one night, and crowding all his hours with iniquities and sorceries of a sub-tartarean blackness.\n\nFollowing the inhumation of Dwerulas, a dim sentiment of fear and horror, for which he could not altogether account, had prevented the king from revisiting the sealed garden. Smiling impassively at the wild rumours of the court, he continued his search for novel pleasures and violent or rare sensations. In this, however, he met with small success: it seemed that every path, even the most outré and tortuous, led only to the hidden precipice of boredom. Turning from strange loves and cruelties, from extravagant pomps and mad music; from the aphrodisiac censers of far-sought blossoms, the quaintly shapen breasts of exotic girls, he recalled with new longing those semi-animate floral forms that had been endowed by Dwerulas with the most provocative charms of women.\n\nSo, on a latter night, at an hour midway between moonfall and sunrise, when all the palace and the city of Loithé were plunged in sodden slumber, the king arose from beside his concubine; and went forth to the garden that was now secret from all men excepting himself.\n\nIn answer to the cobra-like sibilation, which alone could actuate its cunning mechanisn, the door opened to Adompha and closed behind him. Even as it closed, he grew aware that a singular change had come upon the garden during his absence. Burning with a bloodier light, a more torrid radiation, the mysterious air-hung globe glared down as it fanned by wrathful demons; and the plants, which had grown excessively in height, and were muffled and hooded with a heavier foliage than they had worn priorly, stood motionless amid an atmosphere that was like the heated breath of some crimson hell.\n\nAdompha hesitated, doubtful of the meaning of these changes. For a moment he thought of Dwerulas, and recalled with a slight shiver certain unexplained prodigies and necromantic feats performed by the wizard... But he had slain Dwerulas and had buried him with his own royal hands. The waxing heat and radiance of that globe, the excessive growth of the garden, were no doubt due to some uncontrolled natural process.\n\nHeld by a strong curiosity, the king inhaled the giddying perfumes that came to assail his nostrils. The light dazzled his eyes filling them with queer, unheard-of colours; the heat smote upon him as if from a nether solstice of infernal summer. He thought that he heard voices, almost inaudible at first, but mounting anon to a half-articulate murmur that seduced his ear with unearthly sweetness. At the same time he seemed to behold amid the stirless vegetation, in flashing glimpses, the half-veiled limbs of dancing bayaderes; limbs that he could not identify with any of the graftings made by Dwerulas.\n\nDrawn by the charm of mystery and seized by a vague intoxication, the king went forward into the hell-born labyrinth. The plants recoiled gently when he neared them, and drew back on either side to permit his passage. As if in arboreal masquerade, they seemed to hide their human scions behind the mantles of their new-grown leafage. Then, closing behind Adompha, they appeared to cast off their disguise, revealing wilder and more anomalous fusions than he had remembered. They changed about him from instant to instant like shapes of delirium, so that he was never quite sure how much of their semblance was tree and flower, how much was woman and man. By turns he beheld a swinging of convulsed foliage, a commotion of riotous limbs and bodies. Then, by some undiscerned transition, it seemed that they were no longer rooted in the groud but were moving about him on dim, fantastic feet in ever-swiftening circles, like the dancers of some bewildering festival.\n\nAround and around Adompha raced the forms that were both floral and human; till the dizzy madness of their motion swirled with an equal vertigo through his brain. He heard the soughing of a storm-driven forest, together with a clamouring of familiar voices that called him by name, that cursed or supplicated, mocked or exhorted, in myriad tones of warrior, councillor, slave, courtling, castrado or leman. Over all, the sanguine globe blazed down with an ever-brightening and more baleful effulgence, an ardour that became always more insupportable. It was as if the whole life of the garden turned and rose and flamed ecstatically to some infernal culmination.\n\nKing Adompha had lost all memory of Dwerulas and his dark magic. In his senses burned the ardour of the hell-risen orb, and he seemed to share the delirious motion and ecstasy of those obscure shapes by which he was surrounded. A mad ichor mounted in his bhod; before him hovered the vague images of pleasures be had never known or suspected: pleasures in which he wauld pass far beyond the ordained limits of mortal sensation.\n\nThen, amid that whirling fantasmagoria, he heard the screeching of a voice that was harsh as some rusty hinge on the lifted lid of a sarcophagus. He could not understand the words: but, as if a spell of stillness had been uttered, the whole garden resumed immediately a hushed and hodded aspect. The king stood in a very stupor: far the voice had been that of Dwerulas! He looked about him wildly, bemazed and bewildered, seeing only the still plants with their mantling of profuse leafage. Before him towered a growth which he somehew recognized as the dedaim, though its bulb-shaped bole and elongated branches had put forth a matted-nass of dark, hair-like filaments.\n\nVery slowly and gently, the two topmost branches of the dedaim descended till their tips were level with Adompha's face. The slender, tapering hands of Thuloneah emerged from their foliage and began to caress the king's cheeks with that loverlike adroitness which he still remembered. At the same moment, he saw the thick hairy matting fall apart upon the broad and flattish top of the dedaim's bole; and from it, as if rearing from hunched shoulders, the small, wizened head of Dwerulas rose up, to confront him...\n\nStill gazing in vacuous horror at the crushed and blood-clotted cranium, at the features seared and blackened as if by centuries, at the eyes that glowed in dark pits like embers blown by demons, Adompha had the confused impression of a multitude of people that hurled themselves upon him from every side. There were no longer any trees in that garden of mad minglings and sorcerous transformations. About him in the fiery air swam faces that he recalled only too well: faces now contorted with rage. and the lethal lust of revenge. Through an irony which Dwerulas alone could have conceived, the soft fingers of Thuloneah continued to caress him, while he felt the clutching of numberless hands that tore all his garments into rags and shredded all his flesh with their nails.",

        "content": "\n\nI remember that I grumbled a little when Mior Lumivix awakened me. The past evening had been a tedious one with its unpleasant familiar vigil, during which I had nodded often. From sunfall till the setting of Scorpio, which occurred well after midnight at that season, it had been my duty to tend the gradual inspissation of a decoction of scarabs, much favored by Mior Lumivix in the compounding of his most requested love-potions. He had warned me often that this liquor must be thickened neither too slowly nor too rapidly, by maintaining an even fire in the athanor, and had cursed me more than once for spoiling it. Therefore, I did not yield to my drowsiness till the decoction was safely decanted and strained thrice through the sieve of perforated sharkskin.\n\nTaciturn beyond his wont, the Master had retired early to his chamber. I knew that something troubled him; but was too tired for overmuch conjecture, and had not dared to question him.\n\nIt seemed that I had not slept for more than the period of a few pulse-beats — and here was the Master thrusting the yellow-slotted eye of his lantern into my face and dragging me from the pallet. I knew that I should not sleep again that night: for the Master wore his one-horned hat, and his cloak was girdled tightly about him, with the ancient arthame depending from the girdle in its shagreen sheath that time and the hands of many magicians had blackened.\n\n'Abortion fathered by a sloth! ' he cried. 'Suckling of a sow that has eaten mandragora! Would you slumber till doomsday? We must hurry: I have learned that Sarcand has procured the chart of Omvor and has gone forth alone to the wharv'es. No doubt he means to embark in quest of the temple-treasure. We must follow quickly for much time has already been lost.'\n\nI rose now without further demur and dressed myself expeditiously, knowing well the urgency of this matter. Sarcand, who had but lately come to the city of Mirouane, had already made himself the most formidable of all my master's competitors. It was said that he was native to Naat, amid the sombre western ocean, having been begotten by a sorcerer of that isle on a woman of the black cannibals who dwell beyond its middle mountains. He combined his mother's savage nature with the dark necromantic craft of his father; and, moreover, had acquired much dubious knowledge and repute in his travels through orient kingdoms before settling in Mirouane.\n\nThe fabulous chart of Omvor, dating from lost ages, was a thing that many generations of wizards had dreamt to find. Omvor, an ancient pirate still renowned, had performed successfully a feat of impious rashness. Sailing up a closely guarded estuary by night with his small crew disguised as priests in stolen temple-barges, he had looted the fane of the Moon-God in Faraad and had carried away many of its virgins, together with gems, gold, altar-vessels, talismans, phylacteries and books of eldritch elder magic. These books were the gravest loss of all, since even the priests had never dared to copy them. They were unique and irreplaceable, containing the erudition of buried aeons.\n\nOmvor's feat had given rise to many legends. He and his crew and the ravished virgins, in two small brigantines, had vanished ultimately amid the western seas. It was believed that they had been caught by the Black River, that terrible ocean-stream which pours with an irresistible swiftening beyond Naat to the world's end. But before that final voyage, Omvor had lightened his vessels of the looted treasure and had made a chart on which the location of its hiding-place was indicated. This chart he had given to a former comrade who had grown too old for voyaging.\n\nNo man had ever found the treasure. But it was said that the chart still existed throughout the centuries, hidden somewhere no less securely than the loot of the Moon-God's temple. Of late there were rumors that some sailor, inheriting it from his father, had brought the map to Mirouane. Mior Lumivix, through agents both human and preterhuman, had tried vainly to trace the-sailor; knowing that Sarcand had the other wizards of the city were also seeking him.\n\nThis much was known to me; and the Master told me more while, at his bidding, I collected hastily such provisions as were needed for a voyage of several days.\n\n'I had watched Sarcand like an osprey watching its nest,' he said. 'My familiars told me that he had found the chart's owner, and had hired some thief to steal it; but they could tell me little else. Even the eyes of my devil-cat, peering through his windows, were baffled by the cuttle-fish darkness with which his magic surrounds him at will.\n\n'Tonight I did a dangerous thing, since there was no other way. Drinking the juice of the purple dedaim, which induces profound trance, I projected my ka into his elemental-guarded chamber. The elementals knew my presence, they gathered about me in shapes of fire and shadow, menacing me unspeakably. They opposed me, they drove me forth... but I had seen — enough.'\n\nThe Master paused, bidding me gird myself with a consecrated magic sword, similar to his own but of less antiquity, which he had never before allowed me to wear. By this time I had gathered together the required provision of food and drink, storing it in a strong fish-net that I could carry easily over my shoulder by the handle. The net was one that was used mainly for catching certain sea-reptiles, from which Mior Lumivix extracted a venom possessing unique virtue.\n\nIt was not till we had locked all the portals, and had plunged into the dark seaward-winding streets, that the Master resumed his account:\n\n'A man was leaving Sarcand's chamber at the moment of my entrance. I saw him briefly, ere the black arras parted and closed; but I shall know him again. He was young and plump, with powerful sinews under the plumpness, with slanted squinting eyes in a girlish face and the swart yellow skin of a man from the southern isles. He wore the short breeks and ankle-topping boots of a mariner, being otherwise naked.\n\n'Sarcand was sitting with his back half-turned, holding an unrolled sheet of papyrus, yellow as the sailor's face, to that evil, four-horned lamp which he feeds with cobras' oil. The lamp glared like a ghoul's eye. But I looked over his shoulder ... long enough... before his demons could hurry me from the room. The papyrus was indeed the chart of Omvor. It was stiff with age, and stained with blood and sea-water. But its title and purpose and appellations were still legible, though inscribed in an archaic script that few can read nowadays.\n\n'It showed the western shore of the continent Zothique, and the seas beyond. An isle lying due westward from Mirouane was indicated as the burial-place of the treasure. It was named the Island of Crabs on the chart: but plainly it is none other than the one now called Iribos which, though seldom visited, lies at a distance of only two days' voyaging. There are no other islands within a hundred leagues, either north or south, excepting a few desolate rocks and small atolls.'\n\nUrging me to greater haste, Mior Lumivix continued:\n\n'I woke too tardily from the swoon induced by the dedaim. A lesser adept would never have awakened at all.\n\n'My familiars warned me that Sarcand had left his house a full hour ago. He was prepared for a journey, and went wharfward. But we will overtake him. I think that he will go without companions to Iribos, desiring to keep the treasure wholly secret. He is indeed strong and terrible, but his demons are of a kind that cannot cross water, being entirely earthbound. He has left them behind with moiety of his magic. Have no fear for the outcome.'\n\nThe wharves were still and almost deserted, except for a few sleeping sailors who had succumbed to the rank wine and arrack of the taverns. Under the late moon, that had curved and sharpened to a slim scimitar, we unmoored our boat and pushed away, the Master holding the tiller, while I bent my shoulders to the broad-bladed oars. Thus we threaded the huddled maze of far-gathered ships, of xebecs and galleys, of river-barges and scows and feluccas, that thronged that immemorial harbor. The sluggish air, hardly stirring our tall lateen sail, was pregnant with sea-smells, with the reek of laden fishing-boats and the spices of exotic cargoes. None hailed us; and we heard only the calling of watchmen on shadowy decks, proclaiming the hour in outlandish tongues.\n\nOur boat, though small and open, was stoutly built of orient beef-wood. Sharply prowed and deeply keeled, with high bulwarks, it had proven itself seaworthy even in tempests such as were not to be apprehended at this season.\n\nBlowing over Mirouane, from fields and orchards and desert kingdoms, a wind freshened behind us as we cleared the harbor. It stiffened, till the sail bellied like a dragon's wing. The furrows of foam curved high beside our sharp prow, as we followed Capricornus down the west.\n\nFar out on the waters before us, in the dim moonlight, something seemed to move, to dance and waver like a phantom. Perhaps it was Sarcand's boat... or another's. Doubtlcss, the Master also saw it; but he said only:\n\n'You may sleep now.'\n\nSo I, Manthar the apprentice, composed myself to slumber, while Mior Lumivix steered on, and the starry hooves and horns of the Goat sank seaward.\n\nThe sun was high above our stern when I awakened. The wind still blew, strong and favorable, driving us into the west with unabated speed. We had passed beyond sight of the shore-line of Zothique. The sky was void of clouds, the sea vacant of any sail, unrolling before us like a vast scroll of sonbre azure, lined only with the shifting and fading foamcrests.\n\nThe day went by, ebbing beyond the still-empty horizon; and night overtook us like the heaven-blotting purple sail of a god, sewn with the Signs and planets. The night too went over, and a second dawn.\n\nAll this time, without sleeping, the Master had steered the boat, with eyes peering implacably westward like those of an ocean-hawk; and I wondered greatly at his endurance. Now for awhile he slept, sitting upright at the helm. But it seemed that his eyes were still vigilant behiad their lids; and his hand still held the rudder straight, without slackening.\n\nIn a few hours the Master opened his eyes; but hardly stirred from the posture he maintained throughout.\n\nHe had spoken little during our voyage. I did not question him, knowing that he would tell me whatever was needed at the due time. But I was full of curiosities; and was not without fear and doubt regarding Sarcand, whose rumored necromancies might well have dismayed others than a mere novice. I could surmise nothing of the Master's thoughts, except that they concerned dark and esoteric matters.\n\nHaving slept for the third time since our embarkment, I was roused by the Master crying loudly. In the dimness of the third dawn, an island towered before us, impending with jagged cliffs and jotting crags, and barring the sea for several leagues to northward and southward. It was shaped somewhat like a monster, facing north. Its head was a high-horned promontory, dipping a great griffin-like beak in the ocean.\n\n'This is Iribos,' the Master told me. 'The sea is strong about it, with strange tides and perilous currents. There are no landing-places on this side, and we must not venture too close. We must round the northern headland. There is a small cove amid the western cliffs, entered only through a sea-cavern. It is there that the treasure lies.'\n\nWe tacked northward slowly and deviously against the wind, at a distance of three or four bow-shots from the island. As our sea-craft was required to make progress: for the wind strengthened wildly, as if swollen by the breath of devils. Above its howling we heard the surf's clamor upon those monstrous rocks that rose bare and gaunt from cerements of foam.\n\n'The isle is unpeopled,' said Mior Lumivix. 'It is shunned by sailors and even by the sea-fowl. Men say that the curse of the maritime gods was laid upon it long ago, forbidding it to any but the creatures of the submarine deep. Its coves and caverns are haunted by crabs and octopi... and perhaps by stranger things.'\n\nWe sailed on in a tedious serpentine course, beaten back at times or borne perilously shoreward by the shifting gusts that opposed us like evil demons. The sun climbed in the orient, shining starkly down on the desolation of crags and scarps that was Iribos. Still we tacked and veered; and I seemed to sense the beginning of a strange unease in the Master. But of this, if such there was, his manner betrayed no sign.\n\nIt was almost noon when we rounded at last the long beak of the northern promontory. There, when we turned southerly, the wind fell in a weird stillness, and the sea was miraculously calmed as if by wizard oils. Our sail hung limp and useless above mirror-like waters, in which it seemed that the boat's reflected image and ours, unbroken, moveless, might float forever amid the unchanging reflection of the monstershapen isle. We both began to ply the oars; but even thus the boat crawled with a singular slowness.\n\nI observed the isle strictly as we passed along, noting several inlets where, to all appearance, a vessel could have landed readily.\n\n'There is much danger here,' said Mior Lumivix, without elucidating his statement.\n\nAgain, as we continued, the cliffs became a wall that was broken only by rifts and chasms. They were crowned in places by a sparse, funereal-colored vegetation that hardly served to soften their formidable aspect. High up in the clefted rocks, where it seemed that no natural tide or tempest could have flung them, I observed the scattered spars and timbers of antique vessels.\n\n'Row closer,' enjoined the Master. 'We are nearing the cavern that leads to the hidden inlet.'\n\nEven as we veered landward through the crystalline calm, there was a sudden seething and riffling about us, as if some monster had risen beneath. The boat began to shoot with plummet-like speed toward the cliffs, the sea foaming and streaming all around as though some kraken were dragging us to its caverned lair. Borne like a leaf on a cataract, we toiled vainly with straining oars against the ineluctable current.\n\nHeaving higher momentarily, the cliffs seemed to shear the heavens above us, unscalable, without ledge or foothold. Then, in the sheer wall, appeared the low, broad arch of a cavern-mouth that we had not discerned heretofore, toward which the boat was drawn with dreadful swiftness.\n\n'It is the entrance! ' cried the Master. 'But some wizard tide has flooded it.'\n\nWe shipped our useless oars and crouched down behind the thwarts as we neared the opening: for it seemed that the lowness of the arch would afford bare passage to our high-built prow. There was no time to unstep the mast, which broke instantly like a reed as we raced on without slackening into blind torrential darkness.\n\nHalf-stunned, and striving to extricate myself from the fallen, spar-weighted sail, I felt the chillness of water splashing about me and knew that the boat was filling and sinking. A moment more, and the water was in my ears and eyes and nostrils: but even as I sank and drowned there was still the sense of swift onward motion. Then it seemed dimly that arms were around me in the strangling darkness; and I rose suddenly, choking and gasping and spewing, into sunlight.\n\nWhen I had rid my lungs of the brine and regained my senses more fully, I found that Mior Lumivix and I were floating in a small haven, shaped like a half-moon, and surrounded by crags and pinnacles of sullen-colored rock. Close by, in a sheer, straight wall, was the inner mouth of the cavern through which the mysterious current had carried us, with faint ripples spreading around it and fading away into water smooth and green as a platter of jade. Opposite, on the haven's farther side, was the long curve of a shelving beach strewn with boulders and driftwood. A boat resembling ours, with an unshipped mast and a furled sail the color of fresh blood, was moored to the beach. Near it, from the shoaling water, protruded the broken-off mast of another boat, whose sunken outlines we discerned obscurely. Two objects which we took for human figures were lying half in and half out of the shallows a little farther along the strand. At that distance we could hardly know whether they were living men or cadavers. Their contours were half-hidden by what seemed a curious sort of brownish-yellow drapery that trailed away amid the rocks, appearing to move and shift and waver incessantly.\n\n'There is mystery here,' said Mior Lumivix in a low voice. 'We must proceed with care and circumspection.'\n\nWe swam ashore at the near end of the beach, where it narrowed like the tip of a crescent moon to meet the sea-wall. Taking his arthame from its sheath the Master wiped it dry with the hem of his cloak, bidding me do likewise with my own weapon lest the brine corrode it. Then, hiding the wizard blades beneath our raiment, we followed the broadening beach toward the moored boat and the two reclining figures.\n\n'This is indeed the place of Omvor's chart,' observed the Master. 'The boat with the blood-red sail belongs to Sarcand. No doubt he has found the cave, which lies hidden somewhere among the rocks. But who are these others? I do not think that they came with Sarcand.'\n\nAs we neared the figures, the appearance of a yellowishbrown drapery that covered them resolved itself in its true nature. It consisted of a great number of crabs who were crawling over their half-submerged bodies and running to and fro behind a heap of immense boulders.\n\nWe went forward and stopped over the bodies, from which the crabs were busily detaching morsels of bloody flesh. One of the bodies lay on its face; the other stared with half-eaten features at the sun. Their skin, or what remained of it, was a swarthy yellow. Both were clad in short purple breeks and sailor's boots, being otherwise naked.\n\n'What hellishness is this?' inquired the Master. 'These men are but newly dead — and already the crabs rend them. Such creatures are wont to wait for the softening of decomposition. And look — they do not even devour the morsels they have torn, but bear them away.'\n\nThis indeed was true, for I saw now that a constant procession of crabs departed from the bodies, each carrying a shred of flesh, to vanish beyond the rocks; while another procession came, or perhaps returned, with empty pincers.\n\n'I think,' said Mior Lumivix, 'that the man with the upturned face is the sailor that I saw leaving Sarcand's room; the thief who had stolen the chart for Sarcand from its owner.'\n\nIn my horror and disgust I had picked up a fragment of rock and was about to crush some of the hideously laden crabs as they crawled away from the corpses.\n\n'Nay,' the Master stayed me, 'let us follow them.'\n\nRounding the great heap of boulders, we saw that the twofold procession entered, and emerged from, the mouth of a cavern that had heretofore been hidden from view.\n\nWith hands tightening on the hilts of our arthames, we went cautiously and circumspectly toward the cavern and paused a little short of its entrance. From this vantage, however, nothing was visible within except the lines of crawling crabs.\n\n'Enter! ' cried a sonorous voice that seemed to prolong and repeat the word in far-receding reverberations, like the voice of a ghoul echoing in some profound sepulchral vault.\n\nThe voice was that of the sorcerer Sarcand. The Master looked at me, with whole volumes of warning in his narrowed eyes and we entered the cavern.\n\nThe place was high-domed and of indeterminable extent. Light was afforded by a great rift in the vault above, through which, at this hour, the direct rays of the sun slanted in, falling goldenly on the cavern's foreground and tipping with light the great fangs of stalactites and stalagmites in the gloom beyond. At one side was a pool of water, fed by a thin rill from a spring that dripped somewhere in the darkness.\n\nWith the shafted splendor shining full upon him, Sarcand reposed half-sitting, half-recumbent, with his back against an open chest of age-darkened bronze. His huge ebon-black body, powerfully muscled though inclining toward corpulence, was nude except for a necklace of rubies, each the size of a plover's egg, that depended about his throat. His crimson sarong, strangely tattered, bared his legs as they lay outstretched amid the cavern's rubbie. The right leg had manifestly been broken somewhere below the knee, for it was rudely bound with splints of driftwood and strips torn from the sarong.\n\nSarcand's cloak of lazuli-colored silk was outspread beside him. It was strewn with graven gems and amulets, with gold coins and jewel-crusted altar-vessels, that Hashed and glittered amid volumens of parchments and papyrus. A book with black metal covers lay open as if newly put aside, showing illuminations drawn in fiery ancient inks.\n\nBeside the book, within reach of Sarcand's fingers, was a mound of raw and bloody shreds. Over the cloak, over the coins and scrolls and jewels, crawled the incoming lines of crabs, each of which added its torn-off morsel to the mound and then crept on to join the outgoing column.\n\nI could well believe the tales regarding Sarcand's ancestry. indeed, it seemed that he favored his mother entirely: for his hair and features as well as his skin were those of the Negro cannibals of Naat as I had seen them depicted in travelers' drawings. He fronted us inscrutably, his arms crossed on his bosom. I noticed a great emerald shining darkly on the index finger of his right hand.\n\n'I knew that you would follow me,' he said, 'even as I knew that the thief and his companion would follow. All of you have thought to slay me and take the treasure. It is true that I have suffered an injury: a fragment of loosened rock fell from the cavern-roof, breaking my leg as I bent over to inspect the treasures in the opened chest. I must lie here till the bone has knit. In the meanwhile I am well armed... and well served and guarded.'\n\n'We came to take the treasure,' replied Mior Lumivix directly. 'I had thought to slay you, but only in fair combat, man to man and wizard to wizard, with none but my neophyte Manthar and the rocks of Iribos for witness.'\n\n'Aye, and your neophyte is also armed with an arthame. However, it matters little. I shall feast on your liver, Mior Lumivix, and wax stronger by such power of sorcery as was yours.'\n\nThis the Master appeared to disregard.\n\n'What foulness have you conjured now?' he inquired sharply, pointing to the crabs who were still depositing their morsels on the grisly mound.\n\nSarcand held aloft the hand on whose index finger gleamed the immense emerald, set, as we now perceived, in a ring that was wrought with the tentacles of a kraken clasping the orblike gem.\n\n'I found this ring amid the treasure,' he boasted. 'It was closed in a cylinder of unknown metal, together with a scroll that informed me of the ring's uses and its mighty magic. It is the signet-ring of Basatan, the sea-god. He who looks long and deeply into the emerald may behold distant scenes and happenings at will. He who wears the ring can exert control over the winds and currents of the sea and over the sea's creatures, by describing certain signs in air with his finger.'\n\nWhile Sarcand spoke it seemed that the green jewel brightened and darkened and deepened strangely, like a tiny window with all the sea's mystery and immensity lying beyond. Enthralled and entranced, I forgot the circumstances of our situation: for the jewel swelled upon my vision, blotting from view the black fingers of Sarcand, with a swirling as of tides and of shadowy fins and tentacles far down in its glimmering greenness.\n\n'Beware, Manthar,' the Master murmured in my ear. 'We face a dreadful magic, and must retain the command of all our faculties. Avert your eyes from the emerald.'\n\nI obeyed the dimly heard whisper. The vision dwindled away, vanishing swiftly, and the form and features of Sarcand returned. His lubber lips were curved in a broad sardonic grin, showing his strong white teeth that were pointed like those of a shark. He dropped the huge hand that wore the signet of Basatan, plunging it into the chest behind him and bringing it forth filled with many-tinted gems, with pearls, opals, sapphires, bloodstones, diamonds, chatoyants. These he let dribble in a flashing rill from his fingers, as he resumed his peroration:\n\n'I preceded you to Iribos by many hours. It was known to me that the outer cavern could be entered safely only at low tide, with an unstepped mast.\n\n'Perhaps you have already inferred whatever else I might tell you. At any rate the knowledge will perish with you very shortly.\n\n'After learning the uses of the ring I was able to watch the seas round Iribos in the jewel. Lying here with my shattered leg, I saw the approach of the thief and his fellow. I called up the sea-current by which their boat was drawn into the flooded cavern, sinking swiftly. They would have swum ashore: but at my command the crabs in the haven drew them under and drowned them; letting the tide beach their corpses later... That cursed thief! I had paid him well for the stolen chart, which he was too ignorant to read, suspecting only that it concerned a treasure-trove...\n\n'Still later I trapped you in the same fashion, after delaying you awhile with contrary winds and an adverse calm. I have preserved you, however, for another doom than drowning.'\n\nThe voice of the necromancer sank away in profound echoes, leaving a silence fraught with insufferable suspense. It seemed that we stood amid the gaping of undiscovered gulfs, in a place of awful darkness, lit only by the eyes of Sarcand and the ring's talismanic jewel.\n\nThe spell that had fallen upon me was broken by the cold ironic tones of the Master:\n\n'Sarcand, there is another sorcery that you have not mentioned.'\n\nSarcand's laughter was like the sound of a mounting surf. 'I follow the custom of my mother's people; and the crabs serve me with that which I require, summoned and constrained by the sea-god's ring.'\n\nSo saying, he raised his hand and described a peculiar sign with the index finger, on which the ring flashed like a circling orb. The double column of crabs suspended their crawling for a moment. Then, moved as if by a single impulse, they began to scuttle toward us, while others appeared from the cavern's entrance and from its inner recesses to swell their rapidly growing numbers. They surged upon us with a speed beyond belief, assailing our ankles and shins with their knife-sharp pincers as if animated by demons. I stooped over, striking and thrusting with my arthame; but the few that I crushed in this manner were replaced by scores; while others, catching the hem of my cloak, began to climb it from behind and weigh it down. Thus encumbered, I lost my footing on the slippery ground and fell backward amid the scuttling multitude.\n\nLying there while the crabs poured over me like a seething wave, I saw the Master shed his burdened cloak and cast it aside. Then, while the spell-drawn army still besieged him, climbing upon each other's backs and scaling his very knees and thighs, he hurled his arthame with a strange circular motion at the upraised arm of Sarcand. Straightly the blade flew, revolving like a disk of brightness; and the hand of the black necromancer was sundered cleanly at the wrist, and the ring flashed on its index finger like a falling star as it fell groundward.\n\nBlood spouted in a fountain from the handless wrist, while Sarcand sat as in a stupor, maintaining for a brief instant the gesture of his conjuration. Then his arm dropped to his side and the blood rilled out upon the littered cloak, spreading swiftly amid the gems and coins and volumens, and staining the mound of crab-deposited morsels. As if the arm's movement had been another signal, the crabs fell away from the Master and myself and swarmed in a long, innumerable tide toward Sarcand. They covered his legs, they climbed his great torso, they scrambled for place on his escaladed shoulders. He tore them away with his one hand, roaring terrible curses and imprecations that rolled in countless echoes throughout the cavern. But the crabs still assailed him as if driven by some demoniac frenzy; and blood trickled forth more and more copiously from the small wounds they had made, to suffuse their pincers and streak their shells with broadening rillets of crimson.\n\nIt seemed that long hours went by while the Master and I stood watching. At last the prostrate thing that was Sarcand had ceased to heave and toss under the living shroud that enswathed it. Only the splint-bound leg and the lopped-off hand with the ring of Basatan remained untouched by the loathsomely busied crabs.\n\n'Faugh! ' the Master exclaimed. 'He left his devils behind when he came here; but he found others... It is time that we went out for a walk in the sun. Manthar, my good lubberly apprentice, I would have you build a fire of driftwood on the beach. Pile on the fuel without sparing, to make a bed of coals deep and hot and red as the hearth of hell, in which to roast us a dozen crabs. But be careful to choose the ones that have come freshly from the sea.'",
        "content_cn": "我记得当米奥尔·卢米维克斯唤醒我时，自己曾低声抱怨过几句。前夜的守候令人疲惫不堪，其间我频频打盹。从日落到天蝎座西沉——在那个季节里，这要等到午夜过后许久——我的职责便是照看那锅甲虫煎剂的缓慢浓缩过程，这是米奥尔·卢米维克斯配制最抢手的爱情魔药时最钟爱的原料。他屡次警告我，必须通过恒温炉保持稳定火候，让药液既不能凝结得太慢也不可太快，并多次因我熬坏药剂而咒骂不休。因此直到药液被安全倾出，并用穿孔鲨鱼皮筛网过滤三遍后，我才向睡意屈服。\n\n比平日更为沉默的师父早早回到了寝室。我知道有什么事情困扰着他；但我实在太疲倦，无力多加揣测，更不敢贸然询问。\n\n我仿佛刚合眼不过脉搏跳动几下——师父便提着灯笼，将那泛着黄色光隙的灯罩直戳到我脸上，将我从床铺拖起。我明白今夜再无安眠：师父戴着他那支独角帽，斗篷紧紧束在身上，古老的仪式匕首悬于腰际，包裹在因岁月与无数术士之手而泛黑的鲨皮鞘中。\n\n\"树懒养出的孽种！\"他厉声喝道，\"吞食曼德拉草的母猪崽子！你要睡到末日审判吗？我们必须抓紧：我已获悉萨坎德弄到了奥姆沃的海图，正独自前往码头。他显然打算启程寻找神庙宝藏。我们得立刻追赶，已经耽误太多时间了。\"\n\n此刻我不再迟疑，迅速起身着装，深知此事迫在眉睫。刚来到米鲁安城不久的萨坎德，已然成为师父所有竞争者中最令人忌惮的对手。传闻他出生于西方幽暗海域中的纳特岛，是岛上术士与中部山脉以外黑人食人族女子所生。他继承了母亲的野蛮天性，又习得父亲的黑巫术；更在定居米鲁安前，游历东方诸国时获取了大量可疑的知识与名声。\n\n来自失落年代的奥姆沃传奇海图，是历代巫师梦寐以求的宝物。这位至今仍声名显赫的古海盗曾完成过亵渎神明的壮举。他率领伪装成祭司的小队，乘着偷来的神庙驳船夜袭戒备森严的河口，洗劫了法拉德的月神庙，掳走众多女祭司，以及宝石、黄金、圣器、护符、经匣与记载远古邪术的典籍。这些典籍的流失最为致命，连神庙祭司都未曾敢抄录副本。它们独一无二，蕴藏着被埋葬纪元的知识。\n\n奥姆沃的事迹衍生出无数传说。他与船员及被劫持的女祭司们，乘两艘小型双桅船最终消失在西方的海域。据信他们被黑潮捕获——那道可怖的海流以不可阻挡之势掠过纳特岛直抵世界尽头。但在那次终极航行前，奥姆沃为减轻船只负重藏匿了财宝，并绘制标记埋藏点的海图。他将海图赠予了一位年迈无法远航的老同伴。\n\n从未有人发现过这批宝藏。但传言数个世纪以来，这张海图始终存在，其藏匿之处不亚于月神庙珍宝的隐秘。近来有风声说某位水手从父亲处继承此图，并将其带到了米鲁安。米奥尔·卢米维克斯通过人类与非人类的眼线，始终未能追踪到这名水手；而萨坎德与城中其他巫师同样在搜寻此人。\n\n这些是我已知的讯息；当我按师父吩咐匆忙收拾数日航行所需物资时，他又透露了更多。\n\n\"我像鱼鹰守护巢穴般监视着萨坎德，\"他说，\"我的使魔报告说他找到了海图主人，并雇窃贼将其偷走；但它们无法提供更多情报。就连我的魔猫之眼透过窗户窥视时，也会被他随心召唤的乌贼般黑暗所迷惑。\"\n\n\"今夜我做了件危险之事，因别无选择。饮下能诱发深度恍惚的紫色迪代姆汁液后，我将卡投射到他被元素精灵守卫的居所。那些精灵觉察到我的存在，化作火焰与阴影之形聚集四周，以难以名状的方式威胁着我。它们阻挠我，驱逐我...但我已看见——足够多的东西。\"\n\n师父停顿片刻，命我佩上一柄与他相似但年代较近的受祝魔法剑，此前他从不允许我佩戴。此时我已将所需饮食装入结实的渔网，便于肩扛手提。这渔网通常用于捕捉某种海生爬行动物，米奥尔·卢米维克斯能从其体内提炼出具有独特效用的毒液。\n\n直到我们锁好所有门户，冲进通向海边的蜿蜒暗巷时，师父才继续讲述：\n\n\"我闯入的瞬间，正有人离开萨坎德的房间。在黑色帷幕分开又合拢前，我短暂瞥见他；但我能再次认出他。那是个健壮的年轻胖子，少女般的脸上长着斜视的细眼，有着南方岛民特有的暗黄皮肤。除水手短裤及短靴外全身赤裸。\"\n\n\"萨坎德半侧身坐着，在喂养眼镜蛇油的四角邪灯下展开一张泛黄的纸莎草纸。灯焰如食尸鬼之眼般瞪视。但在恶魔们将我逐出前...我得以长久注视他肩头后方...那确实是奥姆沃的海图。它因年代久远而僵硬，沾染血渍与海水。尽管用如今少有人识的古文字书写，其标题、用途与名称仍清晰可辨。\"\n\n\"图上标注着佐西克大陆西岸及外海区域。米鲁安正西方的一座岛屿被标记为宝藏埋藏地。海图称其为蟹岛，但显然就是现今罕有人至的伊里伯斯岛，距此仅两日航程。方圆百里内除几处荒岩与小环礁外，南北皆无其他岛屿。\"\n\n米奥尔·卢米维克斯催促我加快动作，继续说道：\n\n\"我从迪代姆引发的昏迷中苏醒得太迟。寻常术士根本不可能醒来。\"\n\n\"我的使魔警告我萨坎德已离宅整时辰。他做好远行准备前往码头。但我们会追上他。我认为他会独自前往伊里伯斯，企图独占宝藏。他确实强大可怖，但其恶魔属陆行种，无法渡水。他已将半数法力与恶魔留在岸上。无需担忧结果。\"\n\n码头静寂无人，只有几个醉倒在劣质酒馆里的水手。弦月如弯刀高悬，我们解开缆绳推船离岸，师父掌舵，我则奋力划动宽桨。如此我们穿行在拥挤的船阵中，绕过单桅帆船、桨帆船、河驳、平底船与小帆船，驶出这座亘古港口。凝滞的空气几乎吹不动我们的三角帆，充斥着鱼腥味、香料与渔获的浊臭。无人向我们喊话；唯有守夜人在阴影笼罩的甲板上用异邦语言报时的呼喊。\n\n我们的小艇虽无篷盖，却由东方铁木所制，船首尖锐，龙骨深陷，舷墙高耸，即便在不应出现的风暴中也经受过考验。\n\n驶离港口时，从田野、果园与沙漠王国吹来的风在米鲁安上空增强。风势渐猛，船帆如龙翼般鼓起。泡沫沟壑在我们锋利的船首两侧高高扬起，我们追随着摩羯座向西航行。\n\n前方远处的海面在朦胧月光下，似有幻影般摇曳舞动的物体。或许是萨坎德的船...亦或他者。师父必定也看见了；但他只说：\n\n\"你现在可以睡了。\"\n\n于是学徒曼萨尔便躺下安眠，米奥尔·卢米维克斯继续掌舵，山羊座的星角与星蹄沉入海平线。\n\n当我醒来时，太阳已高悬船尾。风势依然强劲有利，推动我们以不减的速度向西航行。佐西克的海岸线早已消失不见。天空无云，海面无帆，唯余变幻消逝的浪沫在暗蓝的浩瀚卷轴上勾勒纹路。\n\n白昼流逝，没入静止的地平线；夜幕如天神遮蔽苍穹的紫帆降临，缝缀着星象与行星。黑夜亦逝，第二日破晓。\n\n这段时间里，师父始终未眠地掌着舵，双眼如海鹰般坚定地凝视西方；我对其耐力深感惊异。此刻他终于小憩，却仍保持直立握舵的姿势。仿佛他的眼睑后仍藏着警觉，手中的舵柄依旧稳如磐石。\n\n几小时后师父睁开双眼；却几乎未改变原有姿态。\n\n航程中他言语寥寥。我没有追问，知道他会在适当时机告知必要之事。但我满腹好奇；对萨坎德传闻中的死灵术也不无恐惧疑虑——那足以让任何新手胆寒。我无法揣测师父的思绪，只知必与幽暗秘术相关。\n\n【译文】\n第三次从航程中的昏睡里惊醒时，我听见主人在厉声呼喊。第三日破晓的微光中，一座岛屿如巨兽般耸立眼前——嶙峋的峭壁犬牙交错，向北延伸出数里格的海域。那轮廓活似面朝北方的怪物，高耸的犄角状岬角正如狮鹫的喙部浸在海水里。\n\n\"此乃伊里伯斯岛，\"主人告诉我，\"周遭海域暗流诡谲，凶险异常。这侧全无登陆之处，我们须绕行北部岬角。西侧峭壁间藏有海蚀洞，唯经此洞方能抵达隐秘小湾，珍宝便埋藏彼处。\"\n\n我们顶着妖风曲折北行，始终与岛屿保持三四箭之距。风势渐如恶魔吐息般狂暴，浪涛啃噬着裸露的怪岩，轰鸣声穿透风声传来。\"此岛无人居住，\"米奥尔·卢米维克斯道，\"水手与海鸟皆避之不及。传说远古海神曾降下诅咒，除深渊生物外万物禁入。那些洞窟里尽是蟹群与章鱼......或许还有更不可名状之物。\"\n\n航船如蛇行般艰难推进，恶灵般的阵风时而将我们逼向险岸。烈日攀至中天，将伊里伯斯狰狞的岩壁照得愈发荒芜。主人眼中似有隐忧闪过，却转瞬即逝。\n\n正午时分，我们终于绕过北部岬角。转向南行时，风浪竟如施了魔法般骤然平息。船帆垂挂在镜面般的海面上，连倒影都凝固成永恒。纵使奋力划桨，船速仍迟缓得诡异。\n\n岩壁上零星点缀着丧服色的植被，高处竟散落着古代船只的残骸，绝非自然之力所能及。\"划近些，\"主人命令道，\"通往秘湾的海蚀洞就在眼前。\"\n\n平静的海面突然沸腾，船身如被海怪拖拽般冲向峭壁。在无可抗拒的激流中，我们如落叶般徒劳挣扎。千钧一发之际，岩壁上现出低矮的拱形洞口，船只以骇人速度被吸入其中。\n\n\"就是这里！\"主人高喊，\"但妖潮已淹没入口！\"\n\n桅杆折断的脆响中，我们坠入黑暗深渊。当我挣扎着从浸水的船骸里爬出时，一双臂膀正将我拖向光明。\n\n咳出肺中咸水后，我发现身处半月形小湾。翡翠般的海面映着我们方才穿越的洞口，对岸滩涂上搁浅着猩红帆船。两具半浸在水中的躯体上，覆盖着不断蠕动的黄褐色物质——竟是无数螃蟹正撕扯血肉，却将肉块运往岩石后方。\n\n\"这些螃蟹竟不进食，\"主人低语，\"只是搬运尸块。\"我们追踪蟹群绕过岩堆，发现它们进出之处赫然是隐藏的洞窟入口。\n\n\"进来！\"某个如墓穴回音般的嗓音突然轰鸣。主人以眼神示警，我们握紧巫刃，踏入了那座洞窟。\n\n此处穹顶高耸，空间幽邃难测。一道巨大的裂隙横贯洞顶，此刻正将正午的阳光化作金色光柱斜斜倾泻而下，照亮洞窟前庭，为远处幽暗中林立的钟乳石与石笋镀上森然寒芒。侧畔有一方水潭，源自黑暗中某处泉眼渗出的涓涓细流。\n\n萨坎德背靠一具青铜古箱，半倚半卧地憩息在光柱中央。他黝黑如乌木的魁梧身躯虽显臃肿却肌肉虬结，除了一串每颗都如千鸟蛋大小的红宝石项链垂在颈间外全身赤裸。那条深红色纱笼已残破不堪，露出他伸展在碎石间的双腿——右腿膝盖以下显然已折断，粗糙地绑着浮木夹板与从纱笼撕下的布条。\n\n他身旁铺展着青金石色丝绸斗篷，上面散落着铭刻符文的宝石与护符、金币与镶满珠宝的祭器，在堆积如山的羊皮卷与纸莎草间闪烁微光。一本黑铁封面的典籍摊开着，仿佛刚刚搁置，内页用古老颜料绘制的插图仍泛着磷火般的幽光。\n\n典籍旁触手可及之处，堆着血淋淋的生肉碎块。成队的螃蟹正越过斗篷、金币与卷轴爬来，每只都将撕扯下的肉块添到肉堆上，而后加入离去的队列。\n\n我完全相信关于萨坎德血统的传闻。他显然完全继承了母亲的容貌：无论是发肤还是五官，都与旅行者画卷中纳阿特族的食人蛮族如出一辙。他莫测高深地抱臂而立，右手食指上一枚硕大的祖母绿戒指正泛着幽光。\n\n\"我早知你们会跟来，\"他开口道，\"就像我料定那个窃贼与其同伙会尾随一样。你们都妄图杀我夺宝。不错，我确实受了伤——当我俯身检视宝箱时，洞顶坠落的碎石砸断了我的腿。在骨骼愈合前，我只能在此静养。不过...\"他抚过身旁的弯刀与法杖，\"我的武装很充分...仆从与守卫也很称职。\"\n\n\"我们为宝藏而来，\"米奥尔·卢米维克斯直截了当，\"我原想与你公平决斗，巫师对巫师，只让我的学徒曼萨尔与伊里伯斯的岩石见证。\"\n\n\"呵，你的学徒还带着仪式匕首。不过无所谓了。米奥尔·卢米维克斯，我将啖食你的肝脏，汲取你全部的巫术力量。\"\n\n师父对此置若罔闻。\"你又施了什么邪法？\"他厉声质问，指向仍在肉堆上投放碎块的蟹群。\n\n萨坎德举起戴着祖母绿戒指的右手。此刻我们才看清，那枚海怪造型的戒指正用触须紧紧缠绕着球状宝石。\"这是我从宝藏中发现的，\"他炫耀道，\"它与记载其用途的卷轴一同封存在未知金属的圆筒中。此乃海神巴萨坦的玺戒。长久凝视宝石者能随心窥见远方景象，佩戴者只需凌空画符便可操纵海流与风浪，统御海洋生灵。\"\n\n随着他的话语，那枚绿宝石诡异地明灭闪烁，恍若通向深海奥秘的微缩窗口。我竟恍惚忘却身处险境——宝石在我视野中不断膨胀，吞没了萨坎德漆黑的手指，其莹莹绿光深处似有暗潮翻涌，隐约浮现出鳍与触须的阴影。\n\n\"当心，曼萨尔，\"师父的低语将我惊醒，\"我们正面对可怖邪术，必须保持神智清明。别再看那宝石。\"\n\n我勉强移开视线。幻象消退后，萨坎德鲨鱼般的利齿正咧出讥讽的笑容。他将戴着玺戒的巨手探入身后宝箱，抓出五彩斑斓的宝石任其从指间流泻：\"我比你们早到伊里伯斯数小时。唯有在退潮时乘无桅之舟才能安全进入外洞...或许你们已猜到我接下来要说的。反正这些秘密很快会随你们葬身于此。\"\n\n\"借助戒指，我虽断腿仍能监视伊里伯斯海域。我操纵洋流将窃贼的小船卷入水洞沉没，又命蟹群将他们拖入深海溺毙，待潮水把尸体冲上岸...那该死的窃贼！我重金购回他偷走的海图，这蠢货却读不懂...\"\n\n\"后来我用逆风与无风带拖延你们，再用同样手法诱捕。不过，我特意为你们准备了比溺毙更精彩的结局。\"\n\n死灵法师的声音在洞窟中回荡出毛骨悚然的余韵。我们仿佛站在无底深渊边缘，黑暗中唯有萨坎德的双目与戒指闪着幽光。\n\n师父冷冽的嘲讽打破了咒缚：\"萨坎德，你漏说了一种巫术。\"\n\n萨坎德的笑声如惊涛拍岸：\"我继承母族习俗，借海神戒指驱使蟹群供奉所需之物。\"他抬手画出符咒，戒指顿时如流星轮转。静止的蟹群突然如潮水涌来，刀锋般的螯钳疯狂攻击我们脚踝。我挥动匕首抵抗，却被爬上斗篷的蟹群拖倒。\n\n倒地瞬间，我看见师父甩开斗篷，在蟹群攀上膝盖时以诡异弧线掷出匕首。寒光如轮斩过萨坎德扬起的右腕，戴着戒指的断掌如流星坠地。\n\n鲜血从断腕喷涌而出时，萨坎德仍保持着施法姿势。待他手臂垂落，血溪便在珍宝堆间蔓延，染红了蟹群堆积的肉块。仿佛收到新指令，蟹群突然调转方向涌向萨坎德，瞬间覆盖了他的躯体。他独臂撕扯着蟹群，诅咒声在洞窟中激起无数回声。但蟹群如恶魔附体般疯狂攻击，直至那具被活体裹尸布包裹的身躯停止挣扎。唯有绑着夹板的断腿与戴着巴萨坦戒指的断掌未被蟹群触碰。\n\n\"呸！\"师父啐道，\"他虽将恶魔留在故乡，却在此地豢养了新宠...该去晒晒太阳了。曼萨尔，我笨手笨脚的学徒，去海滩用浮木生堆火。把火烧得像地狱熔炉般通红，好烤些海蟹当晚餐——记住只挑刚从海里爬出来的。\""

        "content": "\n\nIn Umbri, City of the Delta, the lights blazed with a garish brilliance after the setting of that sun which was now a coal-red decadent star, grown old beyond chronicle, beyond legend. Most brilliant, most garish of all were the lights that illumed the house of the ageing poet Famurza, whose Anacreontic songs had brought him the riches that he disbursed in orgies for his friends and sycophants. Here, in porticoes, halls and chambers the cressets were thick as stars in a cloudless fault. It seemed that Famurza wished to dissipate all shadows, except those in arrased alcoves set apart for the fitful amours of his guests.\n\nFor the kindling of such amours there were wines, cordials, aphrodisiacs. There were meats and fruits that swelled the flaccid pulses. There were strange exotic drugs that amused and prolonged pleasure. There were curious statuettes in half-veiled niches; and wall panels painted with bestial loves, or loves human or superhuman. There were hired singers of all sexes, who sang ditties diversely erotic; and dancers whose contortions were calculated to restore the outworn sense when all else had failed.\n\nBut to all such incitants Valzain, pupil of Famurza, and renowned both as poet and voluptuary, was insensible.\n\nWith indifference turning toward disgust, a half-emptied cup in his hand, he watched from a corner the gala throng that eddied past him, and averted his eyes involuntarily from certain couples who were too shameless or drunken to seek the shadows of privacy for their dalliance. A sudden satiety had claimed him. He felt himself strangely withdrawn from the morass of wine and flesh into which, not long before, he had still plunged with delight. He seemed as one who stands on an alien shore, beyond waters of deepening separation.\n\n\"What ails you, Valzain? Has a vampire sucked your blood?\" It was Famurza, flushed. gray-haired, slightly corpulent, who stood at his elbow. Laying an affectionate hand on Valzain's shoulder, he hoisted aloft with the other that fescenninely graven quart goblet from which he was wont to drink onIy wine, eschewing the drugged and violent liquors often preferred by the sybarites of Umbri\n\n\"Is it billiousness? Or unrequited love? We have cures here for both. You have only to name your medicine\"\n\n\"There is no medicine for what ails me,\" countered Valzain. \"As for love, I have ceased to care whether it be requited or unrequited. I can taste only the dregs in every cup. And tedium lurks at the middle of all kisses\"\n\n\"Truly, yours is a melancholy case.\" There was concern in Famurza's voice. \"I have been reading some of your late verses. You write only of tombs and yew trees, of maggots and phantoms and disembodied love. Such stuff gives me the colic, I need at least a half-gallon of honest vine juice after each poem.\"\n\n\"Though I did not know it till lately,\" admitted Valzain, \"there is in me a curiosity toward the unseen, a longing for things beyond the material world.\"\n\nFamurza shook his head commiserately. \"Though I have attained to more than twice your years, I am still content with what I see and hear and touch. Good juicy meat, women, wine, the songs of full-throated singers, are enough for me.\"\n\n\"In the drums of slumber,\" mused Valzain. \"I have clasped succubi who were more than flesh, have known delights too keen for the waking body to sustain. Do such dreams have any source, outside the earthborn brain itself? I would give much to find that source, if it exists. In the meanwhile there is nothing for me but despair.\"\n\n\"So young — and yet so exhausted! Well, if you're tired of women, and want phantoms instead, I might venture a suggestion. Do you know the old necropolis, lying midway between Umbri and Psiom — a matter of perhaps three miles from here? The goatherds say that a lamia haunts it — the spirit of the princess Morthylla, who died several centuries ago and was interred in a mausoleum that still stands, overtowering the lesser tombs. Why not go forth tonight and visit the necropolis? It should suit your mood better than my house. And perhaps Morthylla will appear to you. But don't blame me if you don't return at all. After all those years the lamia is still avid for human lovers; and she might well take a fancy to you.\"\n\n\"Of course, I know the place,\" said Valzain... \"But I think you are jesting.\"\n\nFamurza shrugged his shoulders and moved on amid the revelers. A laughing dancer, blonde-limbed and lissom, came up to Valzain and threw a noose of plaited flowers about his neck, claiming him as her captive. He broke the noose gently, and gave the girl a tepid kiss that caused her to make wry faces. Unobtrusively but quickly, before others of the merrymakers could try to entice him, he left the house of Famurza.\n\nWithout impulses, other than that of an urgent desire for solitude, he turned his steps toward the suburbs, avoiding the neighborhood of taverns and lupanars, where the populace thronged. Music, laughter, snatches of songs, followed him from lighted mansions where symposia were held nightly by the city's richer denizens. But he met few roisters on the streets: it was too late for the gathering, too early for the dispersal, of guests at such symposia.\n\nNow the lights thinned out, with ever-widening intervals between, and the streets grew shadowy with that ancient night which pressed about Umbri, and would wholly quench its defiant galaxies of lamp-bright window with the darkening of Zothique's senescent sun. Of such things, and of death's encircling mystery, were the musings of Valzain as he plunged into the outer darkness that he found grateful to his glare-wearied eyes.\n\nGrateful too was the silence of the field-bordered road that he pursued for awhile without realizing its direction. Then, at some landmark familiar despite the gloom, it came to him that the road was the one which ran from Umbri to Psiom, that sister city of the Delta; the road beside whose middle meanderings was situated the long-disused necropolis to which Famurza had ironically directed him.\n\nTruly, he thought, the earthly-minded Famurza had somehow plumbed the need that lay at the bottom of his disenchantment with all sensory pleasures. It would be good to visit, to sojourn for an hour or so, in that city whose people had long passed beyond the lusts of mortality, beyond satiety and disillusion.\n\nA moon, swelling from the crescent toward the half, arose behind him as he reached the foot of the lowmounded hill on which the cemetery lay. He left the paved road, and began to ascend the slope, half-covered with stunted gorse, at whose summit the glimmering marbles were discernible. It was without path, other than the broken trails made by goats and their herders. Dim, lengthened and attenuate, his shadow went before him, like a ghostly guide. In his fantasy it seemed to him that he climbed the gently sloping bosom of a giantess, studded afar with pale gems that were tombstones and mausoleuns. He caught himself wondering, amid this poetic whimsy, whether the giantess was dead, or merely slept.\n\nGaining the flat expansive ground of the summit, where dwarfish dying yews disputed with leafless briars the intervals of slabs blotched with lichen, he recalled the tale that Famurza had mentioned, anent the lamia who was said to haunt the necropolis. Famurza, he knew well, was no believer in such legendry, and had meant only to mock his funereal mood. Yet, as a poet will, he began to play with the fancy of some presence, immortal, lovely and evil, that dwelt amid the antique marbles and would respond to the evocation of one who, without positive belief, had longed vainly for visions from beyond mortality.\n\nThrough headstone aisles of moon-touched solitude, he came to a lofty mausoleum, still standing with few signs of ruin at the cemetery's center. Beneath it, he had been told, were extensive vaults housing the mummies of an extinct royal family that had ruled over the twin cities Umbri and Psiom in former centuries. The princess Morthylla had belonged to this family.\n\nTo his startlement a woman, or what appeared to be such, was sitting on a fallen shaft beside the mausoleum. He could not see her distinctly; the tomb's shadow still enveloped her from the shoulders downward. The face alone, glimmering wanly, was lifted to the rising moon Its profile was such as he had seen on antique coins.\n\n\"Who are you?\" he asked, with a curiosity that over powered his courtesy.\n\n\"I am the lamia Morthylla,\" she replied, in a voice that left behind it a faint and elusive vibration like that of some briefly sounded harp. \"Beware me — for my kisses are forbidden to those who would remain numbered among the living.\"\n\nValzain was startled by this answer that echoed his fantasies. Yet reason told him that the apparition was no spirit of the tombs but a living woman who knew the legend of Morthylla and wished to amuse herself by teasing him. And yet what woman would venture alone and at night to a place so desolate and eerie?\n\nMost credibly, she was a wanton who had come out to keep a rendezvous amid the tombs. There were, he knew, certain perverse debauchees who required sepulchral surroundings and furnishings for the titillation of their desires.\n\n\"Perhaps you are waiting for some one,\" he suggested. \"I do not wish to intrude, if such is the case.\"\n\n\"I wait only for him who is destined to come. And I have waited long, having had no lover for two hundred years. Remain, if you wish: there is no one to fear but me.\"\n\nDespite the rational surmises he had formed, there crept along Valzain's spine the thrill of one who, without fully believing, suspects the presence of a thing beyond nature... Yet surely it was all a game — a game that he too could play for the beguilement of his ennui.\n\n\"I came here hoping to meet you,\" he declared.. \"I am weary of mortal women, tired of every pleasure — tired even of poetry.\"\n\n\"I, too, am bored,\" she said, simply.\n\nThe moon had climbed higher, shining on the dress of antique mode that the woman wore. It was cut closely at waist and hips and bosom, with voluminous downward folds. Valzain had seen such costumes only in old drawings. The princess Morthylla, dead for three centuries, might well have worn a similar dress.\n\nWhoever she might be, he thought, the woman was strangely beautiful, with a touch of quaintness in the heavily coiled hair whose color he could not decide in the moonlight. There was a sweetness about her mouth, a shadow of fatigue. or sadness beneath her eyes. At the right corner of her lips he discerned a small mole.\n\nValzain's meeting with the self-named Morthylla was repeated nightly while the moon swelled like the rounding breast of a titaness and fell away once more to hollowness and senescence. Always she awaited him by the same mausoleum which, she declared, was her dwelling place. And always she dismissed him when the east turned ashen with dawn, saying that she was a creature of the night.\n\nSkeptical at first, he thought of her as a person with macabre leanings and fantasies akin to his own, with whom he was carrying on a flirtation of singular charm. Yet about her he could find no hint of the worldliness that he suspected: no seeming knowledge of present things, but a weird familiarity with the past and the lamia's legend. More and more she seemed a nocturnal being, intimate only with shadow and solitude.\n\nHer eyes, her lips, appeared to withhold secrets forgot- ten and forbidden. In her vague, ambiguous answers to his questions, he read meanings that thrilled him with hope and fear.\n\n\"I have dreamed of life,\" she told him cryptically. \"And I have dreamed also of death. Now, perhaps there is another dream — into which you have entered.\"\n\n\"I, too, would dream,\" said Valzain.\n\nNight after night his disgust and weariness sloughed away from him, in a fascination fed by the spectral milieu, the environing silence of the dead, his withdrawal and separation from the carnal, garish city. By degrees, by alternations of unbelief and belief, he came to accept her as the actual lamia. The hunger that he sensed in her, could be only the lamia's hunger; her beauty that of a being no longer human. It was like a dreamer's acceptance of things fantastic elsewhere than in sleep.\n\nTogether with his belief, there grew his love for her. The desires he had thought dead revived within him, wilder, more importunate.\n\nShe seemed to love him in return. Yet she betrayed no sign of the lamia's legendary nature, eluding his embrace, refusing him the kisses for which he begged.\n\n\"Sometime, perhaps,\" she conceded. \"But first you must know me for what I am, must love me without illusion.'\n\n\"Kill me with your lips, devour me as you are said to have devoured other lovers,\" beseeched Valzain.\n\n\"Can you not wait?\" her smile was sweet — and tantalizing. \"I do not wish your death so soon, for I love you too well. Is it not sweet to keep your tryst among the sepulchres? Have I not beguiled you from your boredom? Must you end it all?\"\n\nThe next night he besought her again, imploring with all his ardor and eloquence the denied consummation.\n\nShe mocked him: \"Perhaps I am merely a bodiless phantom, a spirit without substance. Perhaps you have dreamed me. Would you risk an awakening from the dream?\"\n\nValzain stepped toward her, stretching out his arms in a passionate gesture. She drew back, saying:\n\n\"What if I should turn to ashes and moonlight at your touch? You would regret then your rash insistence.\"\n\n\"You are the immortal lamia,\" avowed Valzain. \"My senses tell me that you are no phantom, no disembodied spirit. But for me you have turned all else to shadow.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am real enough in my fashion,\" she granted, laughing softly. Then suddenly she leaned toward him and her lips touched his throat. He felt their moist warmth a moment — and felt the sharp sting of her teeth that barely pierced his skin, withdrawing instantly. Before he could clasp her she eluded him again.\n\n\"It is the only kiss permitted to us at present,\" she cried, and fled swiftly with soundless footfalls among the gleams and shadows of the sepulchres.\n\nOn the following afternoon a matter of urgent and unwelcome business called Valzain to the neighboring city of Psiom: a brief journey, but one that he seldom took.\n\nHe passed the ancient necropolis, longing for that nocturnal hour when he could hasten once more to a meeting with Morthylla. Her poignant kiss, which had drawn a few drops of blood, had left him greatly fevered and distraught. He, like that place of tombs, was haunted; and the haunting went with him into Psiom.\n\nHe had finished his business, the borrowing of a sum of money from a usurer. Standing at the usurer's door, with that slightly obnoxious but necessary person beside him, he saw a woman passing on the street.\n\nHer features, though not her dress, were those of Morthylla; and there was even the same tiny mole at one corner of her mouth. No phantom of the cemetery could have startled or dismayed him more profoundly.\n\n\"Who is that woman? he asked the moneylender. \"Do you know her?\"\n\n\"Her name is Beldith. She is well-known in Psiom, being rich in her own right and having had numerous lovers. I've had a little business with her, though she owes me nothing at present. Should you care to meet her? I can easily introduce you.\"\n\n\"Yes, I should like to meet her,\" agreed Valzain. \"She looks strangely like someone that I knew a long time ago.\n\nThe usurer peered slyly at the poet. \"She might not make too easy a conquest. It is said of late that she has withdrawn herself from the pleasures of the city. Some have seen her going out at night toward the old necropolis, or returning from it in the early dawn. Strange tastes, I'd say, for one who is little more than a harlot. But perhaps she goes out to meet some eccentric lover.\"\n\n\"Direct me to her house,\" Valzain requested. \"I shall not need you to introduce me.\"\n\n\"As you like.\" The moneylender shrugged, looking a little disappointed. \"It's not far, anyway.\"\n\nValzain found the house quickly. The woman Beldith was alone. She meet him with a wistful and troubled smile that left no doubt of her identity.\n\n\"I perceive that you have learned the truth,\" she said \"I had meant to tell you soon, for the deception could not have gone on much longer. Will you not forgive me?\"\n\n\"I forgive you,\" returned Valzain sadly. \"But why did you deceive me?\"\n\n\"Because you desired it. A woman tries to please the man whom she loves; and in all love there is more or less deception.\n\n\"Like you, Valzain, I had grown tired of pleasure. And I sought the solitude of the necropolis, so remote from carnal things. You too came, seeking solitude and peace -- or some unearthly specter. I recognized you at once. And I had read your poems. Knowing Morthylla's legend, I sought to play a game with you. Playing it, I grew to love you... Valzain, you loved me as the lamia. Can you not now love me for myself?\"\n\n\"It cannot be,\" averred the poet. \"I fear to repeat the disappointment I have found in other women. Yet at least I am grateful for the hours you gave me. They were the best I have known — even though I have loved something that did not, and could not, exist. Farewell, Morthylla. Farewell, Beldith.\"\n\nWhen he had gone, Beldith stretched herself face downward among the cushions of her couch. She wept a little; and the tears made a dampness that quickly dried. Later she arose briskly enough and went about her household business.\n\n'After a time she returned to the loves and revelries of Psiom. Perhaps, in the end, she found such peace as may be given to those who have grown too old for pleasure.\n\nBut for Valzain there was no peace, no balm for this last and most bitter of disillusionments. Nor could he return to the carnalities of his former life. So it was that he finally slew himself, stabbing his throat to its deepest vein with a keen knife in the same spot which the false lamia's teeth had bitten, drawing a little blood.\n\nAfter his death, he forgot that he had died; forgot the immediate past with all its happenings and circumstances.\n\nFollowing his talk with Famurza, he had gone forth from Famurza's house and from the city of Umbri and had taken the road that passed the abandoned cemetery. Seized by an impulse to visit it, he had climbed the slope toward the marbles under a swelling moon that rose behind him.\n\n\"I am the lamia Morthylla,\" she replied.",
        "content_cn": "在三角洲的暗影之城乌姆布里，当那轮已沦为暗红衰败星辰的夕阳沉落后，刺目的灯火便以令人眩晕的辉煌燃起。其中最耀目、最艳俗的光芒，正照耀着老诗人法穆尔扎的宅邸——这位诗人的阿那克里翁式颂歌为他积累了挥霍于酒池肉林的财富。门廊、厅堂与内室里，火炬密集如无云夜空的星群，仿佛法穆尔扎执意要驱散所有阴影，唯余那些悬挂壁毯的幽暗壁龛，专供宾客们纵情声色。\n\n为点燃情欲之火，这里备有醇酒、甘露与春药。令人血脉偾张的珍馐异果，延长欢愉的诡谲药剂，半掩壁龛中姿态狎昵的雕像，绘满凡人、野兽与超自然生灵交媾场景的镶板壁画。更有雇佣的歌者吟唱着露骨艳曲，舞者以精心设计的扭曲姿态刺激着麻木的感官。\n\n然而法穆尔扎的门徒、兼具诗名与浪子之誉的瓦尔赞，对这一切诱惑无动于衷。\n\n他手握半空酒杯，从角落里漠然注视着川流不息的欢宴人群，当瞥见某些不知羞耻或烂醉如泥的男女时，不由嫌恶地移开视线。一种突如其来的餍足感攫住了他。他感觉自己正奇异地从不久前还沉溺其中的酒色泥沼中抽离，宛如立于陌生彼岸，隔着愈发幽深的冥河之水。\n\n\"怎么了瓦尔赞？被吸血鬼吸干了血吗？\"面色潮红的法穆尔扎出现在他身侧。这位灰发微胖的诗人将慈爱的手搭在弟子肩上，另一只手高举着他惯用的雕花石英酒杯——他向来只饮纯酿，不屑于乌姆布里纵欲者们钟情的药酒。\n\n\"是胆汁淤积？还是相思成疾？我们这儿都有解药。只管开口便是。\"\n\n\"我的病症无药可医，\"瓦尔赞回应道，\"至于情爱，我已不在乎是否得到回应。每杯美酒尝来尽是残渣，所有亲吻背后都潜伏着厌倦。\"\n\n\"看来你病得不轻。\"法穆尔扎声音里透着关切，\"我读过你近期的诗作。满篇尽是墓冢、紫杉、蛆虫、幽魂与虚无之爱。这些玩意儿让我肠胃绞痛，每读一首就得灌下半加仑纯酒。\"\n\n\"直到最近我才意识到，\"瓦尔赞坦言，\"我体内涌动着对不可见之物的好奇，渴望着超脱物质世界的存在。\"\n\n法穆尔扎怜悯地摇头：\"即便活过你两倍岁月，我仍满足于所见所触之物——鲜嫩多汁的肉排、女人、美酒与歌者嘹亮的嗓音，于我足矣。\"\n\n\"在睡梦的鼓点里，\"瓦尔赞低语，\"我曾拥抱过超越肉体的魅魔，体验过清醒之躯无法承受的极乐。这些梦境难道仅源自凡俗大脑？若能找到其源头，我愿付出任何代价。而眼下，唯有绝望与我相伴。\"\n\n\"如此年轻却已精疲力竭！既然厌倦了活色生香，何不追寻幽灵？我有个建议——可知位于乌姆布里与普西奥姆之间的古墓场？距此约三英里。牧羊人说那里游荡着拉弥亚女妖，正是几个世纪前葬于陵墓的莫西拉公主。今夜何不去探访？那地方比我的宅子更配你心境。说不定莫西拉会显灵呢——但若一去不返可别怪我。这女妖两百年来仍渴求凡间情人，或许会看上你。\"\n\n\"那地方我自然知道，\"瓦尔赞说，\"但你必是在说笑。\"\n\n法穆尔扎耸耸肩没入人群。一位肢体柔韧的金发舞女将花环套上瓦尔赞脖颈，却被他轻轻挣脱。他敷衍的亲吻惹得少女撇嘴。趁其他狂欢者尚未纠缠，他悄然离开了宅邸。\n\n怀着对独处的迫切渴望，他避开酒肆娼馆聚集的街巷向郊外走去。富商宅邸飘出的乐曲与欢笑尾随其后，但街上几无行人——此刻既非聚会时分，亦未到散场时辰。\n\n灯火渐稀，古老的夜色裹挟着乌姆布里，终将吞噬这座抗拒黑暗的灯火之城。瓦尔赞沉思着死亡的重重谜团，步入令他眩目之眼倍感舒适的黑暗。\n\n他沿着田野间的道路前行，蓦然惊觉这正是通往普西奥姆的古道——法穆尔扎戏言所指的墓园就在中途。他忽然醒悟：世俗的法穆尔扎竟洞悉了他对感官享乐幻灭的根源。造访那座居民早已超脱凡俗欲望的亡者之城，或许正是解药。\n\n当他抵达墓园所在的山丘时，新月已渐盈。他离开石径攀爬长满荆棘的斜坡，鬼魅般的修长影子在前引路。恍惚间，他仿佛正攀爬一位镶嵌着苍白宝石（那些墓碑与陵寝）的女巨人躯体，不禁遐想她是长眠抑或已死。\n\n登上遍布苔藓石碑的丘顶，法穆尔扎提及的拉弥亚传说浮现脑海。明知老师不信鬼神，他仍开始幻想某种永恒、美丽而邪恶的存在盘踞于此，回应着渴求超凡幻象之人的召唤。\n\n穿过月光浸染的碑林，他来到墓园中央保存完好的宏伟陵寝。传说其下地宫存放着曾统治双子城的王族木乃伊，莫西拉公主正是其中一员。\n\n令他惊愕的是，陵墓旁倒卧的石柱上竟坐着个女子。墓影笼罩着她腰部以下，唯有苍白的面孔仰对月亮，轮廓宛如古钱币上的浮雕。\n\n\"何人？\"他失礼地脱口而出。\n\n\"我是拉弥亚莫西拉，\"她的声音如竖琴余韵般飘渺，\"当心——我的亲吻会剥夺生者的资格。\"\n\n这回应令瓦尔赞战栗，理智却告诉他：这不过是知晓传说的活人戏弄。但怎会有女子深夜独临此等荒芜之地？最可能是来墓地幽会的放荡女子——某些堕落者确需坟茔助兴。\n\n\"或许你在等人？那我便不打扰了。\"\n\n\"我只等候命定之人。两百年来未有眷侣，已等待太久。若愿意便留下吧，此地除我无可惧者。\"\n\n尽管心存理性推测，瓦尔赞仍脊背发凉——这是半信半疑者遭遇超自然存在时的战栗。但转念一想，这何尝不是排遣无聊的游戏？\n\n\"我来此正是为遇见你，\"他宣称，\"我已厌倦凡俗女子，厌倦一切享乐——甚至厌倦诗歌。\"\n\n\"我也厌倦了。\"她淡淡说道。\n\n月光攀得更高了，映照着女子身上那袭古式长裙。剪裁极尽贴合腰肢、臀线与胸脯的曲线，下摆却如瀑布般垂坠出繁复褶皱。瓦尔赞只在古籍插画中见过这般装束——三百年前死去的莫西拉公主，想必就穿着类似裙裎。\n\n无论她是谁，瓦尔赞心想，这女子美得诡异。月光下辨不清颜色的发髻盘得极紧，透着几分古意。唇畔噙着蜜糖般的笑意，眼睑下却浮着倦影，抑或是哀戚。他注意到她右唇角有颗小痣。\n\n自称莫西拉的女人夜夜与瓦尔赞相会，直到月轮如泰坦女神丰盈的胸脯般涨满，又衰颓成空洞的残钩。她总在那座自称居所的石棺旁等候，又在东方泛起死灰般的晨光时遣他离去，声称自己属于黑夜。\n\n起初瓦尔赞疑心她只是个与自己同样嗜好阴森幻想的女子，这场充满奇异魅力的调情令他着迷。然而她身上毫无世俗气息，对当代事物显得陌生，却对往昔岁月与蛇妖传说异常熟稔。她愈发像个夜行生物，只与阴影和孤寂为伴。\n\n她的眼眸与双唇仿佛封存着被禁忌遗忘的秘密。那些含糊其辞的回答里，瓦尔赞读出了令他战栗的希望与恐惧。\n\n\"我曾梦见生，\"她低语如谜，\"亦曾梦见死。而今或许有第三场梦——而你闯了进来。\"\n\n\"我亦愿入梦。\"瓦尔赞答道。\n\n夜复一夜，在幽灵般的环境与死者环绕的静默中，在对血肉横陈的浮华都市的疏离里，他的厌恶与倦怠如蛇蜕般剥落。怀疑与确信交替滋长，他逐渐接受她就是真正的蛇妖。她眼底的饥渴只能是蛇妖的饥渴，她的美早已不属于人类。这就像梦游者清醒时接受了梦境中的荒诞。\n\n信仰催生爱意。他以为死去的欲望复苏得愈发狂乱。\n\n她似乎也爱着他，却始终回避拥抱，拒绝他乞求的亲吻，毫无传说中蛇妖的秉性。\n\n\"或许某天，\"她让步道，\"但你先要看清我的本质，爱真实的我。\"\n\n\"用你的唇杀死我，像传说中吞噬其他情人那样吞噬我。\"瓦尔赞哀求。\n\n\"等不得么？\"她的微笑甜美而残忍，\"我舍不得你早死。在墓园幽会不美妙么？我未将你从厌倦中解救么？何必急于终结？\"\n\n次日夜里他再度恳求，用尽炽热言辞。\n\n她嘲弄道：\"或许我只是无实体的幽魂，或许你正在梦中。敢冒险醒来么？\"\n\n瓦尔赞张开双臂逼近。她退后警告：\"若我在你触碰时化作月光与灰烬呢？\"\n\n\"你是不死的蛇妖，\"他断言，\"我的感官确认你绝非幻影。但你已令万物于我皆成虚妄。\"\n\n\"以我的方式存在，倒也算真实。\"她轻笑。忽然倾身，双唇贴上他咽喉。他先感到湿润暖意，继而是利齿刺破皮肤的锐痛——瞬息即逝。未及拥抱，她已闪入碑林阴影。\n\n\"眼下只准如此亲吻。\"她飘渺的声音传来。\n\n次日下午，瓦尔赞被迫前往邻近的普西奥姆城办事。途经古墓园时，他渴望着夜色降临后与莫西拉的相会。那个渗血的吻令他终日焦灼恍惚。他如墓园般被萦绕，这萦随他进了普西奥姆城。\n\n当他在放债人门前完成借款时，忽见街上有位女子走过。\n\n那分明是莫西拉的容颜——连唇边小痣都分毫不差，只是装束迥异。没有比墓园幽灵现身闹市更骇人的事了。\n\n\"她叫贝尔蒂丝，\"放债人眯眼道，\"普西奥姆的名媛，近来却夜夜往古墓园跑。虽说是个娼妇，这癖好也够古怪。\"\n\n\"带我去她住处，\"瓦尔赞说，\"不必引见。\"\n\n\"随你便罢。\"放债人耸了耸肩，神色略显失望，\"反正路也不远。\"\n\n瓦尔赞很快找到了那座宅邸。名为贝尔蒂丝的女人独居于此。她以忧郁而困扰的微笑迎接他，那神情无疑昭示了她的真实身份。\n\n\"看来你已得知真相，\"她说道，\"我本打算不久后向你坦白，这欺瞒终究无法长久。你能原谅我么？\"\n\n\"我原谅你，\"瓦尔赞哀伤地回应，\"可为何要欺骗我？\"\n\n\"因这是你所愿。女人总想取悦心爱之人；而世间情爱，多少都带着欺瞒。\"\n\n\"与你一样，瓦尔赞，我也早已厌倦欢愉。于是寻求远离尘世享乐的墓园独居。而你同样来此寻觅孤寂与安宁——或是某个不属于人世的幽魂。我一眼就认出了你。读过你的诗篇，知晓莫西拉的传说后，我便想与你玩这场游戏。游戏之中，我却爱上了你……瓦尔赞，你爱的是身为蛇妖的我。如今难道不能爱我本身么？\"\n\n\"不可能了，\"诗人断言，\"我害怕重蹈与其他女子交往时的失望。但至少感激你给予我的时光。那是我所知最美好的时刻——即便我所爱的，是并不存在也不可能存在的幻影。永别了，莫西拉。永别了，贝尔蒂丝。\"\n\n待他离去，贝尔蒂丝俯身埋入长榻的软枕间。她轻声啜泣，泪痕很快干涸。稍后她便利落地起身，料理起家务来。\n\n此后某日，她重返普西奥姆的欢场爱欲。或许最终，她寻得了那些倦于享乐之人所能获得的安宁。\n\n但对瓦尔赞而言，这最后一次也是最苦涩的幻灭，既无安宁亦无慰藉。他也无法回归从前纵欲的生活。最终他选择自戕，用利刃刺入曾被伪蛇妖咬破的颈脉——彼时那伤口只渗出些许血珠。\n\n死后，他忘却了自己已死；忘却了近期所有际遇与经历。\n\n与法穆尔扎谈罢，他离开那宅邸，离开乌姆布里城，踏上了途经荒废墓园的道路。受某种冲动驱使，他在渐盈的月轮下攀爬斜坡，走向那些大理石墓碑。\n\n\"我是蛇妖莫西拉，\"她答道。"

        "content": "\n\nMalygris the magician sat in the topmost room of his tower that was builded on a conicall hill above the heart of Susran, capital of Poseidonis. Wrought of a dark stone mined from deep in the earth, perdurable and hard as the fabled adamant, this tower loomed above all others, and flung its shadow far on the roofs and domes of the city, even as the sinister power of Malygris had thrown its darkness on the minds of men.\n\nNow Malygris was old, and all the baleful might of his enchantments, all the dreadful or curious demons under his control, all the fear that he had wrought in the hearts of kings and prelates, were no longer enough to assuage the black ennui of his days. In his chair that was fashioned from the ivory of mastodons, inset with terrible cryptic runes of red tourmalines and azure crystals, he stared moodily through the one lozenge-shaped window of fulvous glass. His white eyebrows were contracted to a single line on the umber parchment of his face, and beneath them his eyes were cold and green as the ice of ancient floes; his beard, half white, half of a black with glaucous gleams, fell nearly to his knees and hid many of the writhing serpentine characters inscribed in woven silver athwart the bosom of his violet robe. About him were scattered all the appurtenances of his art; the skulls of men and monsters; phials filled with black or amber liquids, whose sacrilegious use was known to none but himself; little drums of vulture-skin, and crotali made from the bones and teeth of the cockodrill, used as an accompaniment to certain incantations. The mosaic floor was partly covered with the skins of enormous black and silver apes: and above the door there hung the head of a unicorn in which dwelt the familiar demon of Malygris, in the form of a coral viper with pale green belly and ashen mottlings. Books were piled everywhere: ancient volumes bound in serpent-skin, with verdigris-eaten clasps, that held the frightful lore of Atlantis, the pentacles that have power upon the demons of the earth and the moon, the spells that transmute or disintegrate the elements; and runes from a lost language of Hyperborea. which, when uttered aloud. were more deadly than poison or more potent than any philtre.\n\nBut, though these things and the power they held or symbolized were the terror of the peoples and the envy, of all rival magicians, the thoughts of Malygris were dark with immitigable melancholy, and weariness filled his heart as ashes fill the hearth where a great fire has died. Immovable he sat, implacable he mused, while the sun of afternoon, declining on the city and on the sea that was beyond the city, smote with autumnal rays through the window of greenish-yellow glass, and touched his shrunken hands with its phantom gold and fired the bales-rubies of his rings till they burned like demonian eyes. But in his musings there was neither light nor fire; and turning from the grayness of the present, from the darkness that seemed to close in so imminently upon the future, he groped among the shadows of memory, even as a blind man who has lost the sun and seeks it everywhere in vain. And all the vistas of time that had been so full of gold and splendor, the days of triumph that were colored like a soaring flame, the crimson and purple of the rich imperial years of his prime, all these were chill and dim and strangely faded now, and the remembrance thereof was no more than the stirring of dead embers. Then Malygris groped backward to the years of his youth, to the misty, remote, incredible years, where, like an alien star, one memory still burned with unfailing luster - the memory of the girl Nylissa whom he had loved in days ere the lust of unpermitted knowledge and necromantic dominion had ever entered his soul. He had well-nigh forgotten her for decades, in the myriad preoccupations of a life so bizarrely diversified, so replete with occult happenings and powers, with supernatural victories and perils; but now, at the mere thought of this slender and innocent child, who had loved him so dearly when he too was young and slim and guileless, and who had died of a sudden mysterious fever on the very eve of their marriage-day, the mummylike umber of his cheeks took on a phantom flush, and deep down in the icy orbs was a sparkle like the gleam of mortuary tapers. In his dreams arose the irretrievable suns of youth, and he saw the myrtle-shaded valley of Meros, and the stream Zemander, by whose ever-verdant marge he had walked at eventide with Nylissa, seeing the birth of summer stars in the heavens, the stream, and the eyes of his beloved.\n\nNow, addressing the demonian viper that dwelt in the head of the unicorn, Malygris spoke, with the low monotonous intonation of one who thinks aloud:\n\nViper, in the years before you came to dwell with me and to make your abode in the head of the unicorn, I knew a girl who was lovely and frail as the orchids of the jungle, and who died as the orchids die... Viper, am I mot Malygris, in whom is centered the mastery of all occult lore, all forbidden dominations, with dominion over the spirits of earth and sea and air, over the solar and lunar demons. over the living and the dead? If so I desire, can I not call the girl Nylissa, in the very semblance of all her youth and beauty, and bring her forth from the never-changing shadows of the cryptic tomb, to stand before me in this chamber, in the evening rays of this autumnal sun?'\n\n'Yes, master,' replied the viper, in a low but singularly penetrating hiss, 'you are Malygris, and all sorcerous or necromantic power is yours, all incantations and spells and pentacles are known to you, It is possible, if you so desire, to summon the girl Nylissa from her abode among the dead, and to behold her again as she was ere her loveliness had known the ravening kiss of the worm.'\n\n'Viper, is it well, is it meet, that I should summon her thus? ... Will there be nothing to lose, and nothing to regret?'\n\nThe viper seemed to hesitate. Then, in a more slow and neasured hiss: 'It is meet for Malygris to do as he would. Who, save Malygris, can decide if a thing be well or ill?'\n\n'In other words, you will not advise me?' the query was as much a statement as a question, and the viper vouchsafed no further utterance.\n\nMalygris brooded for awhile, with his chin on his knotted hands. Then he arose, with a long-unwonted celerity and sureness of movement that belied his wrinkles, and gathered together, from different coigns of the chamber, from ebony shelves, from caskets with locks of gold or brass or electrum, the sundry appurtenances that were needful for his magic. He drew on the floor the requisite circles, and standing within the centermost he lit the thuribles that contained the prescribed incense, and read aloud from a long narrow scroll of gray vellum the purple and vermilion runes of the ritual that summons the departed. The fumes of the censers, blue and white and violet, arose in thick clouds and speedily filled the room with ever-writhing interchanging columns, among which the sunlight disappeared and was succeeded by a wan unearthly glow, pale as the light of moons that ascend from Lethe. With preternatural slowness, with unhuman solemnity, the voice of the necromancer went on in a priest-like chant till the scroll was ended and the last echoes lessened and died out in hollow sepulchral vibrations. Then the colored vapors cleared away, as if the folds of a curtain had been drawn back. But the pale unearthly glow still filled the chamber, and between Malygris and the door where hung the unicorn's head there stood the apparition of Nylissa, even as she had stood in the perished years, bending a little like a wind-blown flower, and smiling with the unmindful poignancy of youth. Fragile, pallid, and simply gowned, with anemone blossoms in her black hair, with eyes that held the new-born azure of vernal heavens, she was all that Malygris had remembered, and his sluggish heart was quickened with an old delightful fever as he looked upon her.\n\n'Are you Nylissa? ' he asked — 'the Nylissa whom I loved in the myrtle-shaded valley of Meros, in the golden-hearted days that have gone with all dead eons to the timeless gulf?'\n\n'Yes, I am Nylissa,' Her voice was the simple and rippling silver of the voice that had echoed so long in his memory... But somehow, as he gazed and listened, there grew a tiny doubt — a doubt no less absurd than intolerable, but nevertheless insistent: was this altogether the same Nylissa he had known? Was there not some elusive change, too subtle to he named or defined, had time and the grave not taken something away — an innominable something that his magic had not wholly restored? Were the eyes as tender, was the black hair as lustrous, the form as slim and supple, as those of the girl he recalled? He could not be sure, and the growing doubt was succeeded by a leaden dismay, by a grim despondency that choked his heart as with ashes. His scrutiny became searching and exigent and cruel, and momently the phantom was less and less the perfect semblance of Nylissa, momently the lips and brow were less lovely, less subtle in their curves; the slender figure became thin, the tresses took on a common black and the neck an ordinary pallor. The soul of Malygris grew sick again with age and despair and the death of his evanescent hope. He could believe no longer in love or youth or beauty; and even the memory of these things was a dubitable mirage, a thing that might or might not have been. There was nothing left but shadow and grayness and dust, nothing but the empty dark and the cold, and a clutching weight of insufferable weariness, of immedicable anguish.\n\nIn accents that were thin and quavering, like the ghost of his former voice, he pronounced the incantation that serves to dismiss a summoned phantom. The form of Nylissa melted upon the air like smoke and the lunar gleam that had surrounded her was replaced by the last rays of the sun. Malygris turned to the viper and spoke in a tone of melancholy reproof:\n\n'Why did you not warn me?'\n\n'Would the warning have availed?' was the counter-question. 'All knowledge was yours, Malygris, excepting this one thing; and in no other way could you have learned it.'\n\n'What thing?' queried the magician. 'I have learned nothing except the vanity of wisdom, the impotence of magic, the nullity of love, and the delusiveness of memory... Tell me, why could I not recall to life the same Nylissa whom I knew, or thought I knew?'\n\n'It was indeed Nylissa whom you summoned and saw,' replied the viper. 'Your necromancy was potent up to this point; but no necromantic spell could recall for you your own lost youth or the fervent and guileless heart that loved Nylissa, or the ardent eyes that beheld her then. This, my master, was the thing that you had to learn.'",

        "content": "\n\nThere are many marvellous tales, untold, unwritten, never to be recorded or remembered, lost beyond all divining and all imagining, that sleep in the double silence of far-recessive time and space. The chronicles of Saturn, the archives of the moon in its prime, the legends of Antillia and Moaria—these are full of an unsurmised or forgotten wonder. And strange are the multitudinous tales withheld by the light-years of Polaris and the Galaxy. But none is stranger, none more marvellous, than the tale of Hotar and Evidon and their voyage to the planet Sfanomoë, from the last isle of foundering Atlantis. Harken, for I alone shall tell the story, who came in a dream to the changeless center where the past and future are always contemporary with the present; and saw the veritable happening thereof; and, waking, gave it words:\n\nHotar and Evidon were brothers in science as well as by consanguinity. They were the last representatives of a long line of illustrious inventors and investigators, all of whom had contributed more or less to the knowledge, wisdom, and scientific resources of a lofty civilization matured through cycles. One by one they and their fellow-savants had learned the arcanic secrets of geology, of chemistry, of biology, of astronomy; they had subverted the elements, had constrained the sea, the sun, the air, and the force of gravitation, compelling them to serve the uses of man; and lastly they had found a way to release the typhonic power of the atom, to destroy, transmute, and reconstruct the molecules of matter at will.\n\nHowever, by that irony which attends all the triumphs and achievements of man, the progress of this mastering of natural law was coincidental with the profound geologic changes and upheavals which caused the gradual sinking of Atlantis. Age by age, aeon by aeon, the process had gone on: huge peninsulas, whole sea-boards, high mountain-ranges, citied plains and plateaus, all went down in turn beneath the diluvial waves. With the advance of science, the time and location of future cataclysms was more accurately predictable; but nothing could be done to avert them.\n\nIn the days of Hotar and Evidon, all that remained of the former continent was a large isle, called Poseidonis. It was well known that this isle, with its opulent sea-ports, its aeon-surviving monuments of art and architecture, its fertile inland valleys, and mountains lifting their spires of snow above semi-tropic jungles, was destined to go down ere the sons and daughters of the present generation had grown to maturity.\n\nLike many others of their family, Hotar and Evidon had devoted long years of research to the obscure telluric laws governing the imminent catastrophe; and had sought to devise a means of prevention, or, at least, of retardation. But the seismic forces involved were too deeply seated and too widespread in their operation to be controllable in any manner or degree. No magnetic mechanism, no zone of repressive force, was powerful enough to affect them. When the two brothers were nearing middle-age, they realized the ultimate futility of their endeavors; and though the peoples of Poseidonis continued to regard them as possible saviors, whose knowledge and resource were well-nigh superhuman, they had secretly abandoned all effort to salvage the doomed isle, and had retired from sea-gazing Lephara, the immemorial home of their family, to a private observatory and laboratory far up in the mountains of the interior.\n\nHere, with the hereditary wealth at their command, the brothers surrounded themselves not only with all the known instruments and materials of scientific endeavor, but also with a certain degree of personal luxury. They were secluded from the world by a hundred scarps and precipices and by many leagues of little-trodden jungle; and they deemed this seclusion advisable for the labors which they now proposed to themselves, and whose real nature they had not divulged to anyone.\n\nHotar and Evidon had gone beyond all others of their time in the study of astronomy. The true character and relationship of the world, the sun, the moon, the planetary system, and the stellar universe, had long been known in Atlantis. But the brothers had speculated more boldly, had calculated more profoundly and more closely, than anyone else. In the powerful magnifying mirrors of their observatory, they had given special attention to the neighboring planets; had formed an accurate idea of their distance from the earth; had estimated their relative size; and had conceived the notion that several, or perhaps all, might well be inhabited by creatures similar to man; or, if not inhabited, were potentially capable of supporting human life.\n\nVenus, which the Atlanteans knew by the name of Sfanomoë, was the planet which drew their curiosity and their conjecture more than any other. Because of its position, they surmised that it might readily resemble the earth in climatic conditions and in all the prerequisites of biological development. And the hidden labor to which they were now devoting their energies was nothing less than the invention of a vehicle by which it would be possible to leave the ocean-threatened isle and voyage to Sfanomoë.\n\nDay by day the brothers toiled to perfect their invention; and night by night, through the ranging seasons, they peered at the lustrous orb of their speculations as it hung in the emerald evening of Poseidonis, or above the violet-shrouded heights that would soon take the saffron footprints of the dawn. And ever they gave themselves to bolder imaginings, to stranger and more perilous projects.\n\nThe vehicle they were building was designed with complete foreknowledge of all the problems to be faced, of all the difficulties to be overcome. Various types of air-vessels had been used in Atlantis for epochs; but they knew that none of these would be suitable for their purpose even in a modified form. The vehicle they finally devised, after much planning and long discussion, was a perfect sphere, like a miniature moon; since, as they argued, all bodies travelling through etheric space were of this shape. It was made with double walls of a metallic alloy whose secret they themselves had discovered—an alloy that was both light and tough beyond any substance classified by chemistry or mineralogy. There were a dozen small round windows lined with an unbreakable glass, and a door of the same alloy as the walls, that could be shut with hermetic tightness. The explosion of atoms in sealed cylinders was to furnish the propulsive and levitative power and would also serve to heat the sphere's interior against the absolute cold of space. Solidified air was to be carried in electrum containers and vaporized at the rate which would maintain a respirable atmosphere. And foreseeing that the gravitational influence of the Earth would lessen and cease as they went further and further away from it, they had established in the floor of the sphere a magnetic zone that would simulate the effect of gravity and thus obviate any bodily danger or discomfort to which they might otherwise be liable.\n\nThese labors were carried on with no other assistance than that of a few slaves, members of an aboriginal race of Atlantis, who had no conception of the purpose for which the vessel was being built; and who, to ensure their complete discretion, were deaf-mutes. There were no interruptions from visitors, for it was tacitly assumed throughout the isle that Hotar and Evidon were engaged in seismologic researches that required a concentration both profound and prolonged.\n\nAt length, after years of toil, of vacillation, doubt, anxiety, the sphere was completed. Shining like an immense bubble of silver, it stood on a westward-facing terrace of the laboratory, from which the planet Sfanomoë was now visible at eventide beyond the purpling sea of the jungle. All was in readiness: the vessel was amply provisioned for a journey of many lustrums and decades, and was furnished with an abundant supply of books, with implements of art and science, with all things necessary for the comfort and convenience of the voyagers.\n\nHotar and Evidon were now men of middle years, in the hale maturity of all their powers and faculties. They were the highest type of the Atlantean race, with fair complexions and lofty stature, with the features of a lineage both aristocratic and intellectual. Knowing the nearness of the final cataclysm, they had never married, they had not even formed any close ties; but had given themselves to science with a monastic devotion. They mourned the inevitable passing of their civilization, with all its epoch-garnered lore, its material and artistic wealth, its consummate refinement. But they had learned the universality of the laws whose operation was plunging Atlantis beneath the wave—the laws of change, of increase and decay; and they had schooled themselves to a philosophic resignation—a resignation which, mayhap, was not untempered by a foresight of the singular glory and novel, unique experiences that would be entailed by their flight upon hitherto-untravelled space.\n\nTheir emotions, therefore, were a mingling of altruistic regret and personal expectancy, when, on the evening chosen for their departure, they dismissed their wondering slaves with a writ of manumission, and entered the orb-shaped vessel. And Sfanomoë brightened before them with a pulsing luster, and Poseidonis darkened below, as they began their voyage into the sea-green heavens of the west.\n\nThe great vessel rose with a buoyant ease beneath their guidance; till soon they saw the lights of Susran the capital and its galley-crowded port Lephara, where nightly revels were held and the very fountains ran with wine that people might forget awhile the predicted doom. But so high in the air had the vessel climbed that Hotar and Evidon could hear no faintest murmur of the loud lyres and strident merrymaking in the cities beneath. And they went onward and upward, till the world was a dark blur and the skies were aflame with stars that their optic mirrors had never revealed. And anon the black planet below was rimmed with a growing crescent of fire, and they soared from its shadow to unsettling daylight. But the heavens were no longer a familiar blue, but had taken on the lucid ebon of ether; and no star nor world, not even the littlest, was dimmed by the rivalship of the sun. And brighter than all was Sfanomoë, where it hung with unvacillating lambence in the void.\n\nMile by stellar mile the earth was left behind; and Hotar and Evidon, peering ahead to the goal of their dreams, had almost forgotten it. Then, gazing back, they saw it was no longer below but above them, like a vaster moon. And studying its oceans and isles and continents, they named them over one by one from their maps as the globe revolved; but vainly they sought for Poseidonis, amid an unbroken glittering waste of sea. And the brothers were conscious of that regret and sorrow which is the just due of all evanished beauty, of all sunken splendor. And they mused awhile on the glory that had been Atlantis, and recalled to memory her obelisks and domes and mountains, her palms with high and haughty crests, and the fire-tall plumes of her warriors, that would lift no longer to the sun.\n\nTheir life in the orb-like vessel was one of ease and tranquillity, and differed little from that to which they were accustomed. They pursued their wonted studies, they went on with experiments they had planned or begun in past days, they read to each other the classic literature of Atlantis, they argued and discussed a million problems of philosophy or science. And time itself was scarcely heeded by Hotar and Evidon; and the weeks and months of their journey became years, and the years were added into lustrums, and the lustrums into decades. Nor were they sensible of the change in themselves and in each other, as the years began to weave a web of wrinkles in their faces, to tint their brows with the yellow ivory of age and to thread their sable beards with ermine. There were too many things to be solved or debated, too many speculations and surmises to be ventured, for such trivial details as these to usurp their attention.\n\nSfanomoë grew larger and larger as the half-oblivious years went by; till anon it rolled beneath them with strange markings of untravelled continents and seas unsailed by man. And now the discourse of Hotar and Evidon was wholly concerning the world in which they would so soon arrive, and the peoples, animals, and plants which they might expect to find. They felt in their ageless hearts the thrill of an anticipation without parallel, as they steered their vessel toward the ever-widening orb that swam below them. Soon they hung above its surface, in a cloud-laden atmosphere of tropic warmth; but though they were childishly eager to set foot on the new planet, they sagely decided to continue their journey on a horizontal level till they could study its topography with some measure of care and precision.\n\nTo their surprise, they found nothing in the bright expanse below that in any manner suggested the work of men or living beings. They had looked for towering cities of exotic aerial architecture, for broad thoroughfares and canals and geometrically measured areas of agricultural fields. Instead, there was only a primordial landscape of mountains, marshes, forests, oceans, rivers, and lakes.\n\nAt length they made up their minds to descend. Though they were old, old men, with five-foot ermine beards, they brought the moon-shaped vessel down with all the skill of which they had been capable in their prime; and opening the door that had been sealed for decades, they emerged in turn—Hotar preceding Evidon, since he was a little the elder.\n\nTheir first impressions were of a torrid heat, of dazzling color and overwhelming perfume. There seemed to be a million odors in the heavy, strange, unstirring air—odors that were almost visible in the form of wreathing vapors—perfumes that were like elixirs and opiates, that conferred at the same time a blissful drowsiness and a divine exhilaration. Then they saw that there were flowers everywhere—that they had descended in a wilderness of blossoms. They were all of unearthly form, of supermundane size and beauty and variety, with scrolls and volutes of petals many-hued, that seemed to curl and twist with a more than vegetable animation or sentiency. They grew from a ground that their overlapping stems and calyxes had utterly concealed; they hung from the boles and fronds of palm-like trees they had mantled beyond recognition; they thronged the water of still pools; they poised on the jungle-tops like living creatures winged for flight to the perfume-drunken heavens. And even as the brothers watched, the flowers grew and faded with a thaumaturgic swiftness, they fell and replaced each other as if by some legerdemain of natural law.\n\nHotar and Evidon were delighted, they called out to each other like children, they pointed at each new floral marvel that was more exquisite and curious than the rest; and they wondered at the speed of their miraculous growth and decay. And they laughed at the unexampled bizarrerie of the sight, when they perceived certain animals new to zoology, who were trotting about on more than the usual number of legs, with orchidaceous blossoms springing from their rumps.\n\nThey forgot their long voyage through space, they forgot there had ever been a planet called the earth and an isle named Poseidonis, they forgot their lore and their wisdom, as they roamed through the bowers of Sfanomoë. The exotic air and its odors mounted to their heads like a mighty wine; and the clouds of golden and snowy pollen which fell upon them from the arching arbors were potent as some fantastic drugs. It pleased them that their white beards and violet tunics should be powdered with this pollen and with the floating spores of plants that were alien to all terrene botany.\n\nSuddenly, Hotar cried out with a new wonder, and laughed with a more boisterous mirth than before. He had seen that an oddly folded leaf was starting from the back of his shrunken right hand. The leaf unfurled as it grew, it disclosed a flower-bud; and lo! the bud opened and became a triple-chaliced blossom of unearthly hues, adding a rich perfume to the swooning air. Then, on his left hand, another blossom appeared in like manner; and then leaves and petals were burgeoning from his wrinkled face and brow, were growing in successive tiers from his limbs and body, were mingling their hair-like tendrils and tongue-shaped pistils with his beard. He felt no pain, only an infantile surprise and bewilderment as he watched them.\n\nNow from the hands and limbs of Evidon, the blossoms also began to spring. And soon the two old me had ceased to wear a human semblance, and were hardly to be distinguished from the garland-laden trees about them. And they died with no agony, as if they were already part of the teeming floral life of Sfanomoë, with such perceptions and sensations as were appropriate to their new mode of existence. And before long their metamorphosis was complete, and every fiber of their bodies had undergone a dissolution into flowers. And the vessel in which they had made their voyage was embowered from sight in an ever-climbing mass of plants and blossoms.\n\nSuch was the fate of Hotar and Evidon, the last of the Atlanteans, and the first (if not also the last) of human visitors to Sfanomoë.\n\n\"A Voyage To Sfanomoë\" by Clark Ashton Smith.

        "content": "\n\nI thank you, friend, but I am no drinker of wine, not even if it be the rarest Canary or the oldest Amontillado. Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging . . . and more than others, I have reason to know the truth that was writ by Solomon the Jewish king. Give ear, if ye will, and I shall tell you a story such as would halt the half-drained cup on the lips of the hardiest bibber.\n\nWe were seven-and-thirty buccaneers, who raked the Spanish Main under Barnaby Dwale, he that was called Red Barnaby for the spilling of blood that attended him everywhere. Our ship, the Black Falcon, could outfly and outstrike all other craft that flew the Jolly Roger. Full often, Captain Dwale was wont to seek a remote isle on the eastward verge of the West Indies, and lighten the vessel of its weight of ingots and doubloons.\n\nThe isle was far from the common course of maritime traffic, and was not known to maps or other mariners; so it suited our purpose well. It was a place of palms and sand and cuffs, with a small harbor sheltered by the curving outstretched arms of rugged reefs, on which the dark ocean climbed and gnashed its fangs of white foam without troubling the tranquil waters beyond. I know not how many times we had visited the isle; but the soil beneath many a coco tree was heavy with our hidden trove. There we had stored the loot of bullion-laden ships, the massy plate and jewels of cathedral towns.\n\nEven as to all mortal things, an ending came at last to our visits. We had gathered a goodly cargo, but might have stayed longer on the open main where the Spaniards passed, if a tempest had not impended. We were near the secret isle, as it chanced, when the skies began to blacken; and wallowing heavily in the rising seas we fled to our placid harbor, reaching it by night-fall. Before dawn the hurricane had blown by; and the sun came up in cloudless amber and blue. We proceeded with the landing and burying of our chests of coin and gems and ingots, which was a task of some length; and afterward we refilled our water-casks at a cool sweet spring that ran from beneath the palmy hill not far inland.\n\nIt was now midafternoon. Captain Dwale was planning to weigh anchor shortly and follow the westering sun toward the Caribbees. There were nine of us, loading the last barrels into the boats, with Red Barnaby looking on and cursing us for being slower than mud-turtles; and we were bending knee-deep in the tepid, lazy water, when suddenly the captain ceased to swear, and we saw that he was no longer watching us. He had turned his back and was stooping over a strange object that must have drifted in with the tide, after the storm: a huge and barnacle-laden thing that lay on the sand, half in and half out of the shoaling water. Somehow, none of us had perceived it hereto-fore.\n\nRed Barnaby was not silent long.\n\n\"Come here, ye chancre-eaten coistrels,\" he called to us. We obeyed willingly enough, and gathered around the beached object, which our captain was examining with much perplexity. We too were greatly bewondered when we saw the thing more closely; and none of us could name it offhand or with certainty.\n\nThe object had the form of a great jar, with a tapering neck and a deep, round, abdomens body. It was wholly encrusted with shells and corals that had gathered upon it as if through many ages in the ocean deeps, and was festooned with weeds and sea-flowers such as we had never before beheld; so that we could not determine the substance of which it was made.\n\nAt the order of Captain Dwale, we rolled it out of the water and beyond reach of the tide, into the shade of nearby palms; though it required the efforts of four men to move the unwieldy thing, which was strangely ponderous. We found that it would stand easily on end, with its top reaching almost to the shoulders of a tall man. While we were handling the great jar, we heard a swishing noise from within, as if it were filled with some sort of liquor.\n\nOur captain, as it chanced, was a learned man.\n\n\"By the communion cup of Satan!\" he swore. \"If this thing is not an antique wine-jar, then I am a Bed-lamite. Such vessels-though mayhap they were not so huge-were employed by the Romans to store the goodly vintages of Falernus and Cecuba. Indeed, there is today a Spanish wine-that of Valdepenas - which is kept in earthen jars. But this, if I mistake not, is neither from Spain nor olden Rome. It is ancient enough, by its look, to have come from that long-sunken isle, the Atlantis whereof Plato speaks. Truly, there should be a rare vintage within, a wine that was mellowed in the youth of the world, before the founding of Rome and Athens; and which, perchance, has gathered fire and strength with the centuries. Ho! my rascal sea-bullies! We sail not from this harbor till the jar is broached. And if the liquor within be sound and potable, we shall make holiday this evening on the sands.\"\n\n\"Belike, 'tis a funeral urn, full of plaguey cinders and ashes,\" said the mate, Roger Aglone, who had a gloomy turn of thought.\n\nRed Barnaby had drawn his cutlas and was busily prying away the crust of barnacles and quaint fantastic coral-growths from the top of the jar. Layer on layer of them he removed, and swore mightily at this increment of forgotten years. At last a great stopper of earthen-ware, sealed with a clear wax that bad grown harder than amber, was revealed by his prying. The stopper was graven with queer letters of an unknown language, plainly to be seen; but the wax refused the cutlas—point. So, losing all patience, the captain seized a mighty fragment of stone, which a lesser man could scarce have lifted, and broke therewith the neck of the jar.\n\nNow even in those days, I, Stephen Magbane, the one Puritan amid that Christless crew, was no bibber of wine or spirituous liquors, but a staunch Rechabite on all occasions. Therefore I held back-, feeling little concern other than that of reprobation, while the others pressed about the jar and sniffed greedily at the con-tents. But, almost immediately with its opening, my nostrils were assailed by an odor of heathen spices, heavy and strange; and the very inhalation thereof caused me to feel a sort of giddiness, so that I thought it well to retreat still further. But the others were eager as midges around a fermenting-vat in autumn.\n\n\" 'Sblood! 'Tis a royal vintage!\" roared the captain, after he had dipped a forefinger in the jar and sucked the purple drops that dripped from it. \"Avast, ye slumgullions! Stow the water-casks on board, and summon all hands ashore, leaving only a watch there to ward the vessel. We'll have a gala night before we sack any more Spaniards.\"\n\nWe obeyed his order; and there was much rejoicing amid the crew of the Black Falcon at the news of our find and the postponement of the voyage. Three men, grumbling sorely at their absence from the revels, were left on board; though, in that tranquil harbor, such vigilance was virtually needless. We others returned to the shore, bringing a supply of pannikins in which to serve the wine, and provisions for a feast. Then we gathered pieces of drift with which to build a great fire, and caught several huge tortoises along the sands, and unearthed their hidden eggs, so that we might have an abundance and variety of victuals.\n\nIn these preparations I took part with no special ardor. Knowing my habit of abstention, and being of a somewhat malicious and tormenting humor, Captain Dwale had expressly commanded my presence at the feast. However, I anticipated nothing more than a little ribaldry at my expense, as was customary at such times; and being partial to fresh tortoise-meat, I was not wholly unresigned to my lot as a witness of the Babylonian inebrieties of the others.\n\nAt nightfall, the feasting and drinking began; and the fire of driftwood, with eery witch-colors of blue and green and white amid the flame, leapt high in the dusk while the sunset died to a handful of red embers far on purpling seas.\n\nIt was a strange wine that the crew and captain swilled from their pannikins. I saw that the stuff was thick and dark, as if it had been mingled with blood; and the air was filled with the reek of those pagan spices, hot and rich and unholy, that might have poured from a broken tomb of antique emperors. And stranger still was the intoxication of that wine; for those who drank it became still and thoughtful and sullen; and there was no singing of lewd songs, no playing of apish antics.\n\nRed Barnaby had been drinking longer than the others, having begun to sample the vintage while the crew were making ready for their revel. To our wonderment, he ceased to swear at us after the first cupful, and no longer ordered us about or paid us any heed, but sat peering into the sunset with eyes that held the dazzlement of unknown dreams. And one by one, as they began to drink, the others were likewise affected, so that I marvelled much at the unwonted power of the wine. I had never before beheld an intoxication of such nature; for they spoke not nor ate, and moved only to refill their cups from the mighty jar.\n\nThe night had grown dark as indigo beyond the flickering fire, and there was no moon; and the firelight blinded the stars. But one by one, after an interval, the drinkers rose from their places and stood staring into the darkness toward the sea. Unquietly they stood, and strained forward, peering intently as men who behold some marvelous thing; and queerly they muttered to one another, with unintelligible words. I knew not why they stared and muttered thus, unless it were because of some madness that had come upon them from the wine; for naught was visible in the dark, and I heard nothing, save the low murmur of wavelets lapping on the sand.\n\nLouder grew the muttering; and some raised their bands and pointed seaward, babbling wildly as if in delirium. Noting their demeanor, and doubtful as to what further turn their madness might take, I bethought me to withdraw along the shore. But when I began to move away, those who were nearest me appeared to waken from their dream, and restrained me with rough hands. Then, with drunken, gibbering words, of which I could make no sense, they held me helpless while one of their number forced me to drink from a pannikin filled with the purple wine.\n\nI fought against them, doubly unwilling to quaff that nameless vintage, and much of it was spilled. The stuff was sweet as liquid honey to the taste, but burned like hell-fire in my throat. I turned giddy; and a sort of dark confusion possessed my senses by degrees; and I seemed to hear and see and feel as in the, mounting fever of calenture.\n\nThe air about me seemed to brighten, with a redness of ghostly blood that was everywhere; a light that came not from the fire nor from the nocturnal heavens. I be-held the faces and forms of the drinkers, standing with-out shadow, as if mantled with a rosy phosphorescence. And beyond them, where they stared in troubled and restless wonder, the darkness was illumed with the strange light.\n\nMad and unholy was the vision that I saw: for the harbor waves no longer lapped on the sand, and the sea had wholly vanished. The Black Falcon was gone, and where the reefs had been, great marble walls ascended, flushed as if with the ruby of lost sunsets. Above them were haughty domes of heathen temples, and spires of pagan palaces; and beneath were mighty streets and causeys where people passed in a never—ending throng. I thought that I gazed upon some immemorial city, such as had flourished in Earth's prime; and I saw the trees of its terraced gardens, fairer than the palms of Eden. Listening, I heard the sound of dulcimers that were sweet as the moaning of women; and the cry of horns that told forgotten glorious things; and the wild sweet singing of people who passed to some hidden, sacred festival within the walls.\n\nI saw that the light poured upward from the city, and was born of its streets and buildings. It blinded the heavens above; and the horizon beyond was lost in a shining mist. One building there was, a high fane above the rest, from which the light streamed in a muddier flood; and from its open portals music came, sorcerous and beguiling as the far voices of bygone years. And the revellers passed gayly into its portals, but none came forth. The weird music seemed to call me and entice me; and I longed to tread the streets of the alien city, and a deep desire was upon me to mingle with its people and pass into the glowing fane.\n\nVerily I knew why the drinkers had stared at the darkness and had muttered among themselves in wonder. I knew that they also longed to descend into the city. And I saw that a great causey, built of marble and gleaming with the red luster, ran downward from their very feet over meadows of unknown blossoms to the foremost buildings.\n\nThen, as I watched and listened, the singing grew sweeter, the music stranger, and the rosy luster brightened. Then, with no backward glance, no word or gesture of injunction to his men, Captain Dwale went slowly forward, treading the marble causey like a dreamer who walks in his dream. And after him, one by one, Roger Aglone and the crew followed in the same manner, going toward the city.\n\nHaply I too should have followed, drawn by the witching music. For truly it seemed that I had trod the ways of that city in former time, and had known the things whereof the music told and the voices sang. Well did I remember why the people passed eternally into the fane, and why they came not forth; and there, it seemed, I should meet familiar and beloved faces, and take part in mysteries recalled from the foundered years.\n\nAll this, which the wine had remembered through its sleep in the ocean depths, was mine to behold and conceive for a moment. And well it was that I had drunk less of that evil and pagan vintage than the others, and was less besotted than they with its luring vision. For, even as Captain Dwale and his crew went toward the city, it appeared to me that the rosy glow began to fade a little. The walls took on a wavering thinness, and the domes grew insubstantial. The rose departed, the light was pale as a phosphor of the tomb; and the people went to and fro like phantoms, with a thin crying of ghostly horns and a ghostly singing. Dimly above the sunken causey the harbor waves returned; and Red Barnaby and his men walked down beneath them. Slowly the waters darkened above the fading spires and walls; and the midnight blackened upon the sea; and the city was lost like the vanished bubbles of wine.\n\nA terror came upon me, knowing the fate of those others. I fled swiftly, stumbling in darkness toward the palmy hill that crowned the isle. No vestige remained of the rosy fight; and the sky was filled with returning stars. And looking oceanward as I climbed the hill, I saw a lantern that burned on the Black Falcon in the harbor, and discerned the embers of our fire that smoldered on the sands. Then, praying with a fearful fervor, I waited for dawn.",

        "content": "\n\nMY NAME is Pharpetron, among those who have known me in Poseidonis; but even I, the last and most forward pupil of the wise Avyctes, know not the name of that which I am fated to become ere to-morrow. Therefore, by the ebbing silver lamps, in my master's marble house above the loud, ever-ravening sea, I write this tale with a hasty hand, scrawling an ink of wizard virtue on the grey, priceless, antique parchment of dragons. And having written, I shall enclose the pages in a sealed cylinder of orichalchum, and shall cast the cylinder from a high window into the sea, lest that which I am doomed to become should haply destroy the writing. And it may be that mariners from Lephara, passing to Umb and Pneor in their tall triremes, will find the cylinder; or fishers will draw it from the wave in their seines of byssus; and having read my story, men will learn the truth and take warning; and no man's feet, henceforward, will approach the pale and demon- haunted house of Avyctes.\n\nFor six years, I have dwelt apart with the aged master, forgetting youth and its wonted desires in the study of arcanic things. Together, we have delved more deeply than all others before us in an interdicted lore; we have solved the keyless hieroglyphs that guard ante-human formulae; we have talked with the prehistoric dead; we have called up the dwellers in sealed crypts, in fearful abysses beyond space. Few are the sons of mankind who have cared to seek us out among the desolate, wind-worn crags; and many, but nameless, are the visitants who have come to us from further bourns of place and time.\n\nStern and white as a tomb, older than the memory of the dead, and built by men or devils beyond the recording of myth, is the mansion in which we dwell. Far below, on black, naked reefs, the northern sea climbs and roars indomitably, or ebbs with a ceaseless murmur as of armies of baffled demons; and the house is filled evermore, like a hollow-sounding sepulcher, with the drear echo of its tumultuous voices; and the winds wail in dismal wrath around the high towers, but shake them not. On the seaward side, the mansion rises sheerly from the straight-falling cliff; but on the other sides there are narrow terraces, grown with dwarfish, crooked cedars that bow always beneath the gale. Giant marble monsters guard the landward portals; and huge marble women ward the strait porticoes above the sea; and mighty statues and mummies stand everywhere in the chambers and along the halls. But, saving these, and the spirits we have summoned, there is none to companion us; and liches and shadows have been the servitors of our daily needs.\n\nAll men have heard the fame of Avyctes, the sole surviving pupil of that Malygris who tyrannized in his necromancy over Susran from a tower of sable stone; Malygris, who lay dead for years while men believed him living; who, lying thus, still uttered potent spells and dire oracles with decaying lips. But Avyctes lusted not for temporal power in the manner of Malygris; and having learned all that the elder sorcerer could teach him, withdrew from the cities of Poseidonis to seek another and vaster dominion; and I, the youth Pharpetron, in the latter years of Avyctes, was permitted to join him in this solitude; and since then, I have shared his austerities and vigils and evocations . . . and now, likewise, I must share the weird doom that has come in answer to his summoning.\n\nNot without terror (since man is but mortal) did I, the neophyte, behold at first the abhorrent and tremendous faces of them that obeyed Avyctes: the genii of the sea and earth, of the stars and the heavens, who passed to and fro in his marmorean halls. I shuddered at the black writhing of submundane things from the many-volumed smoke of the braziers; I cried in horror at the grey foulnesses, colossal, without form, that crowded malignly about the drawn circle of seven colors, threatening unspeakable trespass on us that stood at the center. Not without revulsion did I drink wine that was poured by cadavers, and eat bread that was purveyed by phantoms. But use and custom dulled the strangeness, destroyed the fear; and in time I believed implicitly that Avyctes was the lord of all incantations and exorcisms, with infallible power to dismiss the beings he evoked.\n\nWell had it had been for Avyctes-- and for me-- if the master had contented himself with the lore preserved from Atlantis and Thule, or brought over from Mu and Mayapan. Surely this should have been enough: for in the ivory-sheeted books of Thule there were blood-writ runes that would call the demons of the fifth and seventh planets, if spoken aloud at the hour of their ascent; and the sorcerers of Mu had left record of a process whereby the doors of far-future time could be unlocked; and our fathers, the Atlanteans, had known the road between the atoms and the path into far stars, and had held speech with the spirits of the sun. But Avyctes thirsted for a darker knowledge, a deeper empery; and into his hands, in the third year of my novitiate, there came the mirror-bright tablet of the lost serpent-people.\n\nStrange, and apparently fortuitous, was our finding of the tablet. At certain hours, when the tide had fallen from the steep rocks, we were wont to descend by cavern-hidden stairs to a cliff-walled crescent beach behind the promontory on which stood the house of Avyctes. There, on the dun, wet sands, beyond the foamy tongues of the surf, would lie the worn and curious driftage of alien shores, and trove that hurricanes had cast up from unsounded deeps. And there we had found the purple and sanguine volutes of great shells, and rude lumps of ambergris, and white flowers of perpetually blooming coral; and once, the barbaric idol of green brass that had been the figurehead of a galley from far hyperboreal isles.\n\nThere had been a great storm, such as must have riven the sea to its nethermost profound; but the tempest had gone by with morning, and the heavens were cloudless on that fatal day when we found the tablet, and the demon winds were hushed among the high crags and chasms; and the sea lisped with a low whisper, like the rustle of gowns of samite trailed by fleeing maidens on the sand. And just beyond the ebbing wave, in a tangle of russet sea-weed, we beheld a thing that glittered with blinding sun-like brilliance. And running forward, I plucked it from the wrack before the wave's return, and bore it to Avyctes.\n\nThe tablet was wrought of some nameless metal, like never-rusting iron, but heavier. It had the form of a triangle and was broader at the widest than a man's heart. On one side it was wholly blank; and Avyctes and I, in turn, beheld our features mirrored strangely, like the drawn, pallid features of the dead, in its burnished surface. On the other side many rows of small crooked ciphers were incised deeply in the metal, as if by the action of some mordant acid; and these ciphers were not the pictorial symbols or alphabetic characters of any language known to the master or to me.\n\nOf the tablet's age and origin, likewise, we could form no conjecture; and our erudition was altogether baffled. For many days thereafter we studied the writing and held argument that came to no issue. And night by night, in a high chamber closed against the perennial winds, we pondered over the dazzling triangle by the tall straight flames of silver lamps. For Avyctes deemed that knowledge of rare value (or haply some secret of an alien or elder magic) was holden by the clueless crooked ciphers. Then, since all our scholarship was in vain, the master sought another divination, and had recourse to wizardy and necromancy. But at first, among the devils and phantoms that answered our interrogation, none could tell us aught concerning the tablet. And any other than Avyctes would have despaired in the end . . . and well would it have been if he had despaired, and had sought no longer to decipher the writing ....\n\nThe months and years went by with a slow thundering of seas on the dark rocks, and a headlong clamor of winds around the white towers. Still we continued our delvings and evocations; and further, always further we went into lampless realms of space and spirit; learning, perchance, to unlock the hithermost of the manifold infinities. And at whiles, Avyctes would resume his pondering of the sea-found tablet; or would question some visitant from other spheres of time and place regarding its interpretation.\n\nAt last, by the use of a chance formula, in idle experiment, he summoned up the dim, tenuous ghost of a sorcerer from prehistoric years; and the ghost, in a thin whisper of uncouth, forgotten speech, informed us that the letters on the tablet were those of a language of the serpent-men, whose primordial continent had sunk aeons before the lifting of Hyperborea from the ooze. But the ghost could tell us naught of their significance; for, even in his time, the serpent-people had become a dubious legend; and their deep, ante- human lore and sorcery were things irretrievable by man.\n\nNow, in all the books of conjuration owned by Avyctes, there was no spell whereby we could call the lost serpent-men from their fabulous epoch. But there was an old Lemurian formula, recondite and uncertain, by which the shadow of a dead man could be sent into years posterior to those of his own life-time, and could be recalled after an interim by the wizard. And the shade, being wholly insubstantial, would suffer no harm from the temporal transition, and would remember, for the information of the wizard, that which he had been instructed to learn during the journey.\n\nSo, having called again the ghost of the prehistoric sorcerer, wnose name was Ybith, Avyctes made a singular use of several very ardent gums and combustible fragments of fossil wood; and he and I, reciting the responses to the formula, sent the thin spirit of Ybith into the far ages of the serpent-men. And after a time which the master deemed sufficient, we performed the curious rites of incantation that would recall Ybith from his alienage. And the rites were successful; and Ybith stood before us again, like a blown vapor that is nigh to vanishing. And in words that were faint as the last echo of perishing memories, the specter told us the key to the meaning of the letters, which he had learned in the primeval past; and after this, we questioned Ybith no more, but suffered him to return unto slumber and oblivion.\n\nThen, knowing the import of the tiny, twisted ciphers, we read the writing on the tablet and made thereof a transliteration, though not without labor and difficulty, since the very phonetics of the serpent tongue, and the symbols and ideas expressed in the writing, were somewhat alien to those of mankind. And when we had mastered the inscription, we found that it contained the formula for a certain evocation which, no doubt, had been used by the serpent sorcerers. But the object of the evocation was not named; nor was there any clue to the nature or identity of that which would come in answer to the rites. And moreover there was no corresponding rite of exorcism nor spell of dismissal.\n\nGreat was the jubilation of Avyctes, deeming that we had learned a lore beyond the memory or prevision of man. And though I sought to dissuade him, he resolved to employ the evocation, arguing that our discovery was no chance thing but was fatefully predestined from the beginning. And he seemed to think lightly of the menace that might be brought upon us by the conjuration of things whose nativity and attributes were wholly obscure. \"For,\" said Avyctes, \"I have called up, in all the years of my sorcery, no god or devil, no demon or lich or shadow, which I could not control and dismiss at will. And I am loath to believe that any power or spirit beyond the subversion of my spells could have been summoned by a race of serpents, whatever their skill in demonism and necromancy.\"\n\nSo, seeing that he was obstinate, and aeknowledging him for my master in all ways, I consented to aid Avyctes in the experiment, though not without dire misgivings. And then we gathered together, in the chamber of conjuration, at the specified hour and configuration of the stars, the equivalents of sundry rare materials that the tablet had instructed us to use in the ritual.\n\nOf much that we did, and of certain agents that we employed, it were better not to tell; nor shall I record the shrill, sibilant words, difficult for beings not born of serpents to articulate, whose intonation formed a signal part of the ceremony. Toward the last, we drew a triangle on the marble floor with the fresh blood of birds; and Avyctes stood at one angle, and I at another; and the gaunt umber mummy of an Atlantean warrior, whose name had been Oigos, was stationed at the third angle. And standing thus, Avyctes and I held tapers of corpse-tallow in our hands, till the tapers had burned down between our fingers as into a socket. And in the outstretched palms of the mummy of Oigos, as if in shallow thuribles, talc and asbestos burned, ignited by a strange fire whereof we knew the secret. At one side we had traced on the floor an infrangible ellipse, made by an endless linked repetition of the twelve unspeakable Signs of Oumor, to which we could retire if the visitant should prove inimical or rebellious. We waited while the pole-circling stars went over, as had been prescribed. Then, when the tapers had gone out between our seared fingers, and the talc and asbestos were wholly consumed in the mummy's eaten palms, Avyctes uttered a single word whose sense was obscure to us; and Oigos, being animated by sorcery and subject to our will, repeated the word after a given interval, in tones that were hollow as a tomb-born echo; and I in my turn also repeated it.\n\nNow, in the chamber of evocation, before beginning the ritual, we had opened a small window giving upon the sea, and had likewise left open a high door on the hall to landward, lest that which came in answer to us should require a spatial mode of entrance. And during the ceremony, the sea became still and there was no wind, and it seemed that all things were hushed in awful expectation of the nameless visitor. But after all was done, and the last word had been repeated by Oigos and me, we stood and waited vainly for a visible sign or other manifestation. The lamps burned stilly in the midnight room; and no shadows fell, other than were cast by ourselves and Oigos and by the great marble women along the walls. And in the magic mirrors we had placed cunningly, to reflect those that were otherwise unseen, we beheld no breath or trace of any image.\n\nAt this, after a reasonable interim, Avyctes was sorely disappointed, deeming that the evocation had failed of its purpose; and I, having the same thought, was secretly relieved. And we questioned the mummy of Oigos, to learn if he had perceived in the room, with such senses as are peculiar to the dead, the sure token or doubtful proof of a presence undescried by us the living. And the mummy gave a necromantic answer, saying that there was nothing.\n\n\"Verily,\" said Avyctes, \"it were useless to wait longer. For surely in some way we have misunderstood the purport of the writing, or have failed to duplicate the matters used in the evocation, or the correct intonement of the words. Or it may be that in the lapse of so many aeons, the thing that was formerly wont to respond has long ceased to exist, or has altered in its attributes so that the spell is now void and valueless.\" To this I assented readily, hoping that the matter was at an end. So, after erasing the blood-marked triangle and the sacred ellipse of the linked Signs of Oumor, and after dismissing Oigos to his wonted place among other mummies, we retired to sleep. And in the days that followed, we resumed our habitual studies, but made no mention to each other of the strange triangular tablet or the vain formula.\n\nEven as before, our days went on; and the sea climbed and roared in white fury on the cliffs, and the winds wailed by in their unseen, sullen wrath, bowing the dark cedars as witches are bowed by the breath of Taaran, god of evil. Almost, in the marvel of new tests and cantraips, I forgot the ineffectual conjuration, and I deemed that Avyctes had also forgotten it.\n\nAll things were as of yore, to our sorcerous perception; and there was naught to trouble us in our wisdom and power and serenity, which we deemed secure above the sovereignty of kings. Reading the horoscopic stars, we found no future ill in their aspect; nor was any shadow of bale foreshown to us through geomancy, or other modes of divination such as we employed. And our familiars, though grisly and dreadful to mortal gaze, were wholly obedient to us the masters.\n\nThen, on a clear summer afternoon, we walked, as was often our custom, on the marble terrace behind the house. In robes of ocean-purple, we paced among the windy trees with their blown, crooked shadows; and there, following us as we went to and fro, I saw the blue shadow of Avyctes and my own shadow on the marble; and between them, an adumbration that was not wrought by any of the cedars. And I was greatly startled, but spoke not of the matter to Avyctes, and observed the unknown shadow with covert care.\n\nI saw that it followed closely the shadow of Avyctes, keeping ever the same distance. And it fluttered not in the wind, but moved with a flowing as of some heavy, thick, putrescent liquid; and its color was not blue nor purple nor black, nor any other hue to which man's eyes are habituated, but a hue as of some unearthly purulence; and its form was altogether monstrous, having a squat head and a long, undulant body, without similitude to beast or devil.\n\nAvyctes heeded not the shadow; and still I feared to speak, though I thought it an ill thing for the master to be companioned thus. And I moved closer to him, in order to detect by touch or other perception the invisible presence that had cast the adumbration. But the air was void to sunward of the shadow; and I found nothing opposite the sun nor in any oblique direction, though I searched closely, knowing that certain beings cast their shadows thus.\n\nAfter a while, at the customary hour, we returned by the coiling stairs and monster-flanked portals into the high house. And I saw that the strange adumbration moved ever behind the shadow of Avyctes, falling horrible and unbroken on the steps and passing clearly separate and distinct amid the long umbrages of the towering monsters. And in the dim halls beyond the sun, where shadows should not have been, I beheld with terror the distorted loathly blot, having a pestilent, unnamable hue, that followed Avyctes as if in lieu of his own extinguished shadow. And all that day, everywhere that we went, at the table served by specters, or in the mummy-warded room of volumes and books, the thing pursued Avyctes, clinging to him even as leprosy to the leper. And still the master had perceived it not; and still I forbore to warn him, hoping that the visitant would withdraw in its own time, going obscurely as it had come.\n\nBut at midnight, when we sat together by the silver lamps, pondering the blood-writ runes of Hyperborea, I saw that the shadow had drawn closer to the shadow of Avyctes, towering behind his chair on the wall between the huge sculptured women and the mummies. And the thing was a streaming ooze of charnel pollution, a foulness beyond the black leprosies of hell; and I could bear it no more; and I cried out in my fear and loathing, and informed the master of its presence.\n\nBeholding now the shadow, Avyctes considered it closesly and in silence; and there was neither fear nor awe nor abhorrence in the deep, graven wrinkles of his visage. And he said to me at last:\n\n\"This thing is a mystery beyond my lore; but never, in all the practice of my art, has any shadow come to me unbidden. And since all others of our evocations have found answer ere this, I must deem that the shadow is a veritable entity, or the sign of an entity, that has come in belated response to the formula of the serpent-sorcerers, which we thought powerless and void. And I think it well that we should now repair to the chamber of conjuration, and interrogate the shadow in such manner as we may, to inquire its nativity and purpose.\"\n\nWe went forthwith into the chamber of conjuration, and made such preparations as were both necessary and possible. And when we were prepared to question it, the unknown shadow had drawn closer still to the shadow of Avyctes, so that the clear space between the two was no wider than the thickness of a necromancer's rod.\n\nNow, in all ways that were feasible, we interrogated the shadow, speaking through our own lips and the lips of mummies and statues. But there was no determinable answer; and calling certain of the devils and phantoms that were our familiars, we made question through the mouths of these, but without result. And all the while, our magic mirrors were void of any reflection of a presence that might have cast the shadow; and they that had been our spokesmen could detect nothing in the room. And there was no spell, it seemed, that had power upon the visitant. So Avyctes became troubled; and drawing on the floor with blood and ashes the ellipse of Oumor, wherein no demon nor spirit may intrude, he retired to its center. But still within the ellipse, like a flowing taint of liquid corruption, the shadow followed his shadow; and the space between the two was no wider than the thickness of a wizard's pen.\n\nNow, on the face of Avyctes, horror had graven new wrinkles; and his brow was beaded with a deathly sweat. For he knew, even as I, that this was a thing beyond all laws, and foreboding naught but disaster and evil. And he cried to me in a shaken voice, and said:\n\n\"I have no knowledge of this thing nor its intention toward me, and no power to stay its progress. Go forth and leave me now; for I would not that any man should witness the defeat of my sorcery and the doom that may follow thereupon. Also, it were well to depart while there is time, lest you too should become the quarry of the shadow and be compelled to share its menace.\"\n\nThough terror had fastened upon my inmost soul, I was loath to leave Avyctes. But I had sworn to obey his will at all times and in every respect; and moreover I knew myself doubly powerless against the adumbration, since Avyctes himself was impotent.\n\nSo, bidding him farewell, I went forth with trembling limbs from the haunted chamber; and peering back from the threshold, I saw that the alien umbrage, creeping like a noisome blotch on the floor, had touched the shadow of Avyctes. And at that moment the master shrieked aloud like one in nightmare; and his face was no longer the face of Avyctes but was contorted and convulsed like that of some helpless madman who wrestles with an unseen incubus. And I looked no more, but fled along the dim outer hall and through the high portals giving upon the terrace.\n\nA red moon, ominous and gibbous, had declined above the terrace and the crags; and the shadows of the cedars were elongated in the moon; and they wavered in the gale like the blown cloaks of enchanters. And stooping against the gale, I fled across the terrace toward the outer stairs that led to a steep path in the riven waste of rocks and chasms behind Avyctes' house. I neared the terrace edge, running with the speed of fear; but I could not reach the topmost outer stair; for at every step the marble flowed beneath me, fleeing like a pale horizon before the seeker. And though I raced and panted without pause, I could draw no nearer to the terrace edge.\n\nAt length I desisted, seeing that an unknown spell had altered the very space about the house of Avyctes, so that none could escape therefrom to landward. So, resigning myself in despair to whatever might befall, I returned toward the house. And climbing the white stairs in the low, level beams of the crag-caught moon, I saw a figure that awaited me in the portals. And I knew by the trailing robe of sea-purple, but by no other token, that the figure was Avyctes. For the face was no longer in its entirety the face of man, but was become a loathly fluid amalgam of human features with a thing not to be identified on earth. The transfiguration was ghastlier than death or the changes of decay; and the face was already hued with the nameless, corrupt and purulent color of the strange shadow, and had taken on, in respect to its outlines, a partial likeness to the squat profile of the shadow. The hands of the figure were not those of any terrene being; and the shape beneath the robe had lengthened with a nauseous undulant pliancy; and the face and fingers seemed to drip in the moon- light with a deliquescent corruption. And the pursuing umbrage, like a thickly flowing blight, had corroded and distorted the very shadow of Avyctes, which was now double in a manner not to be narrated here.\n\nFain would I have cried or spoken aloud; but horror had dried up the fount of speech. And the thing that had been Avyctes beckoned me in silence, uttering no word from its living and putrescent lips. And with eyes that were no longer eyes, but had become an oozing abomination, it peered steadily upon me. And it clutched my shoulder closely with the soft leprosy of its fingers, and led me half-swooning with revulsion along the hall, and into that room where the mummy of Oigos, who had assisted us in the threefold incantation of the serpent-men, was stationed with several of his fellows.\n\nBy the lamps which illumed the chamber, burning with pale, still, perpetual flames, I saw that the mummies stood erect along the wall in their exanimate repose, each in his wonted place with his tall shadow beside him. But the great, gaunt shadow of Oigos on the marble wall was companioned by an adumbration similar in all respects to the evil thing that had followed the master and was now incorporate with him. I remembered that Oigos had performed his share of the ritual, and had repeated an unknown stated word in turn after Avyctes; and so I knew that the horror had come to Oigos in turn, and would wreak itself upon the dead even as on the living. For the foul, anonymous thing that we had called in our presumption could manifest itself to mortal ken in no other way than this. We had drawn it from unfathomable depths of time and space, using ignorantly a dire formula; and the thing had come at its own chosen hour, to stamp itself in abomination uttermost on the evocators.\n\nSince then, the night has ebbed away, and a second day has gone by like a sluggish ooze of horror. . . . I have seen the complete identification of the shadow with the flesh and the shadow of Avyctes . . . and also I have seen the slow encroachment of that other umbrage, mingling itself with the lank shadow and the sere, bituminous body of Oigos, and turning them to a similitude of the thing which Avyctes has become. And I have heard the mummy cry out like a living man in great pain and fear, as with the throes of a second dissolution, at the impingement of the shadow. And long since it has grown silent, like the other horror, and I know not its thoughts or its intent. . . . And verily I know not if the thing that has come to us be one or several; nor if its avatar will rest complete with the three that summoned it forth into time, or be extended to others.\n\nBut these things, and much else, I shall soon know; for now, in turn, there is a shadow that follows mine, drawing ever closer. The air congeals and curdles with an unseen fear; and they that were our familiars have fled from the mansion; and the great marble women seem to tremble where they stand along the walls. But the horror that was Avyctes, and the second horror that was Oigos, have left me not, and neither do they tremble. And with eyes that are not eyes, they seem to brood and watch, waiting till I too shall become as they. And their stillness is more terrible than if they had rended me limb from limb. And there are strange voices in the wind, and alien roarings upon the sea; and the walls quiver like a thin veil in the black breath of remote abysses.\n\nSo, knowing that the time is brief, I have shut myself in the room of volumes and books and have written this account. And I have taken the bright triangular tablet, whose solution was our undoing, and have cast it from the window into the sea, hoping that none will find it after us. And now I must make an end, and enclose this writing in the sealed cylinder of orichalchum, and fling it forth to drift upon the wave. For the space between my shadow and the shadow of the horror is straitened momently. . . . and the space is no wider than the thickness of a wizard's pen.",
        "content_cn": "我名为法尔佩特隆，在波塞冬尼斯认识我的人皆如此称呼；但即便是身为智者阿维克忒斯最后也是最杰出的弟子的我，也无法知晓明日破晓前自己注定要变成的可怖存在之名。因此，在这座俯瞰着永恒咆哮之海的、大师的云石宅邸里，我趁着银灯将熄的微光，以龙皮制成的珍贵古卷为纸，用蕴含魔力的墨水匆匆写下这篇手记。待书写完毕，我将把这些纸页封入奥利哈钢制成的圆筒，从高窗投入海中——以免我即将化作的怪物损毁这些文字。或许某日来自莱法拉的水手驾驶三列桨战船航向乌姆布与普尼奥时，会打捞起这个圆筒；又或是渔夫用细麻渔网从浪涛中将其拖起。读过我的故事后，世人将知晓真相并引以为戒；从此再无人敢靠近那座苍白的、被恶魔盘踞的阿维克忒斯之宅。\n\n六年来，我与年迈的大师离群索居，在对禁忌学识的研究中忘却了青春与俗世欲望。我们比所有前人都更深入地挖掘了那些被禁止的知识；破译了守护前人类公式的无钥象形文字；与史前亡者对话；召唤出密封墓穴与空间之外可怖深渊中的住民。鲜有人类子嗣愿意造访这片荒凉风蚀的峭壁；而那些来自时空遥远彼岸的访客虽不计其数，却皆无名无姓。\n\n我们栖居的宅邸如坟墓般森白肃穆，其古老程度超越亡者的记忆，建造者是人类还是恶魔早已湮灭在神话之外。下方黑色裸岩上，北海永无休止地攀爬咆哮，或如溃败的恶魔军团般退潮低吟；整座房屋永远回荡着海浪的凄厉回声，宛如空荡的墓穴；狂风在高塔周围愤怒哀嚎却无法撼动分毫。临海一侧的悬崖笔直垂落，其他方向则分布着狭窄的露台，上面生长着被海风压弯的畸形矮柏。巨型云石怪物守卫着陆路门户；庞大的云石女像镇守海面上方的柱廊；强力雕像与木乃伊遍布厅堂。除此之外，唯有我们召唤的灵体相伴；日常所需皆由巫妖与幽影侍奉。\n\n世人都知晓阿维克忒斯的威名——他是那位以黑石之塔统治苏斯兰的死灵法师马利格里斯唯一的在世弟子。马利格里斯死后多年仍被世人认为存活，腐烂的嘴唇依旧能吐出强力咒语与恐怖神谕。但阿维克忒斯不似其师般渴求世俗权力，学尽老巫师所授后便离开波塞冬尼斯城邦，寻求更宏大的统治。在阿维克忒斯晚年，我——青年法尔佩特隆获准加入他的隐居；自此我参与了他的苦修、守夜与召唤仪式……如今，我也必须分担那个应他召唤而来的诡异厄运。\n\n作为初学者的我，第一次见到响应阿维克忒斯召唤的可怖存在时，难免因凡人之躯而战栗：那些穿行于云石厅堂的，是大地与海洋、群星与天穹的精灵。黄铜香炉升腾的浓烟中，地底生物黑色触须的扭动令我发抖；当无形无状的灰色庞然秽物恶意挤满七色法阵边缘，威胁要对中央的我们施加不可名状的亵渎时，我在恐惧中尖叫。啜饮尸体斟满的酒浆、食用幽灵呈上的面包时，我无法抑制厌恶。但习惯终将消弭陌生与恐惧；久而久之我深信阿维克忒斯是统御一切咒法的君主，拥有无可违逆的遣散之力。\n\n若大师满足于来自亚特兰蒂斯与图勒、或姆大陆与玛雅潘的学识，对他与我都是幸事。这些本应足够：图勒的象牙书页上以血写就的符文能在行星升空时召唤第五与第七星球的恶魔；姆大陆的巫师记载了开启遥远未来之门的方法；我们的祖先亚特兰蒂斯人通晓原子间的路径与通往群星的道路，曾与太阳之灵对话。但阿维克忒斯渴求更黑暗的知识、更幽深的权柄；在我修习的第三年，失落蛇人的镜面铭板落入了他的手中。\n\n我们与铭板的相遇离奇如偶然。退潮时分，我们常沿洞穴暗梯前往宅邸后方峭壁环抱的月牙海滩。那里潮湿的暗沙上散落着异域海岸的奇异漂流物，或是飓风从无底深渊抛出的珍奇。我们曾在此寻得紫红相间的巨大贝壳、粗粝龙涎香与永恒绽放的珊瑚白花，甚至一尊来自极北群岛的青铜蛮族神像——某艘战船的艏饰像。\n\n一场撕裂深海的风暴过后，致命之日天空无云。当我们在退潮的海藻丛中发现那块闪耀如烈日般的铭板时，恶魔之风已在峭壁间沉寂，海浪如少女拖曳锦缎长裙般沙沙低语。我从浪沫中抢出这块三角形金属——它由某种永不锈蚀的无名金属制成，比人心更宽，一面光可鉴人，另一面蚀刻着扭曲符文。这些既非象形文字亦非已知字母的符号，其年代与来源我们无从推测。\n\n多年研究无果后，阿维克忒斯借助巫术召来史前巫师伊比斯的幽魂。通过古老的利莫里亚咒法，我们将这缕幽魂送往蛇人时代。归来的幽魂用濒临消散的声音告知了符文密钥。破译铭文后，我们发现这是蛇人巫师使用的召唤咒——但未言明召唤对象，亦无驱散之法。\n\n阿维克忒斯欣喜若狂，不顾我劝阻执意施法。在星象合宜之夜，我们于召唤厅绘制鸟血三角，分站两角，第三角由亚特兰蒂斯战士木乃伊奥伊戈斯镇守。当尸蜡火炬燃尽、奥伊戈斯掌中滑石与石棉被异火焚毁时，我们念出咒语。但除了无风的异样寂静，没有任何存在现身。\n\n就在我们以为仪式失败时，某个夏日午后，我在大理石露台上发现阿维克忒斯身后多了一道不属于任何柏树的阴影。这团如腐败脓液般流动的秽物呈现非人间的病态色泽，形似蹲伏头颅与蜿蜒长身的结合体。它如影随形地跟着大师，甚至在无光厅堂中依然可见。当这团阴影在午夜书斋里愈发逼近时，我终于向大师示警。\n\n阿维克忒斯凝视阴影后断言：\"这是蛇人咒语迟来的回应。\"我们重返召唤厅准备质询，却不知正迈向何等恐怖的真相。\n\n我们即刻踏入召灵密室，着手进行必要且力所能及的准备。正当我们欲施法问询时，那道诡秘暗影已愈发逼近阿维茨特的阴影，两者间仅余不足一根死灵法杖厚度的空隙。\n\n我们穷尽一切可行之法审问暗影，借由己身唇舌、木乃伊与雕像之口发声诘问。然未得确切回应；遂召唤惯常驱使的魔怪幽魂，令其代为传话，仍无果而终。其间所有魔镜皆未映出任何可能投射此影的存在；那些曾为我们代言的灵体亦宣称室内空无一物。似乎世间咒法皆无法对这来访者施以影响。阿维茨特终露忧色，遂以鲜血与灰烬在地面绘出乌摩尔禁魔椭圆——此域内邪魔精怪皆不得侵——退居其核心处。然暗影如腐败脓液般流泻而入，其阴影仍紧随阿维茨特之影，二者间距不过一柄巫师羽笔之厚。\n\n此刻阿维茨特面容已被恐惧刻满新纹，惨白汗珠缀满额间。因他与我皆知，此物超脱诸法常理，唯预兆灾厄不祥。他颤声向我呼告：\n\n\"吾对此物及其意图皆无所知，亦无力阻其进逼。速速离去，吾不欲令任何人目睹吾法术溃败及随之而来的厄运。趁尚有转圜之机，汝当远离此地，免遭暗影猎捕，被迫共担其险。\"\n\n虽恐惧已攫住吾灵魂深处，我仍不忍弃阿维茨特而去。然我曾立誓对其唯命是从；更自知对此幽影双重无力，因阿维茨特本人亦束手无策。\n\n遂含泪作别，战栗着退出这被诅咒的密室。回望门槛之际，我见那异质暗影如地板上蔓延的秽斑，已触及阿维茨特之影。霎时导师发出噩梦般的凄厉尖叫——其面容已非阿维茨特原貌，扭曲抽搐如遭无形梦魇折磨的疯人。我不敢再看，仓皇逃过幽暗外廊，穿越通往露台的高耸门廊。\n\n凶兆当空的赤红凸月低悬于露台与峭壁之上，雪松阴影在月光中诡谲延伸，于狂风中如巫师飘荡的斗篷起伏不定。我逆风弓身奔过露台，欲沿外部阶梯逃往屋后裂谷纵横的险径。恐惧催动双腿狂奔至露台边缘，却始终无法触及最上层台阶——脚下大理石竟如苍白地平线般随步伐不断退避。虽喘息不止全力冲刺，露台边际却始终遥不可及。\n\n最终我颓然放弃，意识到阿维茨特宅邸周遭空间已被未知咒术扭曲，陆路逃生绝无可能。听天由命折返宅邸时，但见月光倾泻的白色阶梯上，一道身影正于门廊处等候。仅凭那袭海紫长袍——而非其他特征——我认出那是阿维茨特。因其面容已非完整人形，化作令人作呕的流体混合物，掺杂着尘世难寻的异质。此般畸变较死亡或腐朽更为可怖，面部已浸透诡异暗影那不可名状的脓腐色泽，轮廓更与暗影臃肿侧影渐趋相似。其双手绝非世间造物，袍下躯体如蛆虫般恶心地延展蠕动，面庞与指节在月光下滴落着溶解状的腐败物质。而那穷追不舍的暗影，此刻已如浓稠溃烂的瘟疫，将阿维茨特之影腐蚀扭曲成难以言状的双重形态。\n\n我欲嘶喊却喉头凝噎，恐惧已榨干言语之泉。这曾是阿维茨特的存在沉默招手，腐烂的嘴唇未吐半字。它用已化作渗流秽物的双眼死死钉住我，以指间软烂的麻风触感紧攫我肩，领眩晕作呕的我穿过长廊，步入曾协助我们施展蛇人三重咒的奥伊戈斯及其同伴木乃伊所在的厅堂。\n\n永恒苍焰的灯盏下，可见众木乃伊倚墙而立，枯槁阴影各傍其身。但奥伊戈斯高大嶙峋的影迹旁，赫然伴着一道与折磨阿维茨特如出一辙的邪影。我忆起奥伊戈斯确曾参与仪式，跟随阿维茨特复诵过那段未知咒文——此刻恐怖正依次降临，死者亦难逃活人所受的荼毒。因我们狂妄召唤的秽暗无名之物，唯以此等方式向凡眼显形。我们无知启用禁忌咒文，将其从时空深渊中引出；而今它择时而至，将最极致的污秽烙印于召唤者之身。\n\n此后黑夜退潮，第二日如腐臭黏液般缓慢流逝……我目睹暗影与阿维茨特血肉阴影彻底融合……亦见证另一道暗影逐渐侵蚀奥伊戈斯枯瘦的形骸与焦黑躯体，将其转化为类似阿维茨特畸变的存在。我曾听闻木乃伊在阴影侵蚀下，如活人般发出剧痛恐惧的哀嚎，仿佛经历二次死亡。而今它已如另一具可怖存在归于沉寂，其思绪意图皆不可知……我实难断言降临之物是单一还是多重；亦不知其化身将止步于三位召唤者，抑或继续扩散。\n\n但这一切——以及更多可怖真相——我即将知晓：因现在轮到我被一道渐趋逼近的暗影追随。空气因无形恐惧凝结凝滞，旧日仆从魔怪皆逃离宅邸，大理石女像沿墙震颤不已。而曾是阿维茨特与奥伊戈斯的两个可怖存在却寸步不离，它们以非眼之眼静观默察，静候我亦堕入同类。此般静止比碎尸万段更令人胆寒。风中传来诡谲私语，海上响起异质咆哮，墙壁如薄纱般在遥远深渊的黑色吐息中战栗。\n\n知悉时辰无多，我将自己反锁藏书室写下此篇。已将那块导致灾祸的三角咒板抛入深海，唯愿后人永无觅得之日。此刻我必须收笔，将此文封入奥利哈钢筒投入波涛。因我的阴影与那可怖存在之影的间距正急剧缩短……其隙不过一柄巫师羽笔之厚。"

        "title_cn": "马利格里斯之死",
        "title": "The Death of Malygris",
        "content": "\n\nAt the hour of interlunar midnight, when lamps burned rarely and far apart in Susran, and slow-moving autumn clouds had muffled the stars, King Gadeiron sent forth into the sleeping city twelve of his trustiest mutes. Like shadows gliding through oblivion, they vanished upon their various ways; and each of them, returning presently to the darkened palace, led with him a shrouded figure no less discreet and silent than himself.\n\nIn this manner, groping along tortuous alleys, through blind cypress-caverns in the royal gardens, and down subterranean halls and steps, twelve of the most powerful sorcerers of Susran were brought together in a vault of oozing, death-gray granite, far beneath the foundations of the palace.\n\nThe entrance of the vault was guarded by earth-demons that obeyed the arch-sorcerer, Maranapion, who had long been the king's councillor. These demons would have torn limb from limb any who came unprepared to offer them a libation of fresh blood. The vault was lit dubiously by a single lamp, hollowed from a monstrous garnet, and fed with vipers' oil. Here Gadeiron, crownless, and wearing sackcloth dyed in sober purple, awaited the wizards on a seat of limestone wrought in the form of a sarcophagus. Maranapion stood at his right hand, immobile, and swathed to the mouth in the garments of the tomb. Before him was a tripod of orichalchum, rearing shoulder-high; and on the tripod, in a silver socket, there reposed the enormous blue eye of a slain Cyclops, wherein the archimage was said to behold weird visions. On this eye, gleaming balefully under the garnet lamp, the gaze of Maranapion was fixed with death-like rigidity.\n\nFrom these circumstances, the twelve sorcerers knew that the king had convened them only because of a matter supremely grave and secret. The hour and fashion of their summoning, the place of meeting, the terrible elemental guards, the mufti worn by Gadeiron — all were proof of a need for preternatural stealth and privity.\n\nFor awhile there was silence in the vault, and the twelve, bowing deferentially, waited the will of Gadeiron. Then, in a voice that was little more than a harsh whisper, the king spoke:\n\n\"What know ye of Malygris?\"\n\nHearing that awful name, the sorcerers paled and trembled visibly; but, one by one, as if speaking by rote, several of the foremost made answer to Gadeiron's question.\n\n\"Malygris dwells in his black tower above Susran,\" said the first. \"The night of his power is still heavy upon Poseidonis; and we others, moving in that night, are as shadows of a withered moon. He is overlord of all kings and sorcerers. Yea, even the triremes that fare to Tartessos, and the far-flown eagles of the sea, pass not beyond the black falling of his shadow.\"\n\n\"The demons of the five elements are his familiars,\" said the second. \"The gross eyes of common men have beheld them often, flying like birds about his tower, or crawling lizard-wise on the walls and pavements.\"\n\n\"Malygris sits in his high hall,\" avowed the third. \"Unto him, tribute is borne at the full moon from all the cities of Poseidonis. He takes a tithe of the lading of every galley. He claims a share of the silver and incense, of the gold and ivory sacred to the temples. His wealth is beyond the opulence of the sunken kings of Atlantis... even those kings who were thy forefathers, O Gadeiron.\"\n\n\"Malygris is old as the moon,\" mumbled a fourth. \"He will live for ever, armed against death with the dark magic of the moon. Death has become a slave in his citadel, toiling among other slaves, and striking only at the foes of Malygris.\"\n\n\"Much of this was true formerly,\" quoth the king, with a sinister hissing of his breath. \"But now a certain doubt has arisen... for it may be that Malygris is dead.\"\n\nA communicated shiver seemed to run about the assembly. \"Nay,\" said the sorcerer who had affirmed the immortality of Malygris. \"For how can this thing have come to pass? The doors of his tower stood open today at sunset; and the priests of the ocean-god, bearing a gift of pearls and purple dyes, went in before Malygris, and found him sitting in his tall chair of the ivory of mastodons. He received them haughtily, without speaking, as is his wont; and his servants, who are half ape and half man, came in unbidden to carry away the tribute.\"\n\n\"This very night,\" said another, \"I saw the stedfast lamps of the sable tower, burning above the city like the eyes of Taaran, god of Evil. The familiars have departed not from the tower as such beings depart at the dying of a wizard: for in that case, men would have heard their howling and lamentation in the dark.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" declared Gadeiron, \"men have been befooled ere this. And Malygris was ever the master of illuding shows, of feints, and beguilements. But there is one among us who discerns the truth. Maranapion, through the eye of the Cyclops, has looked on remote things and hidden places, Even now, he peers upon his ancient enemy, Malygris.\"\n\nMaranapion, shuddering a little beneath his shroud-like garments, seemed to return from his clairvoyant absorption. He raised from the tripod his eyes of luminous amber, whose pupils were black and impenetrable as jet.\n\n\"I have seen Malygris,\" he said, turning to the conclave. \"Many times I have watched him thus, thinking to learn some secret of his close-hidden magic, I have spied upon him at noon, at evenfall, and through the drear, lampless vigils of midnight. And I have beheld him in the ashen dawn and the dawn of quickening fire. But always he sits in the great ivory chair, in the high hall of his tower, frowning as if with meditation. And his hands clutch always the basilisk-carven arms of the chair, and his eyes turn evermore, unshutting, unblinking, toward the orient window and the heavens beyond where only high-risen stars and clouds go by.\n\n\"Thus have I beheld him for the space of a whole year and a month. And each day I have seen his monsters bring before him vessels filled with rare meat and drink: and later they have taken away the vessels untouched. And never have I discerned the least movement of his lips, nor any turning or tremor of his body.\n\n\"For these reasons, I deem that Malygris is dead; but by virtue of his supremacy in evil and in art magical, he sits defying the worm, still undecayed and incorrupt. And his monsters and his familiars attend him still, deceived by the lying appearance of life; and his power, though now an empty fraud, is still dark and awful upon Poseidonis.\"\n\nAgain, following the slow-measured words of Maranapion, there was silence in the vault. A dark, furtive triumph smoldered in the face of Gadeiron, on whom the yoke of Malygris had lain heavily, irking his pride. Among the twelve sorcerers, there was none who wished well to Malygris, nor any who did not fear him; and they received the annunciation of his demise with dreadful, half-incredulous joy. Some there were who doubted, holding that Maranapion was mistaken; and in the faces of all, as in somber mirrors, their awe of the master was still reflected.\n\nMaranapion, who had hated Malygris above all others, as the one warlock whose art and power excelled his own, stood aloof and inscrutable like a poising vulture.\n\nIt was King Gadeiron who broke the gravid silence.\n\n\"Not idly have I called ye to this crypt, O sorcerers of Susran: for a work remains to be done. Verily, shall the corpse of a dead necromancer tyrannize over us all? There is mystery here, and a need to move cautiously, for the duration of his necromancy is yet unverified and untested. But I have called ye together in order that the hardiest among ye may take council with Maranapion, and aid him in devising such wizardry as will now expose the fraud of Malygris, and evince his mortality to all men, as well as to the fiends that follow him still, and the ministering monsters.\"\n\nA babble of disputation rose, and they who were most doubtful of this matter, and feared to work against Malygris in any fashion, begged Gadeiron's leave to withdraw. In the end, there remained seven of the twelve...\n\nSwiftly, by dim and covert channels, on the day that followed, the death of Malygris was bruited throughout the isle Poseidonis. Many disbelieved the story, for the might of the wizard was a thing seared as with hot iron on the souls of them that had witnessed his thaumaturgies. However, it was recalled that during the past year few had beheld him face to face; and always he had seemed to ignore them, speaking not, and staring fixedly through the tower window, as if intent on far things that were veiled to others. During that time, he had called no man to his presence, and had sent forth no message, no oracle or decree; and they who had gone before him were mainly bearers of tribute and had followed a long-established custom.\n\nWhen these matters became generally known, there were some who maintained that he sat thus in a long swoon of ecstasy or catalepsy, and would awaken therefrom in time. Others, however, held that he had died, and was able to preserve the deceitful aspect of life through a spell that endured after him. No man dared to enter the tall, sable tower; and still the shadow of the tower fell athwart Susran like the shadow of an evil gnomon moving on some disastrous dial; and still the umbrage of the power of Malygris lay stagnant as the tomb's night on the minds of men.\n\nNow, among the five sorcerers who had begged Gadeiron's leave to depart, fearing to join their fellows in the making of wizardry against Malygris, there were two that plucked heart a little afterward, when they heard from other sources a confirmation of the vision beheld by Maranapion through the Cyclop's eye.\n\nThese two were brothers, named Nygon and Fustules. Feeling a certain shame for their timidity, and desiring to rehabilitate themselves in the regard of the others, they conceived an audacious plan.\n\nWhen night had again fallen upon the city, bringing no moon, but only obscure stars and the scud of sea-born clouds, Nygon and Fustules went forth through the darkened ways and came to the steep hill at the heart of Susran, whereon, in half-immemorial years, Malygris had established his grim citadel.\n\nThe hill was wooded with close-grown cypresses, whose foliage, even to the full sun, was black and sombre as if tarnished by wizard fumes. Crouching on either hand, they leaned like misshapen spirits of the night above the stairs of adamant that gave access to the tower. Nygon and Fustules, mounting the stairs, cowered and trembled when the boughs swung menacingly toward them in violent gusts of wind. They felt the dripping of heavy sea-dews, blown in their faces like a spittle of demons. The wood, it seemed, was full of execrably sighing voices, and weird whimpers and little moanings as of imp-children astray from Satanic dams.\n\nThe lights of the tower burned through the waving boughs, and seemed to recede unapproachably as they climbed. More than once the two regretted their temerity, but at length, without suffering palpable harm or hindrance, they neared the portals, which stood eternally open, pouring the effulgence of still, unflaring lamps on the windy darkness.\n\nThough the plan they had conceived was nefarious, they deemed it best to enter boldly. The purpose of their visit if any should challenge or interrogate them was the asking of an oracle from Malygris, who was famed throughout the isle as the most infallible of soothsayers.\n\nFreshening momentarily from the sea beyond Susran, the wind clamored about the tower like an army of devils in flight from deep to deep, and the long mantles of the sorcerers were blown in their faces. But, entering the wide portals, they heard no longer the crying of the gale, and felt no more its pursuing rudeness. At a single step they passed into mausolean silence. Around them the lamplight fell unshaken on caryatids of black marble, on mosaics of precious gems, on fabulous metals and many-storied tapestries; and a tideless perfume weighed upon the air like a balsam of death. They felt an involuntary awe, deeming the mortal stillness a thing that was hardly natural. But, seeing that the tower vestibule was unguarded by any of the creatures of Malygris, they were emboldened to go on and climb the marmorean stairs to the apartments above.\n\nEverywhere, by the light of opulent lamps, they beheld inestimable and miraculous treasures. There were tables of ebony wrought with sorcerous runes of pearl and white coral; webs of silver and samite, cunningly pictured; caskets of electrum overflowing with talismanic jewels; tiny gods of jade and agate; and tall chryselephantine demons. Here was the loot of ages, lying heaped and mingled in utter negligence, without lock or ward, as if free for any casual thief.\n\nEyeing the riches about them with covetous wonder, the two sorcerers mounted slowly from room to room, unchallenged and unmolested, and came ultimately to that upper hall in which Malygris was wont to receive his visitors.\n\nHere, as elsewhere, the portals stood open before them, and lamps burned as if in a trance of light. The lust of plunder was hot in their hearts. Made bolder still by the seeming desolation, and thinking now that the tower was uninhabited by any but the dead magician, they went in with little hesitancy.\n\nLike the rooms below, the chamber was full of precious artifacts; and iron-bound volumes and brazen books of occult, tremendous necromancy, together with golden and earthen censers, and vials of unshatterable crystal, were strewn in weird confusion about the mosaic floor. At the very center there sat the old archimage in his chair of primeval ivory, peering with stark, immovable eyes at the night-black window.\n\nNygon and Fustules felt their awe return upon them, remembering too clearly now the thrice-baleful mastery that this man had wielded, and the demon lore he had known, and the spells he had wrought that were irrefragable by other wizards. The specters of these things rose up before them as if by a final necromancy. With down-dropped eyes and humble mien, they went forward, bowing reverentially. Then, speaking aloud, in accordance with their predetermined plan, Fustules requested an oracle of their fortunes from Malygris.\n\nThere was no answer, and lifting their eyes, the brothers were greatly reassured by the aspect of the seated ancient. Death alone could have set the grayish pallor on the brow, could have locked the lips in a rigor as of fast-frozen clay. The eyes were like cavern-shadowed ice, holding no other light than a vague reflection of the lamps. Under the beard that was half silver, half sable, the cheeks had already fallen in as with beginning decay, showing the harsh outlines of the skull. The gray and hideously shrunken hands, whereon the eyes of enchanted beryls and rubies burned, were clenched inflexibly on the chair-arms which had the form of arching basilisks.\n\n\"Verily,\" murmured Nygon, \"there is naught here to frighten or dismay us. Behold, it is only the lich of an old man after all, and one that has cheated the worm of his due provender overlong.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Fustules. \"But this man, in his time, was the greatest of all necromancers. Even the ring on his little finger is a sovereign talisman. The balas-ruby of the thumbring of his right hand will conjure demons from out of the deep. In the volumes that lie about the chamber, there are secrets of perished gods and the mysteries of planets immemorial. In the vials, there are sirups that give strange visions, and philtres that can revive the dead. Among these things, it is ours to choose freely.\"\n\nNygon, eyeing the gems greedily, selected a ring that encircled the right forefinger with the sixfold coils of a serpent of orichalchum, bearing in its mouth a beryl shaped like a griffin's egg. Vainly, however, he tried to loosen the finger from its rigid clutch on the chair-arm, to permit the removal of the ring. Muttering impatiently, he drew a knife from his girdle and prepared to hew away the finger. In the meanwhile, Fustules had drawn his own knife as a preliminary before approaching the other hand.\n\n\"Is thy heart firm within thee, brother?\" he inquired in a sort of sibilant whisper. \"If so, there is even more to be gained than these talismanic rings. It is well known that a wizard who attains to such supremacy as Malygris, undergoes by virtue thereof a complete bodily transformation, turning his flesh into elements more subtle than those of common flesh. And whoso eats of his flesh even so much as a tiny morsel will share thereafter in the powers owned by the wizard.\"\n\nNygon nodded as he bent above the chosen finger. \"This, too, was in my thought,\" he answered.\n\nBefore he or Fustules could begin their ghoulish attack, they were startled by a venomous hissing that appeared to emanate from the bosom of Malygris. They drew back in amazement and consternation, while a small coral viper slid from behind the necromancer's beard, and glided swiftly over his knees to the floor like a sinuous rill of scarlet. There, coiling as if to strike, it regarded the thieves with eyes that were cold and malignant as drops of frozen poison.\n\n\"By the black thorns of Taaran!\" cried FustuIes. \"It is one of Malygris' familiars. I have heard of this viper--\"\n\nTurning, the two would have fled from the room. But, even as they turned, the walls and portals seemed to recede before them, fleeing giddily and interminably, as if unknown gulfs had been admitted to the chamber. A vertigo seized them; reeling, they saw the little segments of mosaic under their feet assume the proportions of mighty flags. Around them the strewn books and censers and vials loomed enormous, rearing above their heads and barring their way as they ran.\n\nNygon, looking over his shoulder, saw that the viper had turned to a vast python, whose crimson coils were undulating swiftly along the floor. In a colossal chair, beneath lamps that were large as suns, there sat the colossal form of the dead archimage, in whose presence Nygon and Fustules were no more than pigmies. The lips of Malygris were still immobile beneath his beard; and his eyes still glared implacably upon the blackness of the far window. But at that instant a voice filled the awful spaces of the room, reverberating like thunder in the heavens, hollow and tremendous:\n\n\"Fools! ye have dared to ask me for an oracle. And the oracle is — death!\"\n\nNygon and Fustules, knowing their doom, fled on in a madness of terror and desperation. Beyond the towering thuribles, the tomes that were piled like pyramids, they saw the threshold in intermittent glimpses, like a remote horizon. It withdrew before them, dim and unattainable. They panted as runners pant in a dream. Behind them, the vermilion python crawled; and overtaking them as they tried to round the brazen back of a wizard volume, it struck them down like fleeing dormice...\n\nIn the end, there was only a small coral viper, that crept back to its hiding-place in the bosom of Malygris...\n\nToiling by day and night, in the vaults under the palace of Gadeiron, with impious charms and unholy conjurations, and fouler chemistries, Maranapion and his seven coadjutors had nearly completed the making of their sorcery.\n\nThey designed an invultuation against Malygris that would break the power of the dead necromancer by rendering evident to all the mere fact of his death. Employing an unlawful Atlantean science, Maranapion had created living plasm with all the attributes of human flesh, and had caused it to grow and flourish, fed with blood. Then he and his assistants, uniting their wills and convoking the forces that were blasphemy to summon, had compelled the shapeless, palpitating mass to put forth the limbs and members of a new-born child; and had formed it ultimately, after all the changes that man would undergo between birth and senescence, into an image of Malygris.\n\nNow, carrying the process even further, they caused the simulacrum to die of extreme age, as Malygris had apparently died. It sat before them in a chair, facing toward the east, and duplicating the very posture of the magician on his seat of ivory.\n\nNothing remained to be done. Forspent and weary, but hopeful, the sorcerers waited for the first signs of mortal decay in the image. If the spells they had woven were successful, a simultaneous decay would occur in the body of Malygris, incorruptible heretofore. Inch by inch, member by member, he would rot in the adamantine tower; His familiars would desert him, no longer deceived; and all who came to the tower would know his mortality; and the tyranny of Malygris would lift from Susran, and his necromancy be null and void as a broken pentacle in sea-girt Poseidonis.\n\nFor the first time since the beginning of their invultuation, the eight magicians were free to intermit their vigilance without peril of invalidating the charm. They slept soundly, feeling that their repose was well earned. On the morrow they returned, accompanied by King Gadeiron, to the vault in which they had left the plasmic image.\n\nOpening the sealed door, they were met by a charnel odor, and were gratified to perceive in the figure the unmistakable signs of decomposition. A little later, by consulting the Cyclops' eye, Maranapion verified the paralleling of these marks in the features of Malygris.\n\nA great jubilation, not unmingled with relief, was felt by the sorcerers and by King Gadeiron. Heretofore, not knowing the extent and duration of the powers wielded by the dead master, they had been doubtful of the efficacy of their own magic. But now, it seemed, there was no longer any reason for doubt.\n\nOn that very day it happened that certain seafaring merchants went before Malygris to pay him, according to custom, a share of the profits of their latest voyage. Even as they bowed in the presence of the master, they became aware, by sundry disagreeable tokens, that they had borne tribute to a corpse. Not daring even then to refuse the long-exacted toll, they flung it down and fled from the place in terror.\n\nSoon, in all Susran, there was none who doubted any longer the death of Malygris. And yet, such was the awe he had wrought through many lustrums, that few were venturous enough to invade the tower; and thieves were wary, and would not try to despoil its fabled treasures.\n\nDay by day, in the blue, monstrous eye of the Cyclops, Maranapion saw the rotting of his dreaded rival. And upon him presently there came a strong desire to visit the tower and behold face to face that which he had witnessed only in vision. Thus alone would his triumph be complete.\n\nSo it was that he and the sorcerers who had aided him, together with King Gadeiron, went up to the sable tower by the steps of adamant, and climbed by the marble stairs, even as Nygon and Fustules before them, to the high room in which Malygris was seated... But the doom of Nygon and Fustules, being without other witnesses than the dead, was wholly unknown to them.\n\nBoldly and with no hesitation they entered the chamber. Slanting through the western window, the sun of late afternoon fell goldenly on the dust that had gathered everywhere. Spiders had woven their webs on the bright-jeweled censers, on the graven lamps, and the metal-covered volumes of sorcery. The air was stagnant with a stifling foulness of death.\n\nThe intruders went forward, feeling that impulse which leads the victors to exult over a vanquished enemy. Malygris sat unbowed and upright, his black and tattered fingers clutching the ivory chair-arms as of yore, and his empty orbits glowering still at the eastern window. His face was little more than a bearded skull; and his blackening brow was like worm-pierced ebony.\n\n\"O Malygris, I give thee greeting,\" said Maranapion in a loud voice of mockery. \"Grant, I beseech thee, a sign, if thy wizardry still prevails, and hath not become the appanage of oblivion.\"\n\n\"Greeting, O Maranapion,\" replied a grave and terrible voice that issued from the maggot-eaten lips. \"Indeed, I will grant thee a sign. Even as I, in death, have rotted upon my seat from the foul sorcery which was wrought in the vaults of King Gadeiron, so thou and thy fellows and Gadeiron, living, shall decay and putrefy wholly in an hour, by virtue of the curse that I put upon ye now.\"\n\nThen the shrunken corpse of Malygris, fulminating the runes of an old Atlantean formula, cursed the eight sorcerers and King Gadeiron. The formula, at frequent intervals, was cadenced with fatal names of lethal gods; and in it were told the secret appellations of the black god of time, and the Nothingness that abides beyond time; and use was made of the titles of many tomb-lairing demons. Heavy and hollow-sounding were the runes, and in them one seemed to hear a noise of great blows on sepulchral doors, and a clangor of downfallen slabs. The air darkened as if with the hovering of seasonless night, and thereupon, like a breathing of the night, a chillness entered the chamber; and it seemed that the black wings of ages passed over the tower, beating prodigiously from void to void, ere the curse was done.\n\nHearing that maranatha, the sorcerers were dumb with the extremity of their dread; and even Maranapion could recall no counter-spell effectual in any degree against it. All would have fled from the room ere the curse ended, but a mortal weakness was upon them, and they felt a sickness as of quick-coming death. Shadows were woven athwart their eyes; but through the shadows, each beheld dimly the instant blackening of the faces of his fellows, and saw the cheeks fall ruinously, and the lips curl back on the teeth like those of long-dead cadavers.\n\nTrying to run, each was aware of his own limbs that rotted beneath him, pace by pace, and felt the quick sloughing of his flesh in corruption from the bone. Crying out with tongues that shriveled ere the cry was done, they fell down on the floor of the chamber. Life lingered in them, together with the dire knowledge of their doom, and they preserved something of hearing and sight. In the dark agony of their live corruption, they tossed feebly to and fro, and crawled inchmeal on the chill mosaic. And they still moved in this fashion, slowly and more imperceptibly, till their brains were turned to gray mold, and the sinews were parted from their bones, and the marrow was dried up.\n\nThus, in an hour, the curse was accomplished. The enemies of the necromancer lay before him, supine and shrunken, in the tomb's final posture, as if doing obeisance to a seated Death. Except for the garments, none could have told King Gadeiron from Maranapion, nor Maranapion from the lesser wizards.\n\nThe day went by, declining seaward; and, burning like a royal pyre beyond Susran the sunset flung an aureate glare through the window, and then dropped away in red brands and funereal ashes. And in the twilight a coral viper glided from the bosom of Malygris, and weaving among the remnant of them that lay on the floor, and slipping silently down the stairs of marble, it passed forever from the tower.",

"在月晦时分的午夜，当苏斯兰城中灯火寥落、秋云缓移遮蔽群星之际，加德隆王派出了十二名最可靠的哑仆潜入沉睡的城池。他们如同滑入虚无的阴影，各自消失在蜿蜒街巷中；不久后，每人都引领着一位与他们同样隐秘无声的蒙面身影返回幽暗王宫。\n\n就这样，十二位苏斯兰最强大的巫师穿过曲折小巷、御花园中如洞穴般幽暗的柏树林，沿着地下厅堂与阶梯，最终聚集在宫殿地基深处一间渗着死灰色花岗岩汁液的密室中。\n\n密室入口由大地恶魔把守，它们听命于长期担任国王顾问的大法师玛拉纳皮昂。任何未备新鲜血祭之人都会被它们撕成碎片。密室仅靠一盏从巨型石榴石中凿出的油灯照明，灯油取自毒蛇的脂肪。加德隆王未戴冠冕，身披染着暗紫的粗麻衣，坐在石灰石雕成的石棺状座位上等候众巫师。玛拉纳皮昂裹着裹尸布般的衣袍直掩到唇边，如雕像般伫立其右。他面前耸立着齐肩高的山铜三足架，银质凹槽中嵌着一颗被宰杀的独眼巨人之眼——据说大法师能从中窥见诡谲幻象。在石榴石灯恶毒的光芒下，玛拉纳皮昂死寂般的目光正凝固在这颗泛着幽蓝的眼球上。\n\n见此情形，十二巫师明白国王召集他们必是为处理极端重大且隐秘之事。召集的时辰与方式、会面地点、可怖的元素守卫、加德隆的简朴装束——无不昭示着需要超乎寻常的隐秘行动。\n\n密室中沉寂片刻，十二人恭敬鞠躬等候王命。终于，国王用沙哑的耳语声开口：\n\n\"你们对马利格里斯知道多少？\"\n\n听闻这个可怕的名字，巫师们面色惨白浑身战栗。但其中几位为首者仍如诵经般依次作答：\n\n\"马利格里斯居于苏斯兰上方的黑塔中，\"第一人说，\"他的力量之夜仍笼罩着波塞冬尼斯；我们这些在夜色中行走之人，不过如枯月投下的阴影。他是诸王与巫师的主宰。就连驶向塔特索斯的战船、远翔的海鹰，都飞不出他黑影的笼罩范围。\"\n\n\"五大元素的恶魔皆是他使魔，\"第二人说道，\"凡俗之眼常目睹它们如飞鸟绕塔盘旋，或蜥蜴般在墙垣路面爬行。\"\n\n\"马利格里斯端坐高厅，\"第三人宣称，\"波塞冬尼斯诸城每逢满月皆向他进贡。他抽取每艘商船货物的什一税，索要神庙供奉的银器、熏香、黄金与象牙。其财富超越沉没的亚特兰蒂斯诸王...即便是您的先祖，加德隆王。\"\n\n\"马利格里斯古老如月，\"第四人含糊道，\"他将借月之黑魔法永生不死。死亡已成其城堡中的奴隶，只为马利格里斯的敌人挥镰。\" \n\n\"这些昔日或许属实，\"国王吐息中带着险恶的嘶嘶声，\"但如今存疑...因马利格里斯或许已死。\"\n\n一阵战栗掠过众人。\"不可能，\"曾断言马利格里斯不朽的巫师反驳，\"今日日落时他塔门洞开；海神祭司进献珍珠紫染料时，仍见他端坐在乳齿象牙高椅上。他如常傲慢地沉默受礼，那些人猿混血的仆从仍会自行收走贡品。\"\n\n\"就在今夜，\"另一人说，\"我还见黑塔灯火如邪神塔兰之眼悬于城上。使魔未如巫师临终时那般离去——否则人们早该听见它们在黑暗中的哀嚎。\"\n\n\"呵，\"加德隆断言，\"世人曾被愚弄。马利格里斯最擅幻象欺瞒。但我们中有人已窥见真相。玛拉纳皮昂通过独眼巨人之眼，看见了隐秘之事。此刻他正凝视宿敌马利格里斯。\"\n\n裹尸布下的玛拉纳皮昂微微战栗，似从透视状态中回归。他抬起琥珀色眼眸，瞳孔如黑玉般深不可测。\n\n\"我看见了马利格里斯，\"他转向众人，\"一年零一月来，我屡次观察他企图破解其秘术。无论正午、黄昏、无灯的午夜守夜时分，还是灰烬般的黎明与火红晨曦中——他始终端坐塔厅象牙椅上，似在冥想般蹙眉。双手紧抓雕有蛇怪纹的扶手，永不闭合的双眼始终望向东方窗外的云天，唯有高悬的星辰流云经过。\"\n\n\"每日我见他那些怪物呈上珍馐美酒，又原封不动撤走。从未见他嘴唇翕动，身躯有丝毫动作。\"\n\n\"因此我断定马利格里斯已死；但凭借至邪魔法，他仍端坐抗腐。使魔与怪物被虚假的生命表象所骗继续侍奉。其力量虽成空壳，仍如阴云笼罩波塞冬尼斯。\"\n\n玛拉纳皮昂话音落下，密室重归死寂。加德隆脸上燃起阴郁的窃喜——马利格里斯的枷锁长久刺痛着他的骄傲。十二巫师中无人对马利格里斯怀有善意，亦无人不畏惧他。听闻其死讯，众人既惊骇又暗喜。有人怀疑玛拉纳皮昂判断有误，但所有人眼中仍映着对那位大师的敬畏。\n\n玛拉纳皮昂——这个最憎恨马利格里斯的巫师，因其术法超越自己——如秃鹫般阴鸷而立。\n\n最终加德隆王打破凝重的沉默：\n\n\"苏斯兰的巫师们，我召你们来此墓穴非为虚务。岂容一具死灵法师的尸骸继续统治我们？此事诡谲需谨慎，但其死灵术的持续尚未验证。望你们中最勇毅者能与玛拉纳皮昂共商对策，设计揭穿马利格里斯的骗局，向仍追随他的恶魔怪物昭示其凡人之躯。\"\n\n争论声四起。最怀疑此事、不敢对抗马利格里斯的五人请求告退。最终留下七人......\n\n次日，马利格里斯死讯通过隐秘渠道迅速传遍波塞冬尼斯全岛。许多人不信，因目睹过其神迹者灵魂上皆烙着恐惧的烙印。但人们忆起近一年来鲜少有人面见他，他总是沉默凝望塔窗，似在注视他人不可见的远方。期间他未召见任何人，未发布神谕政令，仅按旧制接受贡品。\n\n消息传开后，有人认为他处于狂喜或强直性昏厥，终将苏醒。更多人则认为他已死，仅靠延续的咒术维持假象。无人敢踏入那座高耸黑塔，其阴影仍如厄运日晷的指针笼罩苏斯兰。马利格里斯的威压如墓夜般滞重地压在人们心头。\n\n先前因畏惧而退出的五名巫师中，有两人——兄弟尼冈与法斯图勒斯——听闻玛拉纳皮昂通过巨人之眼所见景象得到印证后，重拾了些许勇气。\n\n为洗刷怯懦之耻，他们策划了一个大胆计划。\n\n当无月的黑夜再度降临，唯有晦暗星辰与海云疾驰时，这对兄弟潜入暗巷，来到苏斯兰中心陡峭的山丘——马利格里斯在远古年代建立的可怖城堡所在地。\n\n山丘密布着柏树林，其叶即使在烈日下也如被巫术熏染般漆黑。它们如畸形的夜之精灵蜷伏在通往黑塔的钢玉阶梯两侧。兄弟俩攀爬时，狂风中威胁般摇摆的枝丫令他们瑟缩颤抖。恶魔唾沫般的沉重海露拍打在脸上。林中仿佛充满诅咒的叹息、诡异的呜咽，如同迷失的魔婴在啜泣。\n\n高塔的灯火穿透摇曳的枝桠，在他们攀登时仿佛退向遥不可及的远方。两位术士不止一次懊悔自己的鲁莽，但最终毫发无损地接近了那扇永恒洞开的门扉——静止无焰的灯光正将辉煌倾泻在呼啸的黑暗中。\n\n尽管他们谋划的勾当邪恶至极，却认定昂首而入方为上策。若有人盘诘，便谎称前来向全岛最灵验的预言者马雷格里斯求取神谕。\n\n自苏斯兰外海袭来的狂风时而加剧，如一群在深渊间逃窜的恶魔般拍打着塔身，术士们的长袍被吹得蒙住面孔。但踏入宽阔门廊的刹那，风嚎与粗粝的追逐感骤然消失。一步之间，他们已置身陵墓般的死寂。摇曳的灯光映照着黑大理石女像柱、宝石镶嵌画、传说中的金属与层层叠叠的挂毯；凝滞的香气如死亡香膏般悬浮空中。这不自然的寂静令他们不寒而栗，但见前厅竟无马雷格里斯的爪牙把守，便壮着胆子登上云石阶梯。\n\n在奢华的灯盏下，处处堆砌着无价的奇迹：饰有珍珠符文的乌木桌、银线织锦、溢出护符宝石的琥珀匣、玉石雕琢的微型神像、黄金象牙制成的高大恶魔。这些时代的战利品被随意弃置，仿佛专候盗贼光临。\n\n两位术士贪婪地扫视珍宝，逐层而上，最终来到马雷格里斯惯常接待访客的顶层大厅。此处门户同样洞开，灯火如入定般静止。掠夺的欲望在他们血管里灼烧。见四下荒芜，他们断定塔中除死去的法师外再无活物，便大步踏入。\n\n与下层相同，厅内充斥着珍贵器物：铁箍典籍、黄铜秘法书、金银香炉与不碎水晶瓶在镶嵌地板上散落成诡异的阵列。正中央，年迈的大法师端坐于远古象牙椅上，僵直的眼珠凝视着漆黑的窗户。\n\n尼冈与法斯图勒斯顿生敬畏，想起此人曾执掌三重灾厄的权柄，通晓恶魔学识，其咒语连其他巫师都无法破解。这些记忆如最后的死灵法术般浮现。他们垂首躬身，按计划高声向马雷格里斯求问命运。\n\n没有回应。抬眼细看，椅上老者的形貌令他们释然——唯有死亡能将灰白死气覆上他的额头，将双唇封入冻土般的僵直。冰窟般的眼珠仅反射着微弱的灯光。半银半黑的胡须下，凹陷的面颊已显露出颅骨轮廓。戴着咒术宝石的枯手如铁钳般紧扣椅臂上弓起的蛇怪雕饰。\n\n\"不过一具老朽的尸骸，\"尼冈低语，\"连蛆虫都嫌弃的腐肉罢了。\"\n\n\"但他生前是最伟大的死灵法师，\"法斯图勒斯指向那些戒指，\"小指上的指环是至高护符，拇指红玉能召唤深渊恶魔。这些书卷记载着湮灭神祇的奥秘，瓶中药水可唤起亡魂。我们尽可取用。\"\n\n尼冈贪婪地盯着缠绕食指的六重金蛇戒——蛇口衔着狮鹫蛋形状的绿玉。当他试图掰开僵硬的手指时，不耐烦地抽出短刀。法斯图勒斯也拔刀向另一只手逼近。\n\n\"兄弟，\"他嘶声道，\"传说这等境界的巫师，肉身已蜕变为超凡物质。食其血肉者，可继承其法力。\"\n\n尼冈点头：\"正合我意。\"\n\n突然一阵恶毒的嘶声自马雷格里斯胸前传来。他们惊退之际，一条珊瑚小蛇从法师胡须后游出，如猩红溪流般滑落地面，盘身昂首，冷眼如凝固的毒液。\n\n\"塔兰的黑棘啊！\"法斯图勒斯惊呼，\"这是他的使魔！\"\n\n二人转身欲逃，却发现墙壁门廊竟在眼前无限延展。脚下的镶嵌地砖化作巨碑，散落的器物如山岳般拔地而起阻住去路。尼冈回头看见小蛇已变成巨蟒，猩红躯干在地面翻涌。\n\n在宛如烈日的灯盏下，死去的法师此刻庞然如神祇，而他们渺小如侏儒。马雷格里斯的嘴唇依旧紧闭，目光仍锁着远窗的黑暗。但此刻一个雷霆般的声音响彻厅堂：\n\n\"愚者！尔等所求神谕便是——死亡！\"\n\n在疯狂逃窜中，他们看见门槛如地平线般遥不可及。赤红巨蟒追上试图绕过青铜书脊的二人，如同扑杀仓鼠般将其击倒......\n\n最终只有一条珊瑚小蛇，蠕动着钻回马雷格里斯的衣襟。\n\n在加德隆宫的地窖里，马拉纳皮翁与七名助手日夜不休地施展渎神咒语，进行着更肮脏的炼金术。他们即将完成针对马雷格里斯的诅咒——通过向世人证明其死亡来破除他的力量。\n\n运用禁忌的亚特兰蒂斯秘术，他们培育出具有血肉特性的活质，以鲜血喂养使其生长。通过合力召唤亵渎之力，迫使这团颤动的肉块经历从婴儿到老朽的蜕变，最终塑成马雷格里斯的仿制品。\n\n此刻他们令仿制品如原主般\"老死\"。它面东而坐，与象牙椅上的法师姿态完全相同。\n\n精疲力竭的术士们等待仿制品出现腐烂迹象。若咒语生效，马雷格里斯不朽的肉身将同步腐朽。他的使魔会离去，世人将知晓他已死去，他对苏斯兰的统治会如沉没的波塞多尼斯岛上破碎的五芒星般消散。\n\n八位法师首次安心入睡。次日他们与加德隆国王重返地窖，开启密封门时迎面扑来尸臭。仿制品确已开始分解，通过独眼巨人水晶的验证，马雷格里斯的真身亦如是。\n\n众人欢欣鼓舞。当日恰有商人按惯例前来进贡，行礼时惊觉自己竟在向尸体献祭。他们丢下贡品仓皇逃窜。\n\n很快全苏斯兰都确信了马雷格里斯的死讯。但数十载积威之下，仍无人敢擅闯高塔，连盗贼都对传说中的宝藏望而却步。\n\n日复一日，马兰纳皮翁从那独眼巨人般幽蓝可怖的瞳孔里，目睹了他那可怕对手的腐朽进程。此刻，一股强烈的欲望攫住了他——他要亲临那座高塔，直面那个仅在幻象中得见的可怖存在。唯有如此，他的胜利才算圆满。\n\n于是他与助阵的巫师们，连同加德隆国王，沿着黑曜石阶梯登上那座漆黑高塔。当他们如先前的尼冈与法斯图尔斯那般，攀上大理石台阶来到顶层房间时，只见马利格里斯仍端坐其中......只是尼冈与法斯图尔斯的下场，因除死者外无人见证，他们全然不知。\n\n众人毫不迟疑地闯入内室。西窗斜照的暮色将金辉泼洒在积尘之上，蛛网覆满了镶宝香炉、雕纹灯盏与包金咒术典籍。凝滞的空气中翻涌着令人窒息的腐臭。\n\n闯入者们向前逼近，怀着胜利者凌虐败寇的冲动。马利格里斯依旧挺直身躯，漆黑枯朽的手指如往昔般紧握象牙椅臂，空洞眼窝仍死死瞪着东窗。他的面容已近乎髑髅，生须的下颌与遭虫蛀蚀的乌木前额构成骇人对比。\n\n\"噢，马利格里斯，我来问候你了。\"马兰纳皮翁高声嘲弄道，\"若汝巫术犹存，未随遗忘湮灭，恳请赐予征兆。\"\n\n\"问候你，马兰纳皮翁。\"蛆虫啃噬的唇间吐出森然回应，\"吾必赐汝征兆。正如吾因加德隆地窖所施邪术而腐于座，汝等与加德隆亦将在一小时内活生生溃烂——此乃吾此刻所降诅咒。\"\n\n马利格里斯的干尸随即吟诵起亚特兰蒂斯古咒，八名巫师与加德隆王顿遭诅咒。咒文中不时夹杂致命神祇的真名，揭示了时光黑神与虚空之外\"虚无\"的隐秘称谓，更召唤了无数墓穴恶魔。沉郁的咒语在石室回荡，恍若墓门遭巨力叩击、石碑轰然倾塌的声响。\n\n空气骤然晦暗如永夜降临，刺骨寒意随之渗入厅堂。在诅咒完成前，众人仿佛听见无数纪元的黑翼掠过塔楼，在虚空间掀起滔天巨浪。\n\n听闻这灭顶之咒，巫师们因极度恐惧而失语，连马兰纳皮翁也忆不起任何有效反咒。未等咒语念完，众人便欲逃离，却觉死兆般的虚弱袭来。阴影在他们眼前交织，朦胧中彼此目睹对方面容急速灰败，双颊塌陷如陈年尸骸。\n\n试图奔逃时，每个人都惊觉自己的肢体正逐步腐坏，血肉正从骨骼上剥落。未及发出完整的惨叫，他们便纷纷栽倒在地。生命与对厄运的清醒认知仍在延续，尚存些许视听之能。在这活体腐败的黑暗痛苦中，他们微弱抽搐着，在冰冷马赛克地砖上蠕行。直至脑髓化作灰霉，肌腱脱离白骨，骨髓枯竭殆尽，这些可怖蠕动才彻底停止。\n\n一小时内，诅咒应验。死灵法师的敌人们以墓穴永恒的姿势匍匐在他座前，恍若向端坐的死神朝拜。若非衣着差异，无人能辨加德隆王与马兰纳皮翁，或马兰纳皮翁与寻常术士的区别。\n\n夕阳如皇家火葬堆在西苏斯兰燃烧，将鎏金光焰投入高窗，最终化作猩红余烬没入海平线。暮色中，一条珊瑚毒蛇从马利格里斯怀中游出，蜿蜒穿过地上那些残余物，悄然滑下大理石阶，永远离开了这座高塔。"

        "content": "\n\nWith no other light than that of the four diminutive moons of Xiccarph, each in a different phase but all decrescent, Tiglari had crossed the bottomless swamp of Soorm, wherein no reptile dwelt and no dragon descended - but where the pitch-black ooze was alive with continual heavings and writhings. He had carefully avoided the high causey of white corundum that spanned the fen, and had threaded his way with infinite peril from isle to sedgy isle that shuddered gelatinously beneath him. When he reached the solid shore and the shelter of the palm-tall rushes, he was equally careful to avoid the pale porphyry stairs that wound heavenward through dizzy, nadir-cleaving chasms and along glassy scarps to the ever-mysterious and terrible house of Maal Dweb. The causey and the stairs were guarded by those that he did not wish to meet: the silent, colossal iron servitors of Maal Dweb, whose arms ended in long crescent blades of tempered steel which were raised in implacable scything against any who came thither without their master's permission.\n\nTiglari's naked body was smeared from crown to heel with the juice of a jungle plant repugnant to all the fauna of Xiccarph. By virtue of this he hoped to pass unharmed the ferocious ape-like creatures that roamed at will through the cliff-hung gardens and halls of the Tyrant. He carried a coil of woven root-fiber, wonderfully strong and light, and weighted with a brazen ball at one end, for use in climbing the mountain. At his side, in a sheath of chimera-skin, he wore a needle-sharp knife that had been dipt in the mortal poison of winged vipers.\n\nMany, before Tiglari, with the same noble dream of tyrannicide, had attempted to cross the pitchy fen and scale the forbidding scarps. But none had returned; and the fate of such as had actually won to the mountain palace of Maal Dweb was a much-disputed problem; since no man had ever again beheld them, living or dead. But Tiglari, the jungle hunter, skilled in the slaying of fierce and crafty beasts, was undeterred by the more than hideous probabilities before him.\n\nThe escalade of the mountain would have been a highly dangerous feat by the full light of the three suns of Xiccarph. With eyes that were keen as those of some night-flying pterodactyl, Tiglari hurled his weighted coil about projecting coigns and fang-like salients. Hand over hand, he went up with simian ease from foothold to precarious foothold; and at length he attained a narrow buttress beneath the final cliff. From this vantage, it was an easy matter to fling his rope around the crooked bole of a tree that leaned gulfward with scimitar-like foliage from the gardens of Maal Dweb.\n\nEvading the sharp and semi-metallic leaves that seemed to slash downward as the tree bent limberly with his dangling weight, he stood, stooping warily, on the fearsome and widely fabled mesa. Here, it was rumored, with no human aid, the half-demoniac sorcerer and scientist had carved the more lofty pinnacles of the old mountain into walls, cupolas and turrets, and had levelled a great space about them. This space he had covered immediately with loamy soil, produced by magic; and therein he had planted curious baneful trees from outlying worlds beyond the suns of Xiccarph, together with flowers that might have been those of some teeming and exuberant hell.\n\nLittle enough was actually known of these gardens; but the flora that grew on the northern, southern and western sides of the palace was popularly believed to be less deadly than that which faced the dawning of the triple suns. Much of this latter vegetation, according to myth, had been trained and topiarized in the form of an almost infinite labyrinth, balefully ingenious, from which egress was impossible: a maze that concealed in its windings the most fatal and atrocious traps, the most unpredictable dooms, invented by the malign Daedalus. Mindful of this labyrinth, Tiglari had approached the place on the side that fronted the three-fold sunset.\n\nBreathless, with arms that ached from the long, arduous climb, he crouched in the garden shadows. About him he saw the heavy-hooded blossoms that leaned from a winy gloom in venomous languour, or fawned toward him with open corollas that exhaled a narcotic perfume or diffused a pollen of madness. Anomalous, multiform, with silhouettes that curdled the blood or touched the brain with nightmare, the trees of Maal Dweb appeared to gather and conspire against him beyond the flowers. Some arose with the sinuous towering of plumed pythons, or aigretted dragons. Others crouched with radiating limbs that were like the hairy members of colossal arachnidans. They seemed to close in upon Tiglari with a stealthy motion. They waved their frightful darts of thorn, their scythe-like leaves. They blotted the four moons with webs of arabesque menace. They reared from interminably coiling roots behind mammoth foliages that resembled an army of interlocking shields.\n\nWith endless caution and calculation, the hunter made his way forward, seeking a rift in the armed phalanx of vegetable monstrosities. His faculties, ever alert, were abnormally quickened by a grievous fear, intensified by a mighty hatred. The fear was not for himself, but for the girl Athle', his beloved and the fairest of his tribe, who had gone up alone that very evening by the causey of corundum and the porphyry stairs at the summons of Maal Dweb. His hatred was that of a brave man and an outraged lover for the all-powerful, all-dreaded tyrant whom no man had ever seen, and from whose abode no woman came back; who spoke with an iron voice that was audible at will in the far cities or the outmost jungles; who punished the rebellious and the disobedient with a doom of falling fire that was swifter than the thunderstone.\n\nMaal Dweb had taken ever the fairest from among the maidens of the planet Xiccarph; and no palace of walled towns, or savage outland cave, was exempt from his unknown scrutiny. He had chosen no less than fifty girls during the three decades of his tyranny; and these, forsaking their lovers and kinsfolk voluntarily, lest the wrath of Maal Dweb should descend upon them, had gone one by one to the mountain citadel and were lost behind its cryptic walls. There, as the odalisques of the aging sorcerer, they were supposed to dwell in halls that multiplied their beauty with a thousand mirrors; and were said to have for servants women of brass and men of iron that mimicked in all ways the motion and speech of living people.\n\nTiglari had poured before Athle' the uncouth adoration of his heart and the barbaric spoils of the chase, but having many rivals, was still unsure of her favor. Cool as a river lily, and no less impartial, she had accepted his worship and that of the others, among whom the warrior Mocair was perhaps the most formidable. Returning at eve from the hunt, Tiglari had found the tribe in lamentation; and, learning that Athle' had departed to the harem of Maal Dweb, was swift to follow.\n\nHe had not announced his intention to his fellow tribesmen, since the ears of Maal Dweb were everywhere; and he did not know whether Mocair or any of the others had preceded him in his desperate errantry. Mocair, however, had been absent; and it was not unlikely that he had already dared the obscure and hideous perils of the mountain.\n\nThe thought of this was enough to drive Tiglari forward with a rash disregard of the poisonous, reptile flowers and clutching foliations. He came anon to a gap in the horrible grove, and saw the saffron lights from the lower windows of Maal Dweb, and a dark thronging of domes and turrets that assailed the constellations above. The lights were vigilant as the eyes of sleepless dragons, and appeared to regard him with an evil, unblinking awareness. But Tiglari leapt toward them, across the gap, and heard the clash of sabered leaves that met behind him.\n\nBefore him was an open lawn, covered with a queer grass that squirmed like innumerable worms beneath his bare feet. He did not care to linger upon that lawn, but ran onward with light, skimming paces. There were no footmarks in the grass; but nearing the portico of the palace, he saw a coil of thin rope that someone had flung aside, and knew that Mocair had preceded him.\n\nThere were paths of mottled marble about the palace, and fountains and waterfalls that played with a gurgling as of blood from the throats of carven monsters. The open portals were unguarded, and the whole building was still as a mausoleum lit by windless lamps. No shadows moved behind the brilliant yellow windows; and darkness slept unbroken among the high towers and cupolas. Tiglari, however, mistrusted sorely the appearance of quietude and slumber, and followed the bordering paths for some distance before daring to approach nearer to the palace.\n\nCertain large and shadowy animals, which he took for the apish monsters of Maal Dweb, went by him in the gloom. They were hairy and uncouth, with sloping heads. Some of them ran in four-footed fashion, while others maintained the half-erect posture of anthropoids. They did not offer to molest Tiglari: but, whining dismally like dogs, they slunk away as if to avoid him. By this token, he knew that they were veritable beasts, and could not abide the odor with which he had smeared his limbs and torso.\n\nAt length, he came to a lampless portico with crowded columns. Here, with the silent gliding of a jungle snake, he entered the mysterious and ever-dreadful house of Maal Dweb. Behind the dark pillars, a door stood open; and beyond the door were the dim and seemingly endless reaches of an empty hall.\n\nTiglari went in with redoubled caution, and began to follow the arrased wall. The place was full of unknown perfumes, languorous and somnolent: a subtle reek as of censers in hidden alcoves of love. He did not like the perfumes; and the silence troubled him more and more as he went deeper into the palace. It seemed to him that the darkness was thick with unheard breathings, was alive with invisible and sinister movements.\n\nSlowly, like the opening of great yellow eyes, the yellow flames arose in mighty lamps of copper that hung along the hall. Tiglari hid himself behind a heavy-figured arras; but peeping out with eerie trepidation, he saw that the hall was still deserted. Finally, he dared to resume his progress. All about him, the imperial hangings, broidered with purple men and azure women on a field of bright blood, appeared to stir with easy life in a wind that he could not feel; and the lamps regarded him with unwavering splendid eyes. But there was no sign of the presence of Maal Dweb; and the metal servitors and human odalisques of the tyrant were nowhere to be seen.\n\nThe doors on either side of the hall, with cunningly mated valves of ebony and ivory, were all closed. At the far end, Tiglari saw a rift of flaming light in a somber double arras. Parting the arras very softly, he peered into a huge, brightly illumined chamber that seemed at first sight to be the harem of Maal Dweb, peopled with all the girls that the enchanter had summoned to his mountain dwelling over a course of decades. In fact, it seemed that there were many hundreds, leaning or recumbent on ornate couches, or standing in attitudes of languor or terror. Tiglari discerned in the throng the women of Ommu-Zain, whose flesh is whiter than desert salt; the slim girls of Uthmai, who are moulded from breathing, palpitating jet; the queenly amber girls of equatorial Xala; and the small women of Ilap, who have the tones of newly greening bronze. But among them all, he could not find the lilied beauty of Athle'.\n\nGreatly did he marvel at the number of the women and the utter stillness with which they maintained their various postures. There was no lifting nor falling of eyelids, no dropping of hands, no curving nor opening of lips. They were like images of living, subtly painted marble, or goddesses that slept in some enchanted hall of eternity.\n\nTiglari, the intrepid hunter, was awed and frightened. Here, surely, was proof of the fabled sorceries of Maal Dweb. These women - if indeed they were women and not mere statues - had been made the thralls of a death-like spell of immortal slumber. It was as if some invisible medium of adamantine silence had filled the room, had formed about its occupants: a silence wherein, it seemed, no mortal being could draw breath.\n\nHowever, if Tiglari were to continue his search for Maal Dweb and Athle', it was necessary for him to traverse the enchanted chamber. Feeling that a marble sleep might descend upon him at the very crossing of the sill, he went with holden breath and furtive pard-like paces. About him, the women preserved their eternal stillness, their various airs and attitudes. Each, it appeared, had been overcome by the spell at the instant of some particular emotion, whether of fear, wonder, curiosity, vanity, weariness, anger or voluptuousness. Their number was fewer than he had supposed, and the room itself was smaller, but metal mirrors, panelling the walls, had created an illusion of multitude and immensity.\n\nAt the further end, he came to a second double arras, slightly parted, and revealing only shadow beyond. Peering through, he beheld a twilight chamber, illuminated dimly by two censers that gave forth a parti-colored glow and a red fume as of vaporing blood. The censers were set on lofty tripods in the far corners, facing each other. Between them, beneath a canopy of some dark and smouldering stuff with fringes braided like women's hair, was a couch of nocturnal purples with a valance of silver birds that fought against golden snakes. On the couch, in sober garments, a man reclined as if weary or asleep. The face of the man was a pale mask of mystery lying amid ambiguous shadows; but it did not occur to Tiglari that this being was any other than the redoubtable and tyrannic sorcerer whom he had come to slay. He knew that this was Maal Dweb, whom no man had seen in the flesh, but whose power was manifest to all; the occult, omniscient ruler of Xiccarph; the overlord of kings; the suzerain of the three suns and of all their moons and planets.\n\nLike ghostly sentinels, the symbols of the grandeur of Maal Dweb, the images of his frightful empire, rose up to confront Tiglari. But the thought of Athle' was a red mist that blotted all. He forgot his eerie terrors, his awe of the ensorcelled palace. The rage of the bereaved lover, the bloodthirst of the cunning hunter, awoke within him to guide his agile, stealthy paces, to make firm his powerful thews. The chamber was empty, except for the still and languid figure on the couch. Tiglari neared the unconscious sorcerer; and his hand grew tight on the hilt of the needle-like knife that was dipt in viper-venom.\n\nThe man before him lay with closed eyes and a cryptic weariness on his mouth and eyelids. He seemed to meditate rather than sleep, like one who wanders in a maze of distant memories or profound reveries. About him the walls were draped with funereal hangings, darkly and vaguely figured. Above him the twin censers wrought a cloudy glow, and diffused throughout the room their drowsy myrrh, which made the senses of Tiglari swim with a strange dimness.\n\nCrouching tiger-wise beside the valance of birds and serpents, he made ready for the stroke. Then, mastering the subtle vertigo of the perfumes, he rose up; and his arm, with the darting movement of some heavy but supple adder, struck fiercely at the tyrant's heart.\n\nIt was as if he had tried to pierce a wall of adamant. In mid-air, before and above the recumbent enchanter, the knife clashed on some impenetrable substance that Tiglari could not see; and the point broke off and tinkled on the floor at his feet. Uncomprehending, baffled, he peered at the being whom he had sought to slay. Maal Dweb had not stirred nor opened his eyes. There was neither frown nor smile on his features; but their look of enigmatic weariness was somehow touched with a faint and cruel amusement.\n\nHesitantly, Tiglari put out his hand to verify a certain curious notion that had occurred to him. Even as he had suspected, there was no couch or canopy between the fuming censers - only a vertical, unbroken, highly-polished surface, in which the whole scene was apparently reflected. He had tried to kill a mirrored image. But, to his further mystification, he himself was not visible in the mirror.\n\nHe whirled about, thinking Maal Dweb must be somewhere in the room. Even as he turned, the funereal draperies rushed back with an evil, silken whispering from the wall, as if drawn by unseen hands. The chamber leaped into sudden glaring light, the walls appeared to recede illimitably; and naked giants, whose umber-brown limbs and torsos glistened as if smeared with ointment, stood in menacing postures on every side. Their eyes glowered like those of jungle creatures; and each of them held an enormous knife, from which the point had been broken.\n\nThis, thought Tiglari, was a fearsome thaumaturgy; and he crouched down beneath the tripods, wary as a trapped animal, to await the assault of the giants. But these beings, crouching simultaneously, mimicked his every movement. By degrees it came to him that what he saw was his own reflection, multiplied and monstrously amplified in the mirrors of Maal Dweb.\n\nHe turned again. The tasseled canopy, the couch of night-dark purples with its figured valance, the reclining dreamer in plain vestments, all had vanished. Of that which he had beheld, only the smoking censers remained, rearing before a glassy wall that gave back like the others the reflection of Tiglari himself.\n\nBafflement and terror united now in the savage brain of the hunter. He felt that Maal Dweb, the all-seeing, all-potent magician, was playing a game and was deluding him with elaborate mockeries. Rashly indeed had Tiglari pitted his simple brawn and forest craft against a being of such supernatural power and demoniac artifice. He dared not stir; he scarcely ventured to breathe. The monstrous reflections appeared to watch him like ogres who guard a captive pygmy. The light, which emanated as if from hidden lamps in the mirrors, took on a more pitiless and alarming luster, and centered itself upon him with a silent horror. The vast, illusive reaches of the room appeared to deepen; and far away in their shadows, he saw the gathering of vapors with human faces that melted and re-formed incessantly and were never twice the same.\n\nEver the eerie radiance brightened; ever the mist of faces, like a hell-born fume, dissolved and re-limned itself behind the immobile giants, in the lengthening vistas. An unheard laughter, malevolent, scornful, seemed to lurk beyond the stillness. How long Tiglari waited, he could not tell; the bright and frozen horror of that room was a thing apart from time.\n\nNow, in the litten air, a voice began to speak; a voice that was toneless, deliberate - and disembodied. It was faintly contemptuous; a little weary; slightly cruel. It was impossible to align or locate; near as the beating of Tiglari's heart, and yet infinitely far.\n\n\"What do you seek, Tiglari?\" said the voice. \"Do you think to enter with impunity the palace of Maal Dweb? Others - many others, with the same intentions - have come before you: but all have paid a certain price for their temerity.\"\n\n\"I seek the maiden Athle',\" said Tiglari. \"What have you done with her?\" The words were strange to him, their very sound was remote, as if another than himself had spoken.\n\n\"Athle' is very beautiful,\" replied the voice. \"It is the will of Maal Dweb to make a certain use of her loveliness. The use is not one that should concern a hunter of wild beasts . . . You are unwise, Tiglari.\"\n\n\"Where is Athle'?\" persisted the hunter.\n\n\"Athle' has gone to find her fate in the labyrinth of Maal Dweb. Not long ago, the warrior Mocair, who had followed her to my palace, went out at my suggestion to pursue his search amid the threadless windings of that never to be exhausted maze. Go now, Tiglari, and seek her also . . . There are many mysteries in my labyrinth; and among them all, mayhap, there is one which you are destined to solve.\"\n\nThe hunter saw that a door had opened in the mirror-panelled wall. In the depth of the mirrors, two of the metal slaves of Maal Dweb had appeared. Taller than living men, and gleaming from head to foot with implacable lusters as of burnished swords, they came forward upon Tiglari. The right arm of each was handed with a crescent sickle. Hastily, with no backward glance, the hunter went out through the open door. Behind him he heard the surly clash of its meeting valves.\n\nThe short night of the planet Xiccarph was not yet over; and the four moons had all gone down. But before him he saw the beginning of the fabled maze, illuminated clearly by glowing globular fruits that hung lantern-wise from baroque arches and arcades of foliage. Guided by their still, uncanny luminescence, he entered the labyrinth.\n\nAt first, it was a place of elfin fantasies and whims. There were quaintly turned estrades, pillared with slim and antic trees, latticed with the drolly peering faces of extravagant orchids, that led the seeker to hidden, surprising bowers of goblinry. It was as if those outer meanderings had been planned merely to entice and bemuse and beguile.\n\nThen, by vague degrees, as the hunter went on, it seemed that the designer's mood had darkened, had become more ominous and baleful. The trees that lined the path, with twisted, intertwining boles, were Laocoons of struggle and torture, lit by enormous fungi that seemed to lift unholy tapers. The path itself ran downward, or climbed with evilly tilted steps through caverns of imbricated leafage that shone with the brazen glistening of dragon-scales. At every turning the way divided before Tiglari; the devious branchings multiplied; and skillful though he was in jungle-craft, it would have been wholly impossible for him to retrace his wanderings. He kept on, hoping that chance would somehow lead him to Athle'; and many times he called her name aloud, but was answered only by remote, derisive echoes, or by the dolorous howling of some unseen beast that had become lost in the maze of Maal Dweb.\n\nHe came to eerie pools, alight with coiling and wreathing witch-fires, in dim arboreal grottoes. Greenish, bloated hands as of dead men appeared to lift from the changing films of phosphorescence; and once he thought that he beheld the drowning face of Athle'. He plunged into the shallow pool - but found only fetid slime, and a swollen, nauseous thing that squirmed slowly beneath his touch.\n\nNow he was mounting through arbors of malignant hydra growths that coiled and uncoiled about him tumultuously. The way lightened more and more; the night-shining fruits and blossoms were pale and sickly as the dying tapers of a witches' revel. The earliest of the three suns had risen; and its gamboge-yellow beams were filtering in through the plaited horrors of frilled and venomous vines.\n\nFar off, and seeming to fall from some hidden height in the labyrinth before him, he heard a chorus of brazen voices that were like articulate bells or gongs. He could not distinguish the words; but the accents were those of a solemn and portentous announcement. They were fraught with mystic finality, with hieratic doom. They ceased; and there was no sound other than the hiss and rustle of swaying plants.\n\nTiglari went on. The tortuous maze became wilder and more anomalous. There were tiered growths, like obscene sculptures or architectural forms, that seemed to be of stone and metal. Others were like carnal nightmares of rooted flesh, that wallowed and fought and coupled in noisome ooze. Foul things with chancrous blossoms flaunted themselves on infernal obelisks. Living parasitic mosses of crimson crawled on vegetable monsters that swelled and bloated behind the columns of accursed pavilions.\n\nIt seemed now that the hunter's every step was predestined and dictated. He was no longer free to choose his way; for many paths were overgrown by things that he did care to face; and others were blocked by horrid portcullises of cacti, or ended in pools whose waters teemed with leeches larger than tunnies. The second and third suns of Xiccarph arose; but their beams of emerald and carmine served but to heighten the terrors of the web that had closed in about Tiglari.\n\nBy stairs where floral serpents crept, and gradients lined with tossing, clashing aloes, he climbed slowly on. Rarely could he see the labyrinthine reaches below, or the levels toward which he was tending. Somewhere on the blind path, he met one of the ape-like animals of Maal Dweb: a dark, savage creature, sleek and glistening like a wet otter, as if it had bathed in one of the hidden pools. It passed him with a hoarse growl, recoiling as the others had done from his repulsively smeared body . . . But nowhere could he find the maiden Athle' or the warrior Mocair, who had preceded him into the maze.\n\nNow he had reached a curious little pavement of somber onyx, oblong, and wholly surrounded, except on the side of his approach, by enormous flowers with fluted bronze-like stems and great leaning balls that seemed to be the mottled heads of bestial chimeras, yawning to disclose their carmine throats. Through the gap in this singular hedge, he stepped forward on the pavement and stood staring irresolutely at the serried blooms: for here the way seemed to end.\n\nThe onyx beneath his feet was wet with some unknown, sticky fluid. He was dazed with the wonder, strangeness, and intricate, coiling horror through which he had passed; but a dim warning of peril stirred within him. He turned toward the gap through which he had entered, but his impulse of retreat was all too late. From the base of each of the tall flower stems, a long tendril like a wire of bronze uncoiled with lightning rapidity, and closed about his ankles. He stood trapped and helpless at the center of a taut net. Then, while he struggled ineffectually, the huge stems began to lean and tilt toward him, till the carmine mouths of the blossoms were close about his knees like a circle of fawning monsters.\n\nNearer they came, almost touching him. From their thick lips a clear, hueless liquid, dripping slowly at first, and then running in little rills, descended on his feet and ankles and shanks. Indescribably, his flesh crawled beneath it; then there was a peculiar passing numbness; then a furious stinging like the bites of innumerable insects. Between the crowding heads of the flowers he saw that his legs had undergone a mysterious and horrifying change; their natural hairiness had thickened, had assumed a dark and shaggy pile like the fur of apes; the shanks themselves had somehow shortened; and the feet had grown longer, with uncouth finger-like toes such as were possessed by the animals of Maal Dweb!\n\nIn a frenzy of nameless alarm and fear, he drew his broken-tipped knife and began to slash at the flowers. It was as if he had struck at monstrous bells of ringing iron, had assailed the armored heads of dragons. The blade snapped at the hilt. Then the blossoms, lifting hideously, were leaning about his waist, were laving his hips and thighs in their thin, evil slaver.\n\nAcross the bizarre nightmare in which his brain and body were drowning impotently, he heard the startled cry of a woman. Through the open gap in the hedge, he beheld a strange scene which the hitherto impenetrable maze, parting as if magic, had revealed. Fifty feet away, on the same level as the onyx pavement, there stood an elliptic dais or low altar of moonwhite stone at whose center the maiden Athle', emerging from the labyrinth on a raised walk of porphyry, had paused in an attitude of wonder. Before her, in the claws of an immense marble lizard that reared above the dais, a great circular mirror of steely metal was held upright, with the monster's head hidden from view behind it. Athle', as if fascinated by some celestial vision, was peering into the steely disk. She presented her wide-eyed profile to Tiglari; and the mirror itself was seen obliquely, with the foreshortened body of the lizard reaching away at a sharp angle and mingling obscenely with the half-reptilian maze. Midway between the onyx pavement and the ellipse of pale stone, a row of six slender brazen columns, topped with graven heads like demoniac Termini, rose at broad intervals and faced alternately the hunter and the girl.\n\nTiglari would have called out to Athle'; but at that moment she took a single step toward the mirror, as if drawn by something that she saw in its depths; and the dull disk seemed to brighten with some internal, incandescent flame. The eyes of the hunter were temporarily blinded by the spiky rays that leapt forth from it for an instant, enveloping and transfixing the maiden. When the dimness cleared away in swirling blots of sultry color, he saw that Athle', in a pose of statuesque rigidity, was still regarding the mirror with startled eyes. She had not moved; the wonder was frozen on her face: and it came to Tiglari that she was like the women who slept an enchanted slumber in the palace of Maal Dweb. Even as this thought occurred to him, he heard the ringing chorus of metallic voices, that seemed to emanate from the graven demon heads upon the columns.\n\n\"The maiden Athle',\" announced the voices in solemn and portentous tones, \"has beheld herself in the mirror of Eternity, and has passed forever beyond the changes and corruptions of Time.\"\n\nTiglari felt that he was sinking into some enormous, obscurely terrible fen of dreams. He could comprehend nothing of what had befallen Athle'; and his own fate was an equally dark and dread enigma beyond the solution of a simple hunter.\n\nNow the leaning blossoms had lifted about his shoulders, were laving his arms, his body. Beneath their abhorrent alchemy the transformation continued. A long fur sprang up on the thickening torso; the arms lengthened; they became simian; the hands took on a likeness to the feet. From the neck downward, Tiglari differed in no wise from the apes of the garden.\n\nIn helpless abject terror, he waited for the completion of the metamorphosis. Then, slowly, he became aware that a man in sober garments, with eyes and mouth replete with the weariness of strange things, was standing before him. Behind the man, as if attending him, were two of the sickle-handed automatons of iron.\n\nIn a somewhat languid voice, the man uttered an unknown word that vibrated in the air with prolonged, mysterious aftertones. The circle of craning flowers drew back from Tiglari, resuming their former upright positions in a weird hedge; and the wiry tendrils were withdrawn from his ankles, leaving him free. Hardly able to comprehend his release, he heard a sound of brazen voices, and knew dimly that the demon heads if the columns had spoken, saying:\n\n\"The hunter Tiglari has been laved in the nectar of the blossoms of primordial life, and has become in all ways, from the neck downward, even as the beasts that he hunted.\"\n\nWhen the solemn chorus ceased, the weary man in sober raiment came nearer and addressed him:\n\n\"I, Maal Dweb, had intended to deal with you precisely as I dealt with Mocair and many others. Mocair was the beast that you met in the labyrinth, with new-made fur that was still sleek and wet from the liquor of the flowers; and you saw some of his predecessors about the palace. However, I find that my whims are not always the same. You, Tiglari, unlike the others, shall at least remain a man from the neck upward; and you are free to resume your wanderings in the labyrinth, and escape from it if you can. I do not wish to see you again, and my clemency arises from another reason than esteem for your kind. Go now: the maze has many windings which you are yet to traverse.\"\n\nA dreadful awe was upon Tiglari; his native fierceness, his savage volition, were tamed by the enchanter's languid will. With one backward look of fearful concern and wonder at the frozen shape of Athle', he withdrew obediently, slouching like a great ape. His fur glistening wetly to the three suns, he vanished amid the meanderings of the labyrinth.\n\nMaal Dweb, attended by his metal slaves, went over to the figure of Athle', which still regarded the steely mirror with astonished eyes.\n\n\"Mong Lut,\" he said, addressing by name the nearer of the two automatons that followed at his heels, \"it has been, as you know, my caprice to eternalize the frail beauty of women. Athle', like the others whom I have summoned to the mountain and have sent out to explore the ingenious maze, has looked upon that mirror whose sudden radiance turns the flesh to a stone that is fairer than marble and no less eternal . . . Also, as you know, it has been my whim to turn men into beasts with the copious fluid of certain artificial flowers, so that their outer semblance should conform strictly to their inner nature. Is it not well, Mong Lut, that I should have done these things? Am I not Maal Dweb, in whom all knowledge and all power reside?\"\n\n\"Yes, master,\" echoed the automaton in an iron voice, \"you are Maal Dweb, the all-wise, the all-powerful, and it is well that you should have done these things.\"\n\n\"However,\" continued Maal Dweb, \"the repetition of even the most remarkable thaumaturgies can grow monotonous after a certain number of times. I do not think that I shall deal again in this fashion with any woman, nor deal thus with any man. Is it not well, Mong Lut, that I should vary my sorceries in future? Am I not Maal Dweb, the all-resourceful?\"\n\n\"Indeed, you are Maal Dweb,\" agreed the automaton, \"and it would be well for you to diversify your enchantments.\"\n\nMaal Dweb, in his manner, was not ill pleased with the answers that the automaton had given. He cared little for converse, other than the iron echoing of his metal servitors, who assented always to all that he said, and who spared him the tedium of arguments. And it may have been that there were times when he wearied a little even of this, and preferred the silence of the petrified women, or the muteness of the beasts that could no longer call themselves men.",

"借着希卡夫四轮残月微弱的光芒——每轮月亮都处于不同相位却同样残缺——提格拉里穿越了索姆的无底沼泽。那里没有爬虫栖息，也无巨龙降临，唯有漆黑的淤泥在永不停息的翻涌蠕动中保持着诡异的生机。他谨慎地避开了横跨沼泽的白色刚玉堤道，在凝胶般颤抖的莎草岛间险象环生地穿行。当踏上坚实岸缘躲入棕榈高的芦苇丛时，他同样小心地绕开了那些蜿蜒入云的苍白斑岩阶梯——它们穿过令人晕眩的深渊裂隙，沿着玻璃般光滑的峭壁，通向永远神秘可怖的马尔·德韦布之居所。堤道与阶梯都由他不愿遭遇的存在把守：马尔·德韦布那些沉默的巨型铁仆从，它们的手臂末端装有淬火钢制的弧形长刃，会毫不留情地斩向任何未经主人许可的闯入者。\n\n提格拉里从头顶到脚踵都涂抹着令希卡夫所有动物厌恶的丛林植物汁液。凭借这层保护，他希望能安然通过那些在暴君悬壁花园与厅堂间自由游荡的类猿猛兽。他带着一捆异常轻韧的根须纤维绳，末端系着铜球用于攀山，腰间还别着一把浸过飞翼毒蛇致命毒液的锋利匕首，插在嵌合兽皮制成的鞘中。\n\n在提格拉里之前，许多怀揣弑暴君崇高梦想的人都曾尝试穿越沥青沼泽、攀登险峻峭壁。但无人归还；而那些真正抵达马尔·德韦布山巅宫殿者的命运更是众说纷纭，因无论生死都再无人见过他们。但作为精通猎杀凶猛狡兽的丛林猎手，提格拉里并未被眼前近乎骇人的可能性吓退。\n\n即便在希卡夫三轮烈日当空时，攀登此山也堪称险举。此刻提格拉里以夜行翼龙般的锐利目光，将铜球绳索抛向突出的岩角与獠牙般的山脊。他像猿猴般轻巧地从一个岌岌可危的落脚点攀向另一个，最终抵达终极峭壁下的狭窄扶壁。从这里，他轻易将绳索缠上了马尔·德韦布花园中一株弯向深渊的怪树——那树生着弯刀状的叶片。\n\n避开那些随他重量摆荡而劈下的半金属利叶后，他弯腰警惕地站在了这座恐怖传说遍布的台地上。据传那位半魔巫师兼科学家未借人力，便将古老山峦的尖峰雕琢成墙垣、穹顶与塔楼，并在周围辟出广阔平台。他用法术变出沃土覆盖地表，种植了来自希卡夫太阳系外世界的剧毒奇树，以及恍若来自某个繁茂地狱的妖花。\n\n关于这些花园的实情知之甚少，但人们普遍认为宫殿北、西、南三面的植物比朝向三轮旭日的那侧温和。据神话所述，东面植被被修剪成近乎无限的迷宫，暗藏致命陷阱与不可预知的厄运——这是那位邪恶代达罗斯设计的恶毒杰作。提格拉里牢记这点，特意从三重落日方向接近。\n\n他喘息着蹲伏在花园阴影中，酸痛的手臂见证着漫长艰险的攀爬。周围垂着兜状巨花，在酒红色幽暗中显出毒性的慵懒，或是朝他绽放花冠，吐出麻醉香气与致狂花粉。马尔·德韦布的怪树在花丛后方显现出令血液凝固、噩梦侵脑的畸形轮廓，仿佛正集结密谋。有的如羽饰巨蟒般盘绕耸立，有的似多毛蛛怪般辐射肢臂。它们以隐秘动作向提格拉里逼近，挥舞荆棘长刺与镰刀状叶片，用阿拉伯纹般的威胁之网遮蔽四轮月亮，又从层层巨叶（如交叠盾牌的军队）后扬起无尽盘绕的根系。\n\n猎手以无尽谨慎前行，寻找植物怪阵的缺口。剧烈恐惧与强大仇恨使他感官异常敏锐。这恐惧非为自身，而是为当晚独自响应马尔·德韦布召唤、踏上刚玉堤道与斑岩阶梯的恋人阿瑟尔——她是他部落中最美的少女。他的仇恨则源于勇者对那位无人得见、却能让声音响彻远城僻野、以天降火刑惩戒叛逆的全能暴君的愤怒。\n\n三十年来，马尔·德韦布从希卡夫各处掳走不少于五十名少女——无论城墙宫殿还是蛮荒洞穴都逃不过他的无形审视。为避免怒火波及亲族，这些女子自愿告别爱人与家园，最终消失在那座神秘宫殿的高墙之后。传说她们作为老巫师的婢妾，居住在被千面镜子无限复制美貌的厅堂，由能模仿活人举止的黄铜女仆与铁制男仆服侍。\n\n提格拉里曾向阿瑟尔献上粗犷爱意与狩猎战利品，但因众多竞争者（尤其战士莫凯尔）的存在，始终未能确保芳心。黄昏狩猎归来时，他发现部落正为阿瑟尔的离去哀恸，便立刻追来。他未向族人透露行踪——马尔·德韦布的耳目无处不在——也不确定莫凯尔是否已先他一步踏上这死亡征程。想到此节，他不再顾忌毒花怪藤，冒然冲向恐怖树林的缺口，看见了马尔·德韦布低层窗户透出的硫磺色灯光，以及刺破星群的暗色穹顶塔楼。那些灯光如同不眠巨龙的眼睛，以恶意的凝视注视着他。提格拉里纵身跃过缺口，身后传来利叶交击的铮鸣。\n\n前方是蠕虫般扭动的怪草

worms\"，为保持哥特风格译为\"扭动着无数蠕虫般怪草的草坪\"）。他快步掠过草坪，在宫殿门廊附近发现了被弃的细绳——莫凯尔来过的证据。\n\n宫殿周围是斑纹大理石小径，喷泉与瀑布从石雕怪兽喉中吐出血液般的汩汩水流。敞开的门廊无人把守，整座建筑如点着无风灯火的陵墓般死寂。明黄窗棂后没有阴影移动，高塔圆顶下黑暗凝固不散。提格拉里不信任这种静谧假象，沿边缘小径潜行许久才敢靠近。\n\n阴影中掠过些类猿怪物：毛发蓬乱、头颅低垂，有的四足奔行，有的半直立如人猿。它们发出犬类般的哀鸣避开他——这证实了它们确是野兽，厌恶他身上的气味。\n\n最终他来到无灯的多柱门廊，如丛林毒蛇般滑入了马尔·德韦布那永恒可怖的居所。暗柱后的门扉洞开，露出幽暗无尽的前厅。\n\n提格拉里加倍谨慎地贴着挂毯墙前进。空气中弥漫着隐秘香炉般的催情异香，愈深入宫殿，寂静愈令人不安。他感觉黑暗中充满无声的呼吸，看不见的恶意在流动。\n\n铜灯突然如睁开的黄色巨眼般亮起。提格拉里躲进绣着紫肤男与蓝肤女的华丽挂毯后窥视，确认大厅空无一人后才继续前进。挂毯上的人物在无风处诡谲浮动，灯盏如璀璨眼眸紧盯他不放。但马尔·德韦布与其金属仆从、人类婢妾皆无踪影。\n\n大厅两侧的黑檀象牙对开门紧闭。尽头处，提格拉里透过双层暗幕瞥见一道火光。他轻轻拨开帷幕，窥见一个灯火通明的巨厅——初看像是马尔·德韦布收纳数十年来所掳少女的后宫。数百名女子或倚华榻，或立其间，姿态慵懒或惊恐。他认出沙漠盐般苍白的奥姆-扎因女子、乌斯迈的乌玉般莹润的苗条少女、赤道夏拉的琥珀色女王、伊拉普新青铜般青翠的娇小女人，却唯独不见百合般纯洁的阿瑟尔。\n\n这些女子保持姿态的绝对静止令他震惊——没有眼睑颤动，没有手指垂落，没有唇瓣开合。她们如同被施了永恒沉睡魔法的彩绘大理石像。\n\n无畏的猎手提格拉里此刻既敬畏又恐惧。眼前这景象无疑印证了马尔·德维布传说中的可怕巫术——这些女子（如果她们真能被称作女子而非石像）显然已沦为某种永生沉眠咒的奴仆。整间屋子仿佛被某种无形的静默介质所充斥，将其中所有存在都凝固其中：那是一种连凡人呼吸都会被扼杀的绝对死寂。\n\n若要继续搜寻马尔·德维布与阿瑟的下落，他必须穿越这座被诅咒的厅堂。提格拉里屏住呼吸，如黑豹般蹑足前行，唯恐跨过门槛的瞬间自己也会化作大理石像。那些女子保持着永恒的静止姿态，面容凝固在恐惧、惊愕、好奇、虚荣、倦怠、愤怒或情欲爆发的瞬间。她们数量比预想中稀少，房间本身也比看上去狭小，但四壁镶嵌的金属镜面制造了空间无限的错觉。\n\n尽头处第二道锦缎帷幔微微掀开，露出后方幽暗的阴影。提格拉里窥见一间暮光笼罩的内室，两只香炉散发着斑驳微光，喷吐着如凝血般的猩红烟雾。香炉置于高耸的三脚架上，中间是铺着夜紫色罩单的卧榻，银鸟与金蛇在帷幔上纠缠撕咬。榻上躺着个衣着朴素的男人，面容隐没在阴影中，却透出令人不寒而栗的威严——这必然是那位无人得见真容，却统治着西卡夫三阳诸月的全知术士。\n\n马尔·德维布帝国的可怖象征如幽灵守卫般在镜中浮现。但想到阿瑟，提格拉里眼中便只剩血色迷雾。他忘却恐惧，猎人本能驱使他握紧淬毒匕首逼近卧榻。榻上之人双目紧闭，嘴角挂着玄奥的倦意，仿佛沉溺在记忆迷宫中。香炉散发的没药令提格拉里视线模糊。\n\n他如猛虎般弓身蓄力，匕首毒蛇般刺向暴君心窝——却如同击中无形铁壁。刀尖断裂坠地的脆响中，马尔·德维布连睫毛都未颤动，唯有倦容上掠过一丝残酷的愉悦。\n\n提格拉里颤抖着触碰前方，发现香炉之间根本空无一物，只有光可鉴人的镜面映照着整个场景。他试图刺杀的竟是个镜像。更诡异的是，镜中唯独没有他自己的身影。\n\n当他转身时，丧幡突然无风自动，墙壁向无限远处退去。裸体巨人们从四面八方浮现，他们蜜蜡色的躯体泛着油光，手持断尖的巨刃。提格拉里旋即意识到，这是马尔·德维布的魔镜将他自己的倒影扭曲成了可怖的巨人军团。\n\n再次转身时，卧榻与沉睡者已消失无踪。唯有香炉仍在镜墙前燃烧，映照出无数个变形的提格拉里。猎人的原始心智终于被困惑与恐惧吞噬。他意识到自己正被全能的术士当作玩物戏弄。\n\n镜中世界突然无限延伸，人脸状的雾气在阴影中聚散无常。当无源的冷光将他笼罩时，一个无机质的声音直接在他颅腔内响起：\n\n\"擅闯马尔·德维布宫殿者，都要付出代价。\"\n\n\"把阿瑟还给我！\"猎人听见自己发出陌生的声音。\n\n\"她正在我的迷宫中寻找命运。\"那声音带着倦怠的残忍，\"或许你也该去见识下那些......未解之谜。\"\n\n镜墙突然洞开，两个金属铸造的高大奴仆手持月牙镰刀逼近。提格拉里逃向门外时，听见身后传来阀门闭合的阴冷撞击声。\n\n西卡夫行星的短暂黑夜尚未结束；四轮月亮皆已沉落。但在他眼前，传说中迷宫的入口清晰可辨——那些悬挂在巴洛克式叶蔓拱廊下的球状果实，正以灯笼般诡谲的光芒照亮前路。在这静止而怪异的辉光指引下，他步入了迷宫。\n\n起初，这是个充满精灵幻想的奇境。弯曲的台阶由细长怪诞的树木支撑，兰科植物绽放着滑稽的鬼脸，将探寻者引向妖精藏身的隐秘凉亭。这些外围的迂回曲径仿佛仅为蛊惑与欺瞒而设。\n\n而当猎手继续前行时，设计者的心境似乎逐渐阴沉，变得愈发险恶。道旁树木的枝干扭曲纠缠，犹如受难的拉奥孔雕像，在巨型真菌高举的亵渎烛火下显形。小径时而向下延伸，时而以邪异的倾斜台阶攀越鳞叶洞穴，那些叶片闪烁着龙鳞般的黄铜光泽。每个转角处都有岔路在提格拉里面前分裂，错综复杂的路径成倍增加；纵使他精通丛林之道，也绝无可能循原路返回。他不断呼唤阿瑟之名，却只换来遥远嘲弄的回响，或是某只迷失在马尔·德维布迷宫中的野兽发出的凄厉哀嚎。\n\n他来到幽暗树窟中诡异的池塘，水面缠绕着女巫之火般的磷光。泛绿肿胀如死尸的手掌从变幻的光膜中浮现；恍惚间他竟看见阿瑟溺水的面容。他冲进浅池——却只触到腐臭淤泥，以及某种在他指间缓慢蠕动的肿胀秽物。\n\n此刻他正穿越疯狂蠕动的九头蛇状藤蔓。夜光花果愈发苍白病态，犹如女巫狂欢将熄的残烛。三轮太阳中的第一轮已然升起，镉黄色的光束透过带毒藤蔓编织的恐怖帷幕渗入。\n\n远方传来黄铜般的合颂声，仿佛自迷宫中某处隐秘高处坠落。他辨不清词句，但那声调宛如庄严而不祥的宣告，充满神秘终局与神圣诅咒的意味。余音消散后，唯有植物摇曳的沙沙作响。\n\n提格拉里继续前行。扭曲的迷宫愈发狂乱畸形：出现层层叠叠的增生体，似淫秽雕塑又似石金属建筑；还有扎根血肉构成的肉欲梦魇，在恶臭泥沼中交媾撕咬。生着溃烂花朵的秽物在恶魔方尖碑上招摇，深红色的活体苔藓在诅咒亭柱后肿胀的植物怪物上爬行。\n\n猎手的每一步似乎都已被注定。无数路径被他不愿面对的怪物占据，其他则被仙人掌构成的恐怖吊闸封锁，或终止于满是金枪鱼大小水蛭的池塘。西卡夫的第二、第三轮太阳升起，它们翡翠与胭脂红的光线却只加深了笼罩提格拉里的恐怖罗网。\n\n他攀爬着蛇形花藤缠绕的阶梯，两侧龙舌兰剧烈摇摆碰撞。迷宫的底层与高处皆难得一见。某条盲径上，他遇见马尔·德维布豢养的类猿生物——这黝黑野蛮的生物如水獭般湿滑发亮，对他涂满秽物的身躯发出嘶吼后逃开……却始终不见先他进入迷宫的少女阿瑟与战士莫凯尔。\n\n最终他抵达一块阴郁缟玛瑙铺就的矩形平台，四周环绕着青铜茎秆的巨花，那些斑驳下垂的花球仿佛张口露出猩红喉咙的兽形奇美拉。当他踏上这片黏滑的石板，花茎基部突然闪电般弹出青铜丝般的卷须缠住脚踝。在他徒劳挣扎时，巨大花冠低垂至他膝边，开始滴落无色液体。\n\n他的皮肉在液体接触下诡异蠕动，继而麻木，最终如遭万虫噬咬般剧痛。透过花丛间隙，他惊恐地发现自己的双腿正发生恐怖变异：毛发浓密如猿猴，小腿缩短，脚掌拉长生出指状趾——与马尔·德维布的野兽如出一辙！\n\n正当他疯狂挥刀砍向花朵时（刀刃如击铁钟般崩断），突然听见女子惊叫。迷宫如被魔法分开般显现奇景：五十尺外白色月长石祭坛上，阿瑟正从斑岩步道走出，凝望着大理石蜥蜴爪中高举的钢镜。当她被镜中幻象吸引前进一步时，镜面突然迸发刺目光芒将她定格。六根青铜柱顶的恶魔头像随即发出宣告：\"少女阿瑟已凝视永恒之镜，永远超脱时间腐朽。\"\n\n提格拉里感到自己正沉入可怖的梦境沼泽。他无法理解阿瑟的遭遇，而自己的命运同样晦暗难解——此刻变异的花冠已蔓延至他肩头，他的躯干正长出长毛，双臂渐成猿形。\n\n当变形即将完成时，一个身着素袍、眉眼间浸透倦意的男人出现在他面前，身后跟着两名镰刀手的铁傀儡。随着男人吐出某个萦绕空气的陌生词汇，缠绕提格拉里的花冠突然退去。青铜柱上的恶魔头像再次发声，而他已半人半兽的耳中只余混沌回响。\n\n\"猎人提格拉里已被原始生命之花的甘露所沐浴，自脖颈以下，他已变得与昔日所猎杀的野兽毫无二致。\"\n\n当庄严的合唱声停歇时，那位身着素袍的疲惫男子走近他，开口说道：\n\n\"我，马尔·德韦布，本打算用处置莫凯尔与诸多他人的方式来处置你。莫凯尔正是你在迷宫中遇见的那头野兽，它新生的皮毛因花汁浸润而依然光滑湿润；你在宫殿附近也见过它的几位前辈。不过，我发现自己的奇思妙想并非恒久不变。提格拉里啊，与其他人不同，你至少能保留脖颈以上的人形；你可以继续在迷宫中游荡，若能逃脱便随你去。我不愿再见到你，这份仁慈也并非源于对你们种族的敬意。现在走吧：迷宫的曲折回廊正等着你去探索。\"\n\n可怖的敬畏感攫住了提格拉里；他那与生俱来的凶暴，野性难驯的意志，皆被巫师慵懒的意念所驯服。他回头惊恐而困惑地望了一眼阿瑟尔凝固的身姿，随即如巨猿般佝偻着身躯顺从退下。在三轮太阳的照射下，他湿漉漉的皮毛泛着微光，最终消失在迷宫错综复杂的路径中。\n\n马尔·德韦布在金属奴仆的簇拥下，走向仍以惊愕目光凝视钢镜的阿瑟尔雕像。\n\n\"蒙·拉特，\"他唤着身后两具自动机偶中较近者的名字，\"如你所知，将女性脆弱之美永恒封存向来是我的癖好。阿瑟尔与我召至山中、派去探索精巧迷宫的其他女子一样，凝视过那面镜子——其骤然绽放的光芒会将血肉化为比大理石更精美且同样永恒的石头……此外，你也知道，我惯于用人造花丰沛的汁液将男子变为野兽，令其外在形貌与内在本性彻底吻合。蒙·拉特，我施行这些法术难道不正合适吗？我难道不是全知全能的马尔·德韦布？\"\n\n\"正是，主人，\"自动机偶以钢铁之声应和道，\"您是至睿至能的马尔·德韦布，施行这些法术再恰当不过。\"\n\n\"然而，\"马尔·德韦布继续道，\"即便是最非凡的奇术，重复特定次数后也会变得乏味。我想今后不会再对任何女子施以此法，亦不会如此处置任何男子。蒙·拉特，我未来若变幻魔法难道不更妙吗？我难道不是足智多谋的马尔·德韦布？\"\n\n\"您确是马尔·德韦布，\"自动机偶附和道，\"变幻魔法对您而言再合适不过。\"\n\n马尔·德韦布对自动机偶的回答颇为满意。他素来不喜交谈，唯独钟爱这些金属仆从铁器般的应和——它们永远赞同他的每句话，使他免于争论之烦。或许有时连这应和也令他稍感厌倦，那时他宁愿倾听石化女子的静默，或是那些再不能自称为人的野兽的缄默。"

        "content": "\n\n'Athlé,' said Maal Dweb, 'I suffer from the frightful curse of omnipotence. In all Xiccarph, and in the five outer planets of the triple suns, there is no one, there is nothing, to dispute my domination. Therefore ny ennui has become intolerable.'\n\nThe girlish eyes of Athlé regarded the enchanter with a gaze of undying astonishment, which, however, was not due to his strange avowal. She was the last of the fifty-one women that Maal Dweb had turned into statues in order to preserve their frail, corruptible beauty from the worm-like gnawing of time. Since, through a laudable desire to avoid monotony, he had resolved never to repeat again this particular sorcery, the magician had cherished Athlé with the affection which an artist feels for the final masterpiece of a series. He had placed her on a little dais, beside the ivory chair in his chamber of meditation. Often he addressed to her his queries or monologues; and the fact that she did not reply or even hear was to him a signal and unfailing recommendation.\n\n'There is but one remedy for this boredom of mine,' he went on — 'the abnegation, at least for a while, of that all too certain power from which it springs. Therefore, I, Maal Dweb, the ruler of six worlds and all their moons, shall go forth alone, unheralded, and without other equipment than that which any fledgling sorcerer might possess. In this way, perhaps I shall recover the lost charm of incertitude, the foregone enchantment of peril. Adventures that I have not foreseen will be mine, and the future will wear the alluring veil of the mysterious. It remains, however, to select the field of my adventurings.'\n\nMaal Dweb arose from his curiously carven chair and waved back the four automatons of iron, having the likeness of armed men, that sprang to attend him. He passed along the halls of his palace, where painted hangings told in vermilion and purple the dread legends of his power. Through ebon valves that opened noiselessly at the uttering of a high-pitched word, he entered the chamber in which was his planetarium.\n\nThe room was walled, floored, and vaulted with a dark crystal, full of tiny, numberless fires, that gave the illusion of unbounded space with all its stars. In midair, without chains or other palpable support, there hung an array of various globes that represented the three suns, the six planets, and thirteen moons of the system ruled by Maal Dweb. The miniature suns, amber, emerald, and carmine, bathed their intricately circling worlds with an illumination that reproduced at all times the diurnal conditions of the system itself; and the pigmy satellites maintained always their corresponding orbits and relative positions.\n\nThe sorcerer went forward, walking as if on some unfathomable gulf of night, with stars and galaxies beneath him, The poising worlds were level with his shoulders as he passed among them. Disregarding the globes that corresponded to Mornoth, Xiccarph, Ulassa, Nouph, and Rhul, he came to Voltap, the outermost, which was then in aphelion on the farther side of the room.\n\nVotalp, a large and moonless world, revolved imperceptibly as he studied it. For one hemisphere, he saw, the yellow sun was at that time in total eclipse behind the sun of carmine; but in spite of this, and its greater distance from the solar triad. Votalp was lit with sufficient clearness. It was mottled with strange hues like a great cloudy opal; and the mottlings were microscopic oceans, isles. mountains, jungles, and deserts. Fantastic sceneries leapt into momentary salience, taking on the definitude and perspective of actual landscapes, and then faded back amid the iridescent blur. Glimpses of teeming, multifarious life, incredible tableaux, monstrous happenings, were beheld by Maal Dweb as he looked down like some celestial spy.\n\nIt seemed, however that he found little to divert or inveigle him in these outré doings and exotic wonders. Vision after vision rose before him, summoned and dismissed at will, as if he were turning the pages of a familiar volume. The wars of gigantic wyverns, the matings of half-vegetable monsters, the queer algae that had filled a certain ocean with their living and moving labyrinths, the remarkable spawn of certain polar glaciers: all these elicited no gleam or sparkle in his dulled eyes of blackish emerald.\n\nAt length, on that portion of the planet which was turning into the double dawn from its moonless night, he perceived an occurrence that drew and held his attention. For the first time, he began to calculate the precise latitude and longitude of the surrounding milieu.\n\n'There,' he said to himself, 'is a situation not without interest. In fact, the whole affair is quaint and curious enough to warrant my intervention. I shall visit Votalp.'\n\nHe withdrew from the planetarium and made a few preparations for his meditated journey. Having changed his robe of magisterial sable and scarlet for a hodden mantle, and having removed from his person every charm and talisman, with the exception of two phylacteries acquired during his novitiate, he went forth into the garden of his mountain-builded palace. He left no instructions with the many retainers who served with him: for these retainers were automatons of iron and brass, who would fulfill their various duties without injunction till he returned.\n\nTraversing the-curious labyrinth which he alone could solve, he came to the verge of the sheer mesa, where pythonlike lianas drooped into space, and metallic palms deployed their armaments of foliage against the far-flung horizons of the world Xiccarph. Empires and cities, lying supine beneath his magical dominion, were unrolled before him; but, giving them hardly a glance, he walked along the estrade of black marble at the very brink, till he reached a narrow promontory around which there hung at all times a deep and hueless cloud, obscuring the prospect of the lands below and beyond.\n\nThe secret of this cloud, affording access to multiple dimensions and deeply folded realms of space conterminous with far worlds, was known only to Maal Dweb. He had built a silver drawbridge on the promontory; and by lowering its airy span into the cloud, he could pass at will to the farther zones of Xiccarph, or could cross the very void between the planets.\n\nNow, after making certain highly recondite calculations, he manipulated the machinery of the light drawbridge so that its other end would fall upon the particular terrain he desired to visit in Votalp. Then, assuring himself that his calculations and adjustments were flawless, he followed the silver span into the dim, bewildering chaos of the cloud. Here, as he groped in a gray blindness, it seemed that his body and members were drawn out over infinite gulfs, and were bent through impossible angles. A single misstep would have plunged him into spatial regions from which all his cunning sorcery could have contrived no manner of return or release; but he had often trod these hidden ways, and he did not lose his equilibrium. The transit appeared to involve whole centuries of time; but finally he emerged from the cloud and came to the farther end of the drawbridge.\n\nBefore him was the scene that had lured his interest in Votalp. It was a semi-tropic valley, level and open in the foreground, and rising steeply at the other extreme, with all its multiform fantasies of vegetation, toward the cliffs and chasms of sable mountains horned with blood-red stone. The time was still early dawn; but the amber sun, freeing itself slowly from the occultation of the sun of carmine, had begun to lighten the hues and shadows of the valley with strange copper and orange. The emerald sun was still below the horizon.\n\nThe terminus of the bridge had fallen on a mossy knoll, behind which the hueless cloud had gathered, even as about the promontory in Xiccarph. Maal Dweb descended the knoll, feeling no concern whatever for the bridge. It would remain as he had left it, till the time of his return; and if, in the interim. any creatures from Votalp should cross the gulf and invade his mountain citadel, they would meet a fearful doom in the snares and windings of the labyrinth; or, failing this, would be exterminated by his iron servitors.\n\nAs he went down the knoll into the valley, the enchanter heard an eery, plaintive singing, like that of sirens who bewail some irremediable misfortune. The singing came from a sisterhood of unusual creatures, half woman and half flower, that grew on the valley bottom beside a sleepy stream of purple water. There were several scores of these lovely and charming monsters, whose feminine bodies of pink and pearl reclined amid the vermilion velvet couches of billowing petals to which they were attached. These petals were borne on mattress-like leaves and heavy, short, well-rooted stems. The flowers were disposed in irregular circles, clustering thickly toward the center, and with open intervals in the outer rows.\n\nMaal Dweb approached the flower-women with a certain caution; for he knew that they were vampires. Their arms ended in long tendrils, pale as ivory, swifter and more supple than the coils of darting serpents, with which they were wont to secure the unwary victims drawn by their singing. Of course, knowing in his wisdom the inexorable laws of nature, he felt no disapproval of such vampirism; but, on the other hand, he did not care to be its object.\n\nHe circled about the strange family at a little distance, his movements hidden from their observation by their boulders overgrown with tall, luxuriant lichens of red and yellow. Soon he neared the straggling outer plants that were upstream from the knoll on which he had landed; and in confirmation of the vision beheld in the mimic world in his planetarium, he found that the turf was upheaved and broken where five of the blossoms, growing apart from their companions, had been disrooted and removed bodily. He had seen in his vision the rape of the fifth flower, and he knew that the others were now lamenting her.\n\nSuddenly, as if they had forgotten their sorrow, the wailing of the flower-women turned to a wild and sweet and voluptuous singing, like that of the Lorelei. By this token, tbe enchanter knew that his presence had been detected. Inured though he was to such bewitchments, he found himself far from insensible to the perilous luring of the voices. Contrary to his intention, forgetful of the danger, he emerged from the lee of the lichen-crested rocks. By insidious degrees, the melody fired his blood with a strange intoxication, it sang in his brain like some bewildering wine. Step by step, with a temporary loss of prudence for which, later, he was quite unable to account, he approached the blossoms.\n\nNow, pausing at an interval that he deemed safe in his bemusement, he beheld plainly the half-human features of the vampires, leaning toward him with fantastic invitation. Their weirdly slanted eyes, like oblong opals of dew and venom, the snaky coiling of their bronze-green hair, the bright, baneful scarlet of their lips, that thirsted subtly even as they sang, awoke within him the knowledge of his peril. Too late, he sought to defy the captiously woven spell. Unwinding with a movement swift as light, the long pale tendrils of one of the creatures wrapped him round, and he was drawn, resisting vainly, toward her couch.\n\nAt the moment of his capture, the whole sisterhood had ceased their singing. They began to utter little cries of triumph, shrill and sibilant. Murmurs of expectation, like the purrings of hungry flame, arose from the nearest, who hoped to share in the good fortune of the sorcerer's captress.\n\nMaal Dweb, however, was now able to utilize his faculties. Without alarm or fear, he contemplated the lovely monster who had drawn him to the verge of her velvet bed, and was fawning upon him with sinisterly parted lips.\n\nUsing a somewhat primary power of divination, he apprised himself of certain matters concerning the vampire. Having learnt the true, occult name which this creature. shared with all others of her kind, he then spoke the name aloud in a firm but gentle tone; and winning thus, by an elemental law of magic, the power of mastery over his captress and her sisters, he felt the instant relaxation of the tendrils. The flower-woman, with fear and wonder in her strange eyes, drew back like a startled lamia; but Maal Dweb, employing the half-articulate sounds of her own language, began to soothe and reassure her. In a little while he was on friendly terms with the whole sisterhood. These simple and naive beings forgot their vampire intentions, their surprise and wonderment, and seemed to accept the magician very much as they accepted the three suns and the meteoric conditions of the planet Votalp.\n\nConversing with them, he soon verified the information obtained through the mimic globe. As a rule their emotions and memories were short-lived, their nature being closer to that of plants or animals than of humankind; but the loss of five sisters, occurring on successive mornings, had filled them with grief and terror that they could not forget. The missing flowers had been carried away bodily. The depredators were certain reptilian beings, colossal in size and winged like pterodactyls, who came down from their new-built citadel among the mountains at the valley's upper extreme. These beings, known as the Ispazars, seven in number, had become formidable sorcerers and had developed an intellection beyond that of their kind, together with many esoteric faculties. Preserving the cold and evilly cryptic nature of reptiles, they had made themselves the masters of an abhuman science. But, until the present, Maal Dweb had ignored them and had not thought it worth while to interfere with their evolution.\n\nNow, through an errant whim, in his search for adventure, he had decided to pit himself against the Ispazars, employing no other weapons of sorcery than his own wit and will, his remembered learning, his clairvoyance, and the two simple amulets that he wore on his person.\n\n'Be comforted,' he said to the flower-women, 'for verily I shall deal with these miscreants in a fitting manner.'\n\nAt this; they broke into a shrill babble, repeating tales the bird-people of the valley had told them regarding the fortress of the Ispazars, whose walls rose sheerly from a hidden peak unscaled by man, and were void of portal or window save in the highmost ramparts, where the flying reptiles went in and out. And they told him other tales, concerning the ferocity and cruelty of the Ispazars...\n\nSmiling as if at the chatter of children, he diverted their thoughts to other matters, and told them many stories of odd and curious marvels, and queer happenings in alien worlds. In the meanwhile he perfected his plan for obtaining entrance to the citadel of the reptilian wizards.\n\nThe day went by in such divertissements; and one by one the three suns of the system fell beyond the valley's rim. The flower-women grew inattentive, they began to nod and drowse in the richly darkening twilight; and Maal Dweb proceeded with certain preparations that formed an essential part of his scheme.\n\nThrough his power of second-sight, he had determined the identity of the victim whom the reptiles would carry away in their next raid, on the morrow. This creature, as it happened, was the one who had sought to ensnare him. Like the others, she was now preparing to fold herself for the night in her voluminous couch of petals. Confiding part of his plan to her, Maal Dweb manipulated in a singular fashion. one of the amulets which he wore, and by virtue of this manipulation, reduced himself to the proportions of a pigmy. In this state, with the assistance of the drowsy siren, he was able to conceal himself in a hollow space among the petals; and thus embowered. like a bee in a rose he slept securely through the short, moonless night of Votalp.\n\nThe dawn awakened him, glowing as if through lucent curtains of ruby and purple. He heard the flower-women murmuring sleepily to one another as they opened their blossoms to the early suns. Their murmurs, however, soon changed into shrill cries of agitation and fear; and above the cries, there came a vibrant drumming as of great dragonwings. He peered from his hiding-place and saw in the double dawn the descent of the Ispazars, from whose webbed vans a darkness fell on the valley. Nearer they drew, and he saw their cold and scarlet eyes beneath scaly brows, their long, undulant bodies, their lizard limbs, and prehensile claws; and he heard the deep, articulate hissing of their voices. Then the petals closed about him blindly, shuddering and constrictive, as the flower-women recoiled from the swooping monsters. All was confusion, terror, tumult; but he knew, from his observation of the previous rape, that two of the Ispazars had encircled the flower's stem with their python-like tails, and were pulling it from the ground as a human sorcerer might pull a mandrake plant.\n\nHe felt the convulsive agony of the disrooted blossom, he heard the lamentable shrieking of her sisters. Then there came a heavier beating of the drum-loud wings, and the feeling of giddy ascension and flight.\n\nThrough all this, Maal Dweb maintained the utmost presence of mind; and he did not betray himself to the Ispazars. After many minutes, there was a slackening of the headlong flight, and he knew that the reptiles were nearing their citadel. A moment more, and the ruddy gloom of the shut petals darkened and purpled about him as if they had peered from the sunlight into a place of deep shadow. The thrumming of wings ceased abruptly, the living flower was dropped from a height on some hard surface and Maal Dweb was nearly hurled from his hiding place by the violence of her fall. Moaning faintly, twitching a little, she lay where her captors had flung her. The enchanter heard the hissing voices of the reptile wizards, the rough, sharp slithering of their tails on a stone floor, as they withdrew.\n\nWhispering words of comfort to the dying blossom, he felt the petals relax about him. He crept forth very cautiously, and found himself in an immense, gloomily vaulted hall, whose windows were like the mouths of a deep cavern. The place was a sort of alchemy, a den of alien sorceries and abhorrent pharmaceutics. Everywhere, in the gloom, there were vats, cupels, furnaces, alembics, and matrasses of unhuman form, bulking and towering colossally to the pigmy eyes of Maal Dweb. Close at hand, a monstrous cauldron fumed like a crater of black metal, its curving sides ascending far above the magician's head. None of the Ispazars was in sight; but, knowing that they might resume at any moment, he hastened to make ready against them, feeling, for the first time in many years, the thrill of peril and expectation.\n\nManipulating the second amulet, he regained his normal proportions. The room, though still spacious, was no longer a hall of giants, and the cauldron beside him sank and lessened till its rim rose only to his shoulder. He saw now that the cauldron was filled with an unholy mixture of ingredients, among which were finely shredded portions of the missing flower-women, together with the gall of chimeras and the ambergris of leviathans. Heated by unseen fires, it boiled tumultuously, foaming with black, pitchy bubbles, and putting forth a nauseous vapor.\n\nWith the shrewd eye of a past master of all chemic lore, Maal Dweb proceeded to estimate the cauldron's various contents, and was then able to divine the purpose for which the brewage was intended. The conclusion to which he was driven appalled him slightly, and served to heighten his respect for the power and science of the reptile sorcerers. He saw, indeed, that it would be highly advisable to arrest their evolution.\n\nAfter brief reflection, it occurred to him that, in accordance with chemical laws, the adding of certain simple components to the brewage would bring about, an eventuation neither desired nor anticipated by the Ispazars. On high tables about the walls of the alchemy, there were jars, flasks, and vials containing subtle drugs and powerful elements, some of which were drawn from the more arcanic kingdoms of nature. Disregarding the moon-powder, the coals of starfire, the jellies made from the brains of gorgons, the ichor of salamanders, the dust of lethal fungi, the marrow of sphinxes, and other equally quaint and pernicious matters, the magician soon found the essences that he required. It was the work of an instant to pour them into the seething cauldron; and having done this, he awaited with composure. the return of the reptiles.\n\nThe flower-woman, in the meanwhile, had ceased to moan and twitch. Maal Dweb knew that she was dead, since beings of this genus were unable to survive when uprooted with such violence from their natal soil. She had folded herself to the face in her straitened petals, as if in a red and blackening shroud. He regarded her briefly, not without commiseration; and at that moment he heard the voices of the seven Ispazars, who had now re-entered the alchemy.\n\nThey came toward him among the crowded vessels, walking erect in the fashion of men on their short lizard legs, their ribbed and sabled wings retracted behind them, and their eyes glaring redly in the gloom. Two of them were armed with long, sinuous-bladed knives; and others were equipped with enormous adamantine pestles, to be employed, no doubt, in bruising the flesh of the floral vampire.\n\nWhen they saw the enchanter; they were both startled and angered. Their necks and torsos began to swell like the hoods of cobras, and a great hissing rose among them, like the noise of jetted steam. Their aspect would have struck terror to the heart of any common man; but Maal Dweb confronted them calmly, repeating aloud, in low, even tones, a word of sovereign protective power.\n\nThe Ispazars hurled themselves toward him, some running along the floor with an undulant slithering motion, and others rising on rapid-beating vans to attack him from above. All, however, dashed themselves vainly on the sphere of unseen force he had drawn about him through the utterance of the word of power. It was a strange thing to see them clawing vengefully at the void air, or striking futile, blows with their weapons, which rang as if on a brazen wall.\n\nNow, perceiving that the man before them was a sorcerer, the reptile magicians began to make use of their own abhuman sorcery. They called from the air great bolts of livid flame, python-shapen, which leaped and writhed incessantly, warring with the sphere of protective power, driving it back as a shield is driven by press of numbers in battle, but never breaking it down entirely. Also, they chanted evil, siblant runes that were designed to charm away the magician's memory, and cause him to forget his magic. Sore was the travail of Maal Dweb as he fought the serpent fires and runes; and blood mingled with the sweat of his brow from that endeavor. But still, as the bolts struck nearer and the singing loudened, he kept uttering the unforgotten word; and the word still protected him.\n\nNow, above the snaky chanting, he heard the deep hiss of the cauldron, boiling more turbulently than before because of those matters which he had added to its contents. And he saw, between the ever-writhing bolts, that a more voluminous vapor, dark as the steam of a primal fen, was mounting from the cauldron and spreading throughout the alchemy.\n\nSoon the Ispazars were immersed in the fumes, as in a cloud of darkness; and dimly they began to coil and twist, convulsed with a strange agony. The python flames died out on the air; and the hissings of the Ispazars became inarticulate as those of common serpents. Then falling to the floor, while the black mist gathered and thickened above them, they crawled to and fro on their bellies in the fashion of true reptiles; and, emerging at times from the vapor, they shrank and dwindled as if hell-fire had consumed them.\n\nAll this was even as Maal Dweb had planned. He knew that the Ispazars had forgotten their sorcery and science; and a swift devolution, flinging them back to the lowest state of serpenthood, had come upon them through the action of the vapor. But, before the completion of the change, he admitted one of the seven Ispazars to the sphere that now served to protect him from the fumes. The creature fawned at his feet like a tame dragon, acknowledging him for its master. Then, presently, the cloud of vapor began to lift, and he saw the other Ispazars, who were now little larger than fen-snakes. Their wings had withered into useless frills, and they crept and hissed on the floor, amid the alembics and crucibles and athanors of their lost science.\n\nMaal Dweb regarded them for a little, not without pride in his own sorcery. The struggle had been difficult, even dangerous; and he reflected that his boredom had been thoroughly overcome, at least for the nonce. From a practical standpoint, he had done well; for, in ridding the flower- women of their persecutors, he had also eradicated a possible future menace to his own dominion over the worlds of the three suns.\n\nTurning to that Ispazar which he had spared for a necessary purpose, he seated himself firmly astride its back, behind the thick jointing of the vans. He spoke a magic word that was understood by the monster. Bearing him between its wings, it rose and flew obediently through one of the windows; and, leaving behind it for ever the citadel that was not to be scaled by man, nor by any wingless creature, it carried the magician over the red horns of the sable mountains, across the valley where dwelt the sisterhood of floral vampires, and descended on the mossy knoll at the end of that silver drawbridge whereby he had entered Votalp. There Maal Dweb dismounted; and, followed by the crawling Ispazar, he began his return journey to Xiccarph through the hueless cloud, above the multi-dimensional deeps.\n\nMidway in that pecular transit, he heard a sharp, sudden clapping of wings. It ceased with remarkable abruptness, and was not repeated. Looking back, he found that the Ispazar had fallen from the bridge, and was vanishing brokenly amid irreconcilable angles, in the gulf from which there was no return.",

        "title_cn": "约-冯比斯的坟窟",
        "title": "The Vaults of Yoh-Vombis",
        "content": "PREFACE\n\nAs an interne in the terrestrial hospital at Ignarh, I had charge of the singular case of Rodney Severn, the one surviving member of the Octave Expedition to Yoh-Vombis, and took down the following story from his dictation. Severn had been brought to the hospital by the Martian guides of the Expedition. He was suffering from a horribly lacerated and inflamed condition of the scalp and brow, and was wildly delirious part of the time and had to be held down in his bed during recurrent seizures of a mania whose violence was doubly inexplicable in view of his extreme debility.\n\nThe lacerations, as will be learned from the story, were mainly self-inflicted. They were mingled with numerous small round wounds, easily distinguished from the knife-slashes, and arranged in regular circles, through which an unknown poison had been injected into Severn’s scalp. The causation of these wounds was difficult to explain; unless one were to believe that Severn’s story was true, and was no mere figment of his illness. Speaking for myself, in the light of what afterwards occurred, I feel that I have no other recourse than to believe it. There are strange things on the red planet; and I can only second the wish that was expressed by the doomed archaeologist in regard to future explorations.\n\nThe night after he finished telling me his story, while another doctor than myself was supposedly on duty, Severn managed to escape from the hospital, doubtless in one of the strange seizures at which I have hinted: a most astonishing thing, for he had seemed weaker than ever after the long strain of his terrible narrative, and his demise had been hourly expected. More astonishing still, his bare footsteps were found in the desert, going toward Yoh-Vombis, till they vanished in the path of a light sand-storm; but no trace of Severn himself has yet been discovered.\n\nTHE NARRATIVE OF RODNEY SEVERN\n\nIf the doctors are correct in their prognostication, I have only a few Martian hours of life remaining to me. In those hours I shall endeavor to relate, as a warning to others who might follow in our footsteps, the singular and frightful happenings that terminated our researches among the ruins of Yoh-Vombis. Somehow, even in my extremity, I shall contrive to tell the story; since there is no one else to do it. But the telling will be toilsome and broken; and after I am done, the madness will recur, and several men will restrain me, lest I should leave the hospital and return across many desert leagues to those abominable vaults beneath the compulsion of the malignant and malevolent virus which is permeating my brain. Perhaps death will release me from that abhorrent control, which would urge me down to bottomless underworld warrens of terror for which the saner planets of the solar system can have no analogue. I say perhaps . . . for, remembering what I have seen, I am not sure that even death will end my bondage. . . .\n\nperhaps . . .\n\nThere were eight of us, professional archaeologists with more or less terrene and interplanetary experience, who set forth with native guides from Ignarh, the commercial metropolis of Mars, to inspect that ancient, aeon-deserted city. Allan Octave, our official leader, held his primacy by virtue of knowing more about Martian archaeology than any other Terrestrial on the planet; and others of the party, such as William Harper and Jonas Halgren, had been associated with him in many of his previous researches. I, Rodney Severn, was more of a newcomer, having spent but a few months on Mars; and the greater part of my own ultra-terrene delvings had been confined to Venus.\n\n\n\nI had often heard of Yoh-Vombis, in a vague and legendary sort of manner, and never at first hand. Even the ubiquitous Octave had never seen it. Builded by an extinct people whose history has been lost in the latter, decadent eras of the planet, it remains a dim and fascinating riddle whose solution has never been approached . . . and which, I trust, may endure forevermore unsolved by man. Certainly I hope that no one will ever follow in our steps. . . .\n\nContrary to the impression we had received from Martian stories, we found that the semi-fabulous ruins lay at no great distance from Ignarh with its terrestrial colony and consulates. The nude, spongy-chested natives had spoken deterringly of vast deserts filled with ever-swirling sand-storms, through which we must pass to reach Yoh-Vombis; and in spite of our munificent offers of payment, it had been difficult to secure guides for the journey. We had provisioned ourselves amply and had prepared for all emergencies that might eventuate during a long trip. Therefore, we were pleased as well as surprised when we came to the ruins after seven hours of plodding across the flat, treeless, orange-yellow desolation to the south-west of Ignarh. On account of the lesser gravity, the journey was far less tiring than one who is unfamiliar with Martian conditions might expect. But because of the thin, Himalaya-like air, and the possible strain on our hearts, we had been careful not to hasten.\n\nOur coming to Yoh-Vombis was sudden and spectacular. Climbing the low slope of a league-long elevation of bare and deeply eroded stone, we saw before us the shattered walls of our destination, whose highest tower was notching the small, remote sun that glared in stifled crimson through the floating haze of fine sand. For a little, we thought that the domeless, three-angled towers and broken-down monoliths were those of some unlegended city, other than the one we sought. But the disposition of the ruins, which lay in a sort of arc for almost the entire extent of the low and gneissic elevation, together with the type of architecture, soon convinced us that we had found our goal. No other ancient city on Mars had been laid out in that manner; and the strange, many-terraced buttresses of the thick walls, like the stairways of forgotten Anakim,1 were peculiar to the prehistoric race that had built Yoh-Vombis. Moreover, Yoh-Vombis was the one remaining example of this architecture, aside from a few fragments in the neighborhood of Ignarh, which we had previously examined.\n\n1\n\nI have seen the hoary, sky-confronting walls of Macchu Pichu2 amid the desolate Andes, and the teocallis that are buried in the Mexican jungles. And I have seen the frozen, giant-builded battlements of Uogam on the glacial tundras of the nightward hemisphere of Venus. But these were as things of yesteryear, bearing at least the memory or the intimation of life, compared with the awesome and lethiferous3 antiquity, the cycle-enduring doom of a petrified sterility, that seemed to invest Yoh-Vombis. The whole region was far from the life-giving canals beyond whose environs even the more noxious flora and fauna are seldom found; and we had seen no living thing since our departure from Ignarh. But here, in this place of eternal bareness and solitude, it seemed that life could never have been. The stark, eroded stones were things that might have been reared by the toil of the dead, to house the monstrous ghouls and demons of primal desolation.\n\n2\n\n3\n\nI think we all received the same impression as we stood staring in silence while the pale, sanies-like sunset fell on the dark and megalithic ruins. I remember gasping a little, in an air that seemed to have been touched by the irrespirable chill of death; and I heard the same sharp, laborious intake of breath from others of our party.\n\n“That place is deader than an Egyptian morgue,” observed Harper.\n\n“Certainly it is far more ancient,” Octave assented. “According to the most reliable legends, the Yorhis, who built Yoh-Vombis, were wiped out by the present ruling race at least forty thousand years ago.”\n\n“There’s a story, isn’t there,” said Harper, “that the last remnant of the Yorhis was destroyed by some unknown agency—something too horrible and outré to be mentioned even in a myth?”\n\n“Of course, I’ve heard that legend,” agreed Octave. “Maybe we’ll find evidence among the ruins, to prove or disprove it. The Yorhis may have been cleaned out by some terrible epidemic, such as the Yashta pestilence, which was a kind of green mould that ate all the bones of the body, starting with the teeth and nails. But we needn’t be afraid of getting it, if there are any mummies in Yoh-Vombis—the bacteria will all be dead as their victims, after so many cycles of planetary desiccation. Anyway, there ought to be a lot for us to learn. The Aihais have always been more or less shy of the place. Few have ever visited it: and none, as far as I can find, have made a thorough examination of the ruins.”\n\nThe sun had gone down with uncanny swiftness, as if it had disappeared through some sort of prestigitation rather than the normal process of setting. We felt the instant chill of the blue-green twilight: and the ether above us was like a huge, transparent dome of sunless ice, shot with a million bleak sparklings that were the stars. We donned the coats and helmets of Martian fur, which must always be worn at night; and going on to westward of the walls, we established our camp in their lee, so that we might be sheltered a little from the jaar, that cruel desert wind that always blows from the east before dawn. Then, lighting the alcohol lamps that had been brought along for cooking purposes, we huddled around them while the evening meal was prepared and eaten.\n\njaar,\n\nAfterwards, for comfort rather than because of weariness, we retired early to our sleeping-bags; and the two Aihais, our guides, wrapped themselves in the cerement-like folds of grey bassa-cloth which are all the protection their leathery skins appear to require even in sub-zero temperatures.\n\nbassa\n\nEven in my thick, double-lined bag, I still felt the rigor of the night air; and I am sure it was this, rather than anything else, which kept me awake for a long while and rendered my eventual slumber somewhat restless and broken. Of course, the strangeness of our situation, and the weird proximity of those aeonian walls and towers may in some measure have contributed to my unrest. But at any rate, I was not troubled by even the least presentiment of alarm or danger; and I should have laughed at the idea that anything of peril could lurk in Yoh-Vombis, amid whose undreamable and stupefying antiquities the very phantoms of its dead must long since have faded into nothingness.\n\nI remember little, however, except the feeling of interminable duration that often marks a shallow and interrupted sleep. I recall the marrow-piercing wind that moaned above us toward midnight, and the sand that stung my face like a fine hail as it passed, blowing from desert to immemorial desert; and I recall the still, inflexible stars that grew dim for awhile with that fleeing ancient dust. Then the wind went by; and I drowsed again, with starts of semi-wakefulness. At last, in one of these, I knew vaguely that the small twin moons, Phobos and Deimos, had risen and were making huge and spectral shadows with the ruins and were casting an ashen glimmer on the shrouded forms of my companions.\n\nI must have been half-asleep; for the memory of that which I saw is doubtful as any dream. I watched beneath drooping lids the tiny moons that had topped the domeless triangular towers; and I saw the far-flung shadows that almost touched the bodies of my fellow-archaeologists.\n\nThe whole scene was locked in a petrific stillness; and none of the sleepers stirred. Then, as my lids were about to close, I received an impression of movement in the frozen gloom; and it seemed to me that a portion of the foremost shadow had detached itself and was crawling toward Octave, who lay nearer to the ruins than we others.\n\nEven through my heavy lethargy, I was disturbed by a warning of something unnatural and perhaps ominous. I started to sit up; and even as I moved, the shadowy object, whatever it was, drew back and became merged once more in the greater shadow. Its vanishment startled me into full wakefulness; and yet I could not be sure that I had actually seen the thing. In that brief, final glimpse, it had seemed like a roughly circular piece of cloth or leather, dark and crumpled,4 and twelve or fourteen inches in diameter, that ran along the ground with the doubling movement of an inch-worm, causing it to fold and unfold in a startling manner as it went.\n\n4\n\nI did not go to sleep again for nearly an hour; and if it had not been for the extreme cold, I should doubtless have gotten up to investigate and make sure whether I had really beheld an object of such bizarre nature or had merely dreamt it. I lay staring at the deep ebon shadow in which it had disappeared, while a series of fanciful wonderings followed each other in antic procession through my mind. Even then, though somewhat perturbed, I was not aware of any actual fear or intuition of possible menace. And more and more I began to convince myself that the thing was too unlikely and fantastical to have been anything but the figment of a dream. And at last I nodded off into light slumber.\n\nThe chill, demoniac sighing of the jaar across the jagged walls awoke me, and I saw that the faint moonlight had received the hueless accession of early dawn. We all arose, and prepared our breakfast with fingers that grew numb in spite of the spirit-lamps. Then, shivering, we ate, while the sun leapt over the horizon like a juggler’s ball. Enormous, gaunt, without gradations of shadow or luminosity, the ruins beetled before us in the thin light, like the mausolea of primordial giants, that abide from darkness-eaten aeons to confront the last dawn of an expiring orb.\n\njaar\n\nMy queer visual experience during the night had taken on more than ever a fantasmagoric unreality; and I gave it no more than a passing thought and did not speak of it to the others. But, even as the faint, distorted shadows of slumber often tinge one’s waking hours, it may have contributed to the nameless mood in which I found myself: a mood in which I felt the unhuman alienage of our surroundings and the black, fathomless antiquity of the ruins like an almost unbearable oppression. The feeling seemed to be made of a million spectral adumbrations that oozed unseen but palpable from the great, unearthly architecture; that weighed upon me like tomb-born incubi, but were void of form and meaning such as could be comprehended by human thought. I appeared to move, not in the open air, but in the smothering gloom of sealed sepulchral vaults; to choke with a death-fraught atmosphere, with the miasmata of aeon-old corruption.\n\nMy companions were all eager to explore the ruins; and of course it was impossible for me to even mention the apparently absurd and baseless shadows of my mood. Human beings on other worlds than their own are often subject to nervous and psychic symptoms of this sort, engendered by the unfamiliar forces, the novel radiations of their environment. But, as we approached the buildings in our preliminary tour of examination, I lagged behind the others, seized by a paralyzing panic that left me unable to move or breathe for a few moments. A dark, freezing clamminess seemed to pervade my brain and muscles and suspend their inmost working. Then it lifted; and I was free to go on and follow the others.\n\nStrangely, as it seemed, the two Martians refused to accompany us. Stolid and taciturn, they gave no explicit reason; but evidently nothing would induce them to enter Yoh-Vombis. Whether or not they were afraid of the ruins, we were unable to determine: their enigmatic faces, with the small oblique eyes and huge, flaring nostrils, betrayed neither fear nor any other emotion intelligible to man. In reply to our questions, they merely said that no Aihai had set foot among the ruins for ages. Apparently there was some mysterious tabu in connection with the place.\n\nFor equipment in that preliminary tour, we took along only a crowbar and two picks. Our other tools, and some cartridges of high explosives, we left at our camp, to be used later if necessary, after we had surveyed the ground. One or two of us owned automatics: but these also were left behind; for it seemed absurd to imagine that any form of life would be encountered among the ruins.\n\nOctave was visibly excited as we began our inspection, and maintained a running-fire of exclamatory comment. The rest of us were subdued and silent; and I think that my own feeling, in a measure, was shared by many of the others. It was impossible to shake off the somber awe and wonder that fell upon us from those megalithic stones.\n\nI have no time to describe the ruins minutely, but must hasten on with my story. There is much that I could not describe anyway; for the main area of the city was destined to remain unexplored.\n\nWe went on for some distance among the triangular, terraced buildings, following the zig-zag streets that conformed to this peculiar architecture. Most of the towers were more or less dilapidated; and everywhere we saw the deep erosion wrought by cycles of blowing wind and sand, which, in many cases, had worn into roundness the sharp angles of the mighty walls. We entered some of the towers through high, narrow doorways, but found utter emptiness within. Whatever they had contained in the way of furnishings must long ago have crumbled into dust; and the dust had been blown away by the searching desert gales. On some of the outer walls, there was evidence of carving or lettering;5 but all of it was so worn down and obliterated by time that we could trace only a few fragmentary outlines, of which we could make nothing.\n\n5\n\nAt length we came to a wide thoroughfare, which ended in the wall of a vast terrace, several hundred yards long by perhaps forty in height, on which the central buildings were grouped like a sort of citadel or acropolis. A flight of broken steps, designed for longer limbs than those of men or even the gangling modern Martians, afforded access to the terrace, which had seemingly been hewn from the plateau itself.\n\nPausing, we decided to defer our investigation of the higher buildings, which, being more exposed than the others, were doubly ruinous and dilapidated, and in all likelihood would offer little for our trouble. Octave had begun to voice his disappointment over our failure to find anything in the nature of artifacts or carvings that would throw light on the history of Yoh-Vombis.\n\nThen, a little to the right of the stairway, we perceived an entrance in the main wall, half-choked with ancient debris. Behind the heap of detritus, we found the beginning of a downward flight of steps. Darkness poured from the opening like a visible flood, noisome and musty with primordial stagnancies of decay; and we could see nothing below the first steps, which gave the appearance of being suspended over a black gulf.\n\nOctave and myself and several others had brought along electric torches, in case we should need them in our explorations. It had occurred to us that there might be subterranean vaults or catacombs in Yoh-Vombis, even as in the latter-day cities of Mars, which are often more extensive underground than above; and such vaults would be the likeliest place in which to look for vestiges of the Yorhi civilization.\n\nThrowing his torch-beam into the abyss, Octave began to descend the stairs. His eager voice called us to follow.\n\nAgain, for an instant, the unknown, irrational panic froze my faculties, and I hesitated while the others pressed forward behind me. Then, as before, the terror passed; and I wondered at myself for being overcome by anything so absurd and unfounded. I followed Octave down the steps, and the others came trooping after me.\n\nAt the bottom of the high, awkward steps, we found ourselves in a long and roomy vault, like a subterranean hallway. Its floor was deep with siftings of immemorial dust; and in places there were heaps of a coarse grey powder, such as might be left by the decomposition of certain fungi that grow in the Martian catacombs, under the canals. Such fungi, at one time, might conceivably have existed in Yoh-Vombis; but, owing to the prolonged and excessive dehydration, they must have died out long ago. Nothing, surely, not even a fungus, could have lived in those arid vaults for many aeons past.\n\nThe air was singularly heavy, as if the lees of an ancient atmosphere, less tenuous than that of Mars today, had settled down and remained in that stagnant darkness. It was harder to breathe than the outer air; it was filled with unknown effluvia; and the light dust arose before us at every step, diffusing a faintness of bygone corruption, like the dust of powdered mummies.\n\nAt the end of the vault, before a strait and lofty doorway our torches revealed an immense shallow urn or pan, supported on short cube-shaped legs, and wrought from a dull blackish-green material which suggested some bizarre alloy of metal and porcelain. The thing was about four feet across, with a thick rim adorned by writhing indecipherable figures, deeply etched as if by acid. In the bottom of the bowl we perceived a deposit of dark and cinder-like fragments, which gave off a slight but disagreeable pungence, like the phantom of some more powerful odor. Octave, bending over the rim began to cough and sneeze as he inhaled it.\n\n“That stuff, whatever it was, must have been a pretty strong fumigant,” he observed. “The people of Yoh-Vombis may have used it to disinfect the vaults.”\n\nThe doorway beyond the shallow urn admitted us to a larger chamber, whose floor was comparatively free of dust. We found that the dark stone beneath our feet was marked off in multiform geometric patterns, traced with ochreous ore, amid which, as in Egyptian cartouches, hieroglyphics and highly formalized drawings were enclosed. We could make little from most of them; but the figures in many were doubtless designed to represent the Yorhis themselves. Like the Aihais, they were tall and angular, with great bellows-like chests; and they were depicted as possessing a supplementary third arm, which issued from the bosom; a characteristic which, in vestigial form, sometimes occurs among the Aihais. The ears and nostrils, as far as we could judge, were not so huge and flaring as those of the modern Martians. All of these Yorhis were represented as being nude; but in one of the cartouches, done in a far hastier style than the others, we perceived two figures whose high, conical craniums were wrapped in what seemed to be a sort of turban, which they were about to remove or adjust. The artist seemed to have laid a peculiar emphasis on the odd gesture with which the sinuous, four-jointed fingers were plucking at these head-dresses; and the whole posture was unexplainably contorted.\n\nFrom the second vault, passages ramified in all directions, leading to a veritable warren of catacombs. Here, enormous pot-bellied urns of the same material as the fumigating-pan, but taller than a man’s head and fitted with angular-handled stoppers, were ranged in solemn rows along the walls, leaving scant room for two of us to walk abreast. When we succeeded in removing one of the huge stoppers, we saw that the jar was filled to the rim with ashes and charred fragments of bone. Doubtless (as is still the Martian custom) the Yorhis had stored the cremated remains of whole families in single urns.\n\nEven Octave became silent as we went on; and a sort of meditative awe seemed to replace his former excitement. We others, I think, were utterly weighed down to a man by the solid gloom of a concept-defying antiquity, into which it seemed that we were going further and further at every step.\n\nThe shadows fluttered before us like the monstrous and misshapen wings of phantom bats. There was nothing anywhere but the atom-like dust of ages, and the jars that held the ashes of a long-extinct people. But, clinging to the high roof in one of the further vaults, I saw a dark and corrugated patch of circular form, like a withered fungus. It was impossible to reach the thing; and we went on after peering at it with many futile conjectures. Oddly enough, I failed to remember at that moment the crumpled, shadowy object I had seen or dreamt the night before.\n\nI have no idea how far we had gone, when we came to the last vault; but it seemed that we had been wandering for ages in that forgotten underworld. The air was growing fouler and more irrespirable, with a thick, sodden quality, as if from a sediment of material rottenness; and we had about decided to turn back. Then, without warning, at the end of a long, urn-lined catacomb, we found ourselves confronted by a blank wall.\n\nHere, we came upon one of the strangest and most mystifying of our discoveries—a mummified and incredibly desiccated figure, standing erect against the wall. It was more than seven feet in height, of a brown, bituminous color, and was wholly nude except for a sort of black cowl that covered the upper head and drooped down at the sides in wrinkled folds. From the three arms, and general contour, it was plainly one of the ancient Yorhis—perhaps the sole member of this race whose body had remained intact.\n\nWe all felt an inexpressible thrill at the sheer age of this shrivelled thing, which, in the dry air of the vault, had endured through all the historic and geologic vicissitudes of the planet, to provide a visible link with lost cycles.\n\nThen, as we peered closer with our torches, we saw why the mummy had maintained an upright position. At ankles, knees, waist, shoulders and neck it was shackled to the wall by heavy metal bands, so deeply eaten and embrowned with a sort of rust that we had failed to distinguish them at first sight in the shadow. The strange cowl on the head, when closelier studied, continued to baffle us. It was covered with a fine, mould-like pile, unclean and dusty as ancient cobwebs. Something about it, I know not what, was abhorrent and revolting.\n\nwhy\n\n“By Jove! this is a real find!” ejaculated Octave, as he thrust his torch into the mummified face, where shadows moved like living things in the pit-deep hollows of the eyes and the huge triple nostrils and wide ears that flared upward beneath the cowl.\n\nStill lifting the torch, he put out his free hand and touched the body very lightly. Tentative as the touch had been, the lower part of the barrel-like torso, the legs, the hands and forearms all seemed to dissolve into powder, leaving the head and upper body and arms still hanging in their metal fetters. The progress of decay had been queerly unequal, for the remnant portions gave no sign of disintegration.\n\nOctave cried out in dismay, and then began to cough and sneeze, as the cloud of brown powder, floating with airy lightness, enveloped him. We others all stepped back to avoid the powder. Then, above the spreading cloud, I saw an unbelievable thing. The black cowl on the mummy’s head began to curl and twitch upward at the corners, it writhed with a verminous motion, it fell from the withered cranium, seeming to fold and unfold convulsively in mid-air as it fell. Then it dropped on the bare head of Octave who, in his disconcertment at the crumbling of the mummy, had remained standing close to the wall. At that instant, in a start of profound terror, I remembered the thing that had inched itself from the shadows of Yoh-Vombis in the light of the twin moons, and had drawn back like a figment of slumber at my first waking movement.\n\nCleaving closely as a tightened cloth, the thing enfolded Octave’s hair and brow and eyes, and he shrieked wildly, with incoherent pleas for help, and tore with frantic fingers at the cowl, but failed to loosen it. Then his cries began to mount in a mad crescendo of agony, as if beneath some instrument of infernal torture; and he danced and capered blindly about the vault, eluding us with strange celerity as we all sprang forward in an effort to reach him and release him from his weird incumbrance. The whole happening was mysterious as a nightmare; but the thing that had fallen on his head was plainly some unclassified form of Martian life, which, contrary to all the known laws of science, had survived in those primordial catacombs. We must rescue him from its clutches if we could.\n\nWe tried to close in on the frenzied figure of our chief—which, in the far from roomy space between the last urns and the wall, should have been an easy matter. But, darting away, in a manner doubly incomprehensible because of his blindfolded condition, he circled about us and ran past, to disappear among the urns toward the outer labyrinth of intersecting catacombs.\n\n“My God! What has happened to him?” cried Harper. “The man acts as if he were possessed.”\n\nThere was obviously no time for a discussion of the enigma, and we all followed Octave as speedily as our astonishment would permit. We had lost sight of him in the darkness, and when we came to the first division of the vaults, we were doubtful as to which passage he had taken, till we heard a shrill scream, several times repeated, in a catacomb on the extreme left. There was a weird, unearthly quality in those screams, which may have been due to the long-stagnant air or the peculiar acoustics of the ramifying caverns. But somehow I could not imagine them as issuing from human lips—at least not from those of a living man. They seemed to contain a soulless, mechanical agony, as if they had been wrung from a devil-driven corpse.\n\nThrusting our torches before us into the lurching, fleeing shadows, we raced along between rows of mighty urns. The screaming had died away in sepulchral silence; but far off we heard the light and muffled thud of running feet. We followed in headlong pursuit; but, gasping painfully in the vitiated, miasmal air, we were soon compelled to slacken our pace without coming in sight of Octave. Very faintly, and further away than ever, like the tomb-swallowed steps of a phantom, we heard his vanishing footfalls. Then they ceased; and we heard nothing, except our own convulsive breathing, and the blood that throbbed in our temple-veins like steadily beaten drums of alarm.\n\nWe went on, dividing our party into three contingents when we came to a triple branching of the caverns. Harper and Halgren and myself took the middle passage; and after we had gone on for an endless interval without finding any trace of Octave, and had threaded our way through recesses piled to the roof with colossal urns that must have held the ashes of a hundred generations, we came out in the huge chamber with the geometric floor-designs. Here, very shortly, we were joined by the others, who had likewise failed to locate our missing leader.\n\nIt would be useless to detail our renewed and hour-long search of the myriad vaults, many of which we had not hitherto explored. All were empty, as far as any sign of life was concerned. I remember passing once more through the vault in which I had seen the dark, rounded patch on the ceiling, and noting with a shudder that the patch was gone. It was a miracle that we did not lose ourselves in that underworld maze; but at last we came back to the final catacomb in which we had found the shackled mummy.\n\nWe heard a measured and recurrent clangor as we neared the place—a most alarming and mystifying sound under the circumstances. It was like the hammering of ghouls on some forgotten mausoleum. When we drew nearer, the beams of our torches revealed a sight that was no less unexplainable than unexpected. A human figure, with its back toward us and the head concealed by a swollen black object that had the size and form of a sofa cushion, was standing near the remains of the mummy and was striking at the wall with a pointed metal bar. How long Octave had been there, and where he had found the bar, we could not know. But the blank wall had crumbled away beneath his furious blows, leaving on the floor a pile of cement-like fragments; and a small, narrow door, of the same ambiguous material as the cinerary urns and the fumigating-pan, had been laid bare.\n\nAmazed, uncertain, inexpressibly bewildered, we were all incapable of action or volition at that moment. The whole business was too fantastic and too horrifying, and it was plain that Octave had been overcome by some sort of madness. I, for one, felt the violent upsurge of sudden nausea when I had identified the loathsomely bloated thing that clung to Octave’s head and drooped in obscene tumescence on his neck. I did not dare to surmise the causation of its bloating.\n\nBefore any of us could recover our faculties, Octave flung aside the metal bar and began to fumble for something in the wall. It must have been a hidden spring; though how he could have known its location or existence is beyond all legitimate conjecture. With a dull, hideous grating, the uncovered door swung inward, thick and ponderous as a mausolean slab, leaving an aperture from which the nether midnight seemed to well like a flood of aeon-buried foulness. Somehow, at that instant, our electric torches appeared to flicker and grow dim; and we all breathed a suffocating fetor, like a draft from inner worlds of immemorial putrescence.\n\nOctave had turned toward us now, and he stood in an idle posture before the open door, like one who has finished some ordained task. I was the first of our party to throw off the paralyzing spell; and pulling out a clasp-knife—the only semblance of a weapon which I carried—I ran over to him. He moved back, but not quickly enough to evade me, when I stabbed with the four-inch blade at the black, turgescent mass that enveloped his whole upper head and hung down upon his eyes.\n\nWhat the thing was, I should prefer not to imagine—if it were possible to imagine. It was formless as a great slug, with neither head nor tail nor apparent organs—an unclean, puffy, leathery thing, covered with that fine, mould-like fur of which I have spoken. The knife tore into it as if through rotten parchment, making a long gash, and the horror appeared to collapse like a broken bladder. Out of it there gushed a sickening torrent of human blood, mingled with dark, filiated masses that may have been half-dissolved hair, and floating gelatinous lumps like molten bone, and shreds of a curdy white substance. At the same time, Octave began to stagger, and went down at full length on the floor. Disturbed by his fall, the mummy-dust arose about him in a curling cloud, beneath which he lay mortally still.\n\nConquering my revulsion, and choking with the dust, I bent over him and tore the flaccid, oozing horror from his head. It came with unexpected ease, as if I had removed a limp rag: but I wish to God that I had let it remain. Beneath, there was no longer a human cranium, for all had been eaten away, even to the eyebrows, and the half-devoured brain was laid bare as I lifted the cowl-like object. I dropped the unnamable thing from fingers that had grown suddenly nerveless, and it turned over as it fell, revealing on the nether side many rows of pinkish suckers, arranged in circles about a pallid disk that was covered with nerve-like filaments, suggesting a sort of plexus.\n\nMy companions had pressed forward behind me; but, for an appreciable interval, no one spoke.\n\n“How long do you suppose he has been dead?” It was Halgren who whispered the awful question, which we had all been asking ourselves. Apparently no one felt able or willing to answer it; and we could only stare in horrible, timeless fascination at Octave.\n\nAt length I made an effort to avert my gaze; and turning at random, I saw the remnants of the shackled mummy, and noted for the first time, with mechanical, unreal horror, the half-eaten condition of the withered head. From this, my gaze was diverted to the newly opened door at one side, without perceiving for a moment what had drawn my attention. Then, startled, I beheld beneath my torch, far down beyond the door, as if in some nether pit, a seething, multitudinous, worm-like movement of crawling shadows. They seemed to boil up in the darkness; and then, over the broad threshold of the vault, there poured the verminous vanguard of a countless army: things that were kindred to the monstrous, diabolic leech I had torn from Octave’s eaten head. Some were thin and flat, like writhing, doubling disks of cloth or leather, and others were more or less poddy, and crawled with glutted slowness. What they had found to feed on in the sealed, eternal midnight I do not know; and I pray that I never shall know.\n\nI sprang back and away from them, electrified with terror, sick with loathing, and the black army inched itself unendingly with nightmare swiftness from the unsealed abyss, like the nauseous vomit of horror-sated hells. As it poured toward us, burying Octave’s body from sight in a writhing wave, I saw a stir of life from the seemingly dead thing I had cast aside, and saw the loathly struggle which it made to right itself and join the others.\n\nBut neither I nor my companions could endure to look longer. We turned and ran between the mighty rows of urns, with the slithering mass of demon leeches close upon us, and scattered in blind panic when we came to the first division of the vaults. Heedless of each other or of anything but the urgency of flight, we plunged into the ramifying passages at random. Behind me, I heard someone stumble and go down, with a curse that mounted to an insane shrieking; but I knew that if I halted and went back, it would be only to invite the same baleful doom that had overtaken the hindmost of our party.\n\nStill clutching the electric torch and my open clasp-knife, I ran along a minor passage which, I seemed to remember, would conduct with more or less directness upon the large outer vault with the painted floor. Here I found myself alone. The others had kept to the main catacombs; and I heard far off a muffled babel of mad cries, as if several of them had been seized by their pursuers.\n\nIt seemed that I must have been mistaken about the direction of the passage; for it turned and twisted in an unfamiliar manner, with many intersections, and I soon found that I was lost in the black labyrinth, where the dust had lain unstirred by living feet for inestimable generations. The cinerary warren had grown still once more; and I heard my own frenzied panting, loud and stertorous as that of a Titan in the dead silence.\n\nSuddenly, as I went on, my torch disclosed a human figure coming toward me in the gloom. Before I could master my startlement, the figure had passed me with long, machine-like strides, as if returning to the inner vaults. I think it was Harper, since the height and build were about right for him; but I am not altogether sure, for the eyes and upper head were muffled by a dark, inflated cowl, and the pale lips locked as if in a silence of tetanic torture—or death. Whoever he was, he had dropped his torch; and he was running blindfold, in utter darkness, beneath the impulsion of that unearthly vampirism, to seek the very fountain-head of the unloosed horror. I knew that he was beyond human help; and I did not even dream of trying to stop him.\n\nTrembling violently, I resumed my flight, and was passed by two more of our party, stalking by with mechanical swiftness and sureness, and cowled with those Satanic leeches. The others must have returned by way of the main passages; for I did not meet them; and was never to see them again.\n\nThe remainder of my flight is a blur of pandemonian terror. Once more, after thinking that I was near the outer cavern, I found myself astray, and fled through a ranged eternity of monstrous urns, in vaults that must have extended for an unknown distance beyond our explorations. It seemed that I had gone on for years; and my lungs were choking with the aeon-dead air, and my legs were ready to crumble beneath me, when I saw far off a tiny point of blessed daylight. I ran toward it, with all the terrors of the alien darkness crowding behind me, and accursed shadows flittering before, and saw that the vault ended in a low, ruinous entrance, littered by rubble on which there fell an arc of thin sunshine.\n\nIt was another entrance than the one by which we had penetrated this lethal underworld. I was within a dozen feet of the opening when, without sound or other intimation, something dropped upon my head from the roof above, blinding me instantly and closing upon me like a tautened net. My brow and scalp, at the same time, were shot through with a million needle-like pangs—a manifold, ever-growing agony that seemed to pierce the very bone and converge from all sides upon my inmost brain.\n\nThe terror and suffering of that moment were worse than aught which the hells of earthly madness or delirium could ever contain. I felt the foul, vampiric clutch of an atrocious death—and of more than death.\n\nI believe that I dropped the torch: but the fingers of my right hand had still retained the open knife. Instinctively—since I was hardly capable of conscious volition—I raised the knife and slashed blindly, again and again, many times, at the thing that had fastened its deadly folds upon me. The blade must have gone through and through the clinging monstrosity, to gash my own flesh in a score of places; but I did not feel the pain of those wounds in the million-throbbing torment that possessed me.\n\nAt last I saw light, and saw that a black strip, loosened from above my eyes and dripping with my own blood, was hanging down my cheek. It writhed a little, even as it hung, and I ripped it away, and ripped the other remnants of the thing, tatter by oozing, bloody tatter, from off my brow and head. Then I staggered toward the entrance; and the wan light turned to a far, receding, dancing flame before me as I lurched and fell outside the cavern—a flame that fled like the last star of creation above the yawning, sliding chaos and oblivion into which I descended. . . .\n\nI am told that my unconsciousness was of brief duration. I came to myself, with the cryptic faces of the two Martian guides bending over me. My head was full of lancinating6 pains, and half-remembered terrors closed upon my mind like the shadows of mustering harpies. I rolled over, and looked back toward the cavern-mouth, from which the Martians, after finding me, had seemingly dragged me for some little distance. The mouth was under the terraced angle of an outer building, and within sight of our camp.\n\n6\n\nI stared at the black opening with hideous fascination, and descried a shadowy stirring in the gloom—the writhing, verminous movement of things that pressed forward from the darkness but did not emerge into the light. Doubtless they could not endure the sun, those creatures of ultramundane night and cycle-sealed corruption.\n\nIt was then that the ultimate horror, the beginning madness, came upon me. Amid my crawling revulsion, my nausea-prompted desire to flee from that seething cavern-mouth, there rose an abhorrently conflicting impulse to return; to thread my backward way through all the catacombs, as the others had done; to go down where never men save they, the inconceivably doomed and accursed, had ever gone; to seek beneath that damnable compulsion a nether world that human thought can never picture. There was a black light, a soundless calling, in the vaults of my brain: the implanted summons of the Thing, like a permeating and sorcerous poison. It lured me to the subterranean door that was walled up by the dying people of Yoh-Vombis, to immure those hellish and immortal leeches, those dark parasites that engraft their own abominable life on the half-eaten brains of the dead. It called me to the depths beyond, where dwell the noisome, necromantic Ones, of whom the leeches, with all their powers of vampirism and diabolism, are but the merest minions. . . .\n\nIt was only the two Aihais who prevented me from going back. I struggled, I fought them insanely as they strove to retard me with their spongy arms; but I must have been pretty thoroughly exhausted from all the superhuman adventures of the day; and I went down once more, after a little, into fathomless nothingness, from which I floated out at long intervals, to realize that I was being carried across the desert toward Ignarh.\n\nWell, that is all my story. I have tried to tell it fully and coherently, at a cost that would be unimaginable to the sane . . . to tell it before the madness falls upon me again, as it will very soon—as it is doing now. . . . Yes, I have told my story . . . and you have written it all out, haven’t you? Now I must go back to Yoh-Vombis . . . back across the desert and down through all the catacombs to the vaster vaults beneath. Something is in my brain, that commands me and will direct me . . . I tell you, I must go. . . .",
        "content_cn": "序章\n\n作为伊格纳赫行星医院的实习医师，我负责照料罗德尼·塞文这个特殊病例——他是前往约-冯比斯遗址的八人科考队中唯一的幸存者。以下文字皆根据他的口述记录而成。当火星向导将塞文送来医院时，他的头皮与前额布满骇人的撕裂伤与溃烂创口，间歇性谵妄发作时必须在病床上实施约束。尤其令人费解的是，这般狂暴症状竟出现在如此虚弱的躯体上。\n\n如后文所述，这些伤口多半是自残所致。但其中还混杂着许多规则排列的圆形小孔，明显区别于刀伤痕迹，某种未知毒素正是通过这些孔洞注入他的头皮。除非相信塞文所述皆为事实而非癔症妄想，否则这些伤痕根本无从解释。就我而言，鉴于后续事件的发展，除却采信他的故事外已别无选择。这颗红色星球上潜藏着太多诡谲之物，如今我只能附议那位考古学家临终前对后续探索者表达的警示。\n\n就在他完成叙述的当晚，趁我以外的医师当值时，塞文竟逃出了医院——这无疑是他在那些怪异发作期间的举动。此事尤为离奇，因完成那段恐怖叙述后，他本已虚弱得随时可能咽气。更骇人的是，沙漠中发现了他的赤足足迹，一路延伸向约-冯比斯方向，最终消逝在轻沙暴的轨迹里。而塞文本人至今下落不明。\n\n罗德尼·塞文亲述\n\n若医师们的诊断无误，我的生命仅余最后几个火星时。在这弥留之际，我将竭力讲述我们在约-冯比斯废墟遭遇的诡谲灾厄，以警示后来者。纵使濒临崩溃，我也必须完成这个使命——毕竟除我之外再无见证者。只是叙述过程必将支离破碎，待我言毕，癫狂定会再度袭来。届时需多人制住我，以免受脑中肆虐的邪毒驱使，穿越茫茫荒漠重返那些可憎的地底墓穴。或许死亡能解脱这恐怖的控制？那毒素正迫使我向往着深入地底的无尽恐怖巢穴——那是太阳系其他理性星球绝无对应的深渊。我说\"或许\"...因着所见所闻，我甚至不敢断言死亡真能终结这种奴役...或许...\n\n我们一行八人都是专业考古学家，或多或少有过地外考察经验。在火星商业都会伊格纳赫雇佣当地向导后，便启程探访那座被时光遗忘的古城。官方领队艾伦·奥克塔维凭借其冠绝全火星的地外考古学识获得领导权，威廉·哈珀与乔纳斯·哈尔格林等队员都曾多次与他共事。而我罗德尼·塞文资历尚浅，仅在火星驻留数月，此前地外考察多局限于金星。\n\n约-冯比斯之名于我向来只存在于模糊传说中，即便见多识广的奥克塔维也未曾亲临。这座由灭绝种族建造的古城，其历史早已湮没在火星衰败纪元的迷雾里，成为永恒难解的谜题...而我衷心祈愿它永远保持这个状态。但愿无人步我们后尘...\n\n与火星传说给人的印象相反，这座半传说性质的废墟距伊格纳赫的殖民区并不遥远。那些裸身扁胸的土著曾以漫天沙暴的荒漠劝阻我们，即便重金悬赏也难觅向导。我们备足物资以应对长途旅行的不测，因而当仅用七小时便穿越伊格纳赫西南那片平坦无树的橙黄荒原抵达废墟时，惊喜远多于诧异。得益于微弱重力，行程比预想轻松许多，但稀薄如喜马拉雅的大气层可能加重心脏负荷，我们始终控制着行进速度。\n\n约-冯比斯的出现突兀而慑人。当我们攀上裸露岩层构成的漫长缓坡，破碎的城墙突然闯入视野，最高处的尖塔正将黯淡红日切割成锯齿状的光斑。起初我们以为这是座无名古城，但弧状分布的废墟格局与独特的建筑形制很快确认了目标——那些阶梯状墙垛如同远古巨人遗落的阶梯，正是建造者种族的鲜明特征。除伊格纳赫周边零星残迹外，约-冯比斯是此类建筑仅存的完整样本。\n\n我曾见过安第斯山脉马丘比丘的苍老城墙，墨西哥丛林中掩埋的特奥蒂瓦坎金字塔，甚至金星永夜面冻原上巨人建造的乌奥加姆要塞。但与约-冯比斯令人窒息的死寂相比，那些遗迹至少残留着生命的余韵。这里远离滋养生命的运河区，自离开伊格纳赫便再未见过活物。在这永恒的荒芜中，仿佛生命从未存在过。那些风化严重的巨石，恍若亡者建造来栖息原始荒芜中的食尸鬼与恶魔。\n\n当苍白如腐脓的夕照笼罩这些黑色巨岩时，我相信所有人都感受到了相同的战栗。记得自己当时在弥漫着死亡寒意的空气中急促喘息，同伴们同样传来艰难的吸气声。\n\n\"这地方比埃及停尸间还死气沉沉。\"哈珀评论道。\n\n\"但远比那些遗迹古老。\"奥克塔维接话，\"据可靠传说，建造约-冯比斯的约尔希族早在四万年前就被现统治种族灭绝了。\"\n\n哈珀追问：\"不是还有个传说吗？关于约尔希最后遗民被某种难以名状的可怖力量清除？\"\n\n\"确实有此传说。\"奥克塔维承认，\"或许我们能找到实证。约尔希可能毁于类似亚什塔瘟疫的灾祸——那种会从牙齿指甲开始啃噬全身骨骼的绿霉。不过就算发现木乃伊也无须担心，经过这么多世纪早该脱水灭活了。总之这里定有重大发现。艾海族人向来避讳此地，几乎无人踏足，更不曾有过系统考察。\"\n\n太阳以诡谲的迅疾沉落，仿佛是通过某种障眼法而非自然过程消失的。我们立刻感受到蓝绿色暮霭带来的刺骨寒意：头顶的以太如同无日之冰构筑的透明巨穹，缀满百万颗阴森的星芒。我们披上必须夜间穿戴的火星毛皮外套与头盔，向西行至城墙背风处扎营，以躲避黎明前永远自东方袭来的残酷沙漠飓风——贾尔风。点燃用于烹饪的酒精灯后，我们蜷缩在火光周围准备并享用了晚餐。\n\n（贾尔）\n\n随后，更多出于舒适而非疲惫，我们早早钻入睡袋；两位艾海人向导则用裹尸布般的灰白色巴萨布将自己包裹——这种织物似乎足以保护他们皮革般的肌肤，即便在零下温度中亦然。\n\n（巴萨）\n\n即便裹在双层加厚的睡袋里，我仍能感受到夜气的凛冽；我确信正是这寒意令我久久无法入眠，最终陷入断续浅眠。当然，我们处境的诡异性，以及那些亘古城墙与塔楼近在咫尺的压迫感，或许也在某种程度上加剧了我的不安。但无论如何，我并未产生丝毫危险的预感；若有人说尤-冯比斯废墟中潜藏着威胁，我定会嗤之以鼻——在这不可理喻的骇人古迹中，连亡者的幽灵想必也早已消散于虚无。\n\n记忆中唯有标志着浅眠的漫长感尤为清晰。我忆起子夜时分在头顶呜咽的透骨寒风，以及掠过脸庞的沙粒——它们像细雹般从一片沙漠吹向另一片亘古沙漠。我还记得那些僵硬的星辰，在飞扬的远古尘埃中暂时黯淡的模样。风停后，我在半梦半醒间再度昏沉。最后朦胧意识到，双月福波斯与德莫斯已然升起，在废墟上投下幽灵般的巨大阴影，并为同伴们裹着尸布的身躯覆上灰白光晕。\n\n我必定处于半梦半醒间，因为所见景象的记忆如梦境般可疑。透过低垂的眼睑，我看见微小的月亮攀上无顶三角塔尖，投下的阴影几乎触及其他考古学家的身体。\n\n整个场景凝固在石化般的静默中，无人翻动。就在我即将闭眼时，冰封的幽暗中似有动静——最前端那片阴影的某部分仿佛自行剥离，正朝躺得离废墟最近的奥克塔夫蠕动。\n\n即便深陷昏沉，这反常景象仍令我警醒。我刚要起身，那阴影物体——无论为何——便倏然后退，重新融入更大的阴影中。它的消失使我彻底清醒，却又无法确定是否真实目睹过它。在最后惊鸿一瞥中，那像是块直径约十二至十四英寸的粗糙圆形布革，黑暗皱褶，如尺蠖般折叠行进。\n\n近一小时内我再未入眠。若非酷寒难耐，我定会起身查证这荒诞景象是否真实。我凝视着阴影消失的漆黑处，任由一连串怪诞猜想在脑海中翻腾。尽管略有不安，我仍未感到切实恐惧。渐渐地，我开始说服自己那不过是梦境幻象。最终，我再度陷入浅眠。\n\n贾尔风掠过锯齿状城墙的恶魔般叹息将我惊醒，只见苍白月光中已混入黎明曙光。我们哆嗦着用冻僵的手指借助酒精灯准备早餐。太阳如同杂耍球般跃出地平线时，废墟在稀薄晨光中如原始巨人的陵墓般森然矗立，毫无光影过渡，直面着濒死星球的最后黎明。\n\n（贾尔）\n\n夜间那诡异的视觉体验愈发显得虚幻，我只略加思索便未向同伴提及。但它或许如梦中扭曲的阴影般，为我的清醒时刻染上无名情绪——一种对非人化异域环境与废墟深不可测之古老的窒息感。这感觉仿佛源自伟大非人建筑中渗出的百万幽灵轮廓，它们如墓穴孵化的梦魇压迫着我，却无任何人类思维可理解的形式与意义。我仿佛不是在露天行进，而是被困在密封墓穴的窒闷幽暗中，被死亡气息与亘古腐败的瘴气所扼喉。\n\n同伴们热切渴望探索废墟，我自然无法提及这种看似荒谬的无端情绪。异星人类常因环境中的陌生力量与新异辐射而产生此类神经症状。但当我们初步勘察接近建筑时，一阵瘫痪性恐慌突然攫住我，令我瞬间无法动弹或呼吸。黑暗的冰冷粘腻感渗透脑髓与肌肉，连最深层的机能都为之凝滞。待它消退，我才得以继续跟随队伍。\n\n奇怪的是，两位火星人拒绝同行。他们沉默寡言，虽未明言缘由，但显然任何事物都无法驱使他们进入尤-冯比斯。我们无法判断他们是否畏惧废墟——那斜小眼睛与巨大鼻孔构成的谜样面容未泄露任何人类可理解的情绪。面对询问，他们仅表示艾海人已世代未踏足此地，显然此处存在某种神秘禁忌。\n\n初步勘察中，我们仅携带撬棍与两把鹤嘴锄。其余工具与高爆炸药留在营地备用。虽然有人配有手枪，但我们都认为废墟中不可能存在生命形态，故未携带。\n\n奥克塔夫在勘察中异常兴奋，不断发出惊叹。其余人则沉默压抑——我想许多人多少都分享了我的感受。这些巨石散发的阴森敬畏令人无法摆脱。\n\n我无暇详述废墟细节，必须加快叙述。事实上城市主要区域终将未被探索。我们在三角阶梯状建筑群中穿行许久，沿着与建筑风格匹配的锯齿形街道前进。多数塔楼已不同程度倾颓，风沙经年累月的侵蚀磨平了许多巨墙的棱角。通过高窄门廊进入某些塔楼后，唯见彻底的空洞。曾有的一切陈设必已化为尘埃，继而被沙漠狂风吹散。部分外墙上残留着雕刻或铭文痕迹，但岁月已将其磨损殆尽，我们仅能辨识出些无法解读的残缺轮廓。\n\n最终，我们来到一条宽阔的大道尽头，眼前耸立着一道绵延数百码、高约四十尺的巨型台地城墙，其上簇拥着如卫城般的核心建筑群。一段为比人类乃至现今细长火星人更为高大的生物所设计的残破阶梯，通向这座似乎直接从高原岩体开凿而成的平台。\n\n我们驻足商议，决定暂缓探查那些暴露在外、损毁尤为严重的高层建筑——它们多半徒劳无功。奥克塔夫正抱怨着未能发现任何能揭示约-冯比斯历史的器物或雕刻。就在这时，阶梯右侧的城墙处，我们注意到一处被古老瓦砾半掩的入口。\n\n拨开碎石堆后，一段向下的阶梯显现在眼前。黑暗如实质般从洞口倾泻而出，散发着原始腐朽的恶臭。手电光仅能照亮最初几级台阶，其后仿佛悬于漆黑深渊之上。我们携带的电筒此刻派上了用场——正如预料约-冯比斯可能存在如现代火星城市般庞大的地下墓穴，这些地窖最可能保存约尔希文明的遗迹。\n\n奥克塔夫将光束射向深渊，率先拾级而下，兴奋地呼唤我们跟上。刹那间，那种莫名恐惧再次冻结我的行动，直到荒诞感驱散战栗。我随他步入黑暗，众人紧随其后。\n\n阶梯尽头是条布满远古尘埃的长廊。灰色粗粉堆积处，疑似火星运河下真菌分解的残留——尽管极端干旱早该灭绝所有生命。这里空气凝滞如沉淀的古代大气，每一步都扬起带着木乃伊粉末般腐朽气息的细尘。\n\n长廊尽头的窄门前，手电照出一口四尺宽的浅盆，墨绿材质似金属与陶瓷的怪异合金，厚缘刻满扭曲难辨的酸蚀纹样。盆底黑色灰烬散发着微弱刺鼻气息，奥克塔夫俯身查看时被呛得连连咳嗽。\"这强效熏蒸剂，\"他推测，\"可能是约-冯比斯人用来净化地窖的。\"\n\n穿过门洞，更大的石室呈现眼前。相对洁净的地面用赭石矿料绘制着几何纹样，其间如埃及涡纹般环绕着象形文字与高度程式化的图案。多数难以辨识，但不少显然描绘着约尔希族——他们如艾海人般高大棱角，鼓风箱般的胸膛，却多出第三条从胸口伸出的手臂（此特征偶现于艾海人）。与现代火星人相比，他们的耳鼻并不那么宽大。所有形象皆裸体，唯有一处潦草涡纹中，两个头戴锥形缠头的身影正用四节手指做出诡异的调整头巾姿势。\n\n第二地窖延伸出蛛网般的通道。沿墙排列着齐人高的鼓腹瓮，与熏蒸盆同材质，角柄塞子需合力方能开启——里面盛满骨灰，证实约尔希族实行火星沿袭至今的家族合葬。前行中连奥克塔夫也陷入沉默，某种沉思的敬畏取代了早先兴奋。我们都被这超越认知的古老压得喘不过气，仿佛每一步都在深入时空深渊。\n\n阴影如畸形蝙蝠翅在前方扑动。直到最深处地窖，我们才在拱顶发现一块皱缩的暗色圆斑，似干枯菌类不可触及。当决定折返时，骨灰瓮长廊尽头竟是一面死墙。\n\n墙前直立着最惊人的发现：一具七尺高的木乃伊，沥青色躯体仅罩黑色头罩，三臂特征表明这是罕见的约尔希族遗存。细看才发觉它被锈蚀金属箍固定在墙上——踝、膝、腰、肩、颈五处束缚。那头罩覆着霉斑般的细绒，如陈年蛛网般污秽，却散发着难以名状的憎恶感。\n\n\"天哪！这可是个大发现！\"奥克塔夫惊呼道，将火把戳向那具木乃伊的面部。阴影在深陷的眼窝、巨大的三重鼻孔以及兜帽下向上翻卷的宽耳中蠕动，宛如活物。\n\n他仍高举火把，伸出空着的那只手轻轻触碰尸体。尽管动作小心翼翼，桶状躯干的下半部分、双腿、双手及前臂却都瞬间化作齑粉，只余头颅与上半身仍悬挂在金属镣铐中。腐朽的进程诡异而不均，残留部分竟毫无崩解迹象。\n\n奥克塔夫发出惊恐的喊叫，随即被腾空而起的褐色尘雾笼罩，开始剧烈咳嗽打喷嚏。我们其余人纷纷后退躲避。就在尘雾弥漫之际，我目睹了难以置信的一幕：木乃伊头上的黑色兜帽边缘开始向上卷曲抽搐，带着蛆虫般的蠕动从干枯颅骨滑落，坠落时在半空中痉挛般开合。它落在奥克塔夫裸露的头顶——他因木乃伊的粉碎而惊惶失措，仍紧贴墙壁站立。刹那间，深植骨髓的恐惧令我忆起曾在双月辉光下从约-冯比斯阴影中蠕行而出，又在我初醒时如梦境幻影般退却的那个东西。\n\n那物事如紧裹的布料般贴合，覆住奥克塔夫的头发、前额与双眼。他发出癫狂的尖叫，语无伦次地求救，手指疯狂撕扯兜帽却无法挣脱。惨叫声随即在痛苦中攀升至疯狂顶点，仿佛正遭受地狱刑具的折磨；他在墓室中盲目蹦跳，以诡异迅捷躲闪着我们的援手。整件事如噩梦般离奇，但落在他头上的显然是某种未被分类的火星生命体，违背所有已知科学定律存活在这原始地穴中。我们必须设法将他从魔爪中解救。\n\n我们试图围堵发狂的领队——在最后几座骨灰瓮与墙壁间的狭小空间里这本该易如反掌。但被蒙住双眼的他竟以加倍匪夷所思的方式绕开我们，冲向骨灰瓮群消失在外围交错的地穴迷宫中。\n\n\"上帝啊！他怎么了？\"哈珀喊道，\"这人像被附身了似的！\"\n\n显然无暇讨论这谜团，我们强压震惊全速追赶。黑暗中早已不见奥克塔夫踪影，直到最左侧地穴传来阵阵尖利惨叫。那叫声透着非人的诡异特质，或许源于凝滞空气或洞穴特殊的声学效应。但我总觉得这不似人类声带所能发出——至少不是活人。其中蕴含某种无魂的机械式痛苦，恍若被恶魔驱使的尸体所发出的哀嚎。\n\n我们擎着火把在成排巨瓮间狂奔。尖叫声已沉入坟茔般的寂静，唯余远处微弱的奔跑声。当我们因污浊空气喘息减速时，奥克塔夫的脚步声已如被坟墓吞噬的幽灵般遥不可闻。最终万籁俱寂，只剩我们痉挛的呼吸与太阳穴如警鼓般轰鸣的血流声。\n\n分队搜索数小时后，我们重返发现镣铐木乃伊的最终地穴。临近时听见有节奏的金属撞击声——此情此景下令人毛骨悚然。火把照亮了既难以解释又出乎意料的场景：一个人影背对我们站立，头部被沙发垫大小的肿胀黑物遮蔽，正用尖头金属棒猛击墙壁。奥克塔夫何时归来、从何处取得铁棒皆成谜团。但灰白墙壁已在暴烈敲击下剥落，露出与骨灰瓮同材质的窄门。\n\n我们惊愕僵立之际，奥克塔夫扔掉铁棒摸索墙上的机关。随着墓石板般厚重的门扉向内开启，地底午夜般的黑暗如埋葬万古的秽物洪流喷涌而出。刹那间我们的电筒光晕摇曳暗淡，所有人都被那股源自亘古腐臭世界的窒息恶臭笼罩。\n\n此刻奥克塔夫转身面对我们，在敞开的门前摆出任务完成的姿态。我率先挣脱麻痹，掏出折刀刺向包裹他整个头颅的黑色肿胀物。那东西形似无头无尾的巨蛞蝓，覆盖着我曾提及的霉状绒毛。刀刃如划破腐纸般撕开长口，恐怖生物如漏气皮囊般塌陷，喷出混杂毛发、胶状骨块与白色凝乳状碎片的血瀑。奥克塔夫随即踉跄倒地，在扬起的木乃伊尘雾中气绝身亡。\n\n强忍厌恶掰开那瘫软渗流的可怖生物时，我宁愿自己从未动手。其下早已没有人类颅骨——直至眉骨皆被啃噬殆尽，掀开兜帽状物体时暴露出半消化的脑组织。当我失手掉落这不可名状之物时，它翻转露出底部排列成环的粉红吸盘，围绕覆盖神经状丝线的苍白圆盘。\n\n\"他死了多久？\"哈尔格伦的低语道出我们共同的恐惧。无人应答，唯有凝视奥克塔夫的尸体。\n\n当我机械地移开视线，首次注意到镣铐木乃伊干枯头颅上的啃噬痕迹。随后目光被新开启的门洞吸引——火把照亮深处坑穴中无数蠕虫般扭动的阴影。它们如沸腾的黑潮涌出地渊，正是我曾从奥克塔夫颅骨扯下的恶魔水蛭同类。有些薄如布帛，有些鼓胀迟缓。天知道它们在永恒密封的黑暗中以何为食——而我祈祷永远不必知晓。\n\n我触电般后退，看着这支黑色大军以梦魇速度漫过门槛。它们如地狱饱食后的秽物洪流袭来，在奥克塔夫尸体上翻涌成浪。这时我惊恐地发现，先前丢弃的那团死物竟开始挣扎翻身，企图加入同类大军。\n\n然而我与同伴们皆无法忍受这骇人的景象。我们转身狂奔于巍峨的骨灰瓮阵列之间，那群滑腻的恶魔水蛭紧追不舍。当抵达地窖第一处分岔口时，众人便在盲目恐慌中四散奔逃。我们不顾彼此，只凭着逃命的冲动胡乱钻进枝蔓横生的甬道。身后传来有人踉跄倒地的咒骂声，随即化作癫狂的尖叫——但我深知若回头施救，只会招致与队尾落难者相同的厄运。\n\n我紧攥着电筒与展开的折刀，沿一条次要通道奔逃。记忆中这条路本应较为直接地通向那座绘有地画的外层大厅，此刻却发现自己孤身一人。同伴们仍留在主干墓道中，远处传来沉闷的疯叫，仿佛已有数人遭追猎者捕获。\n\n这条甬道的走向显然与记忆相悖。它诡谲地蜿蜒转折，布满陌生岔路，我很快便迷失在这座黑色迷宫里。此处尘埃堆积，经年累月无人惊扰。骨灰瓮群再度陷入死寂，唯有我自己的喘息声如泰坦巨人般响彻幽冥。\n\n突然，电筒光晕中浮现出人影。未及定神，那身影已迈着机械般的大步掠过我身侧，似要重返地窖深处。从体型判断应是哈珀，但无法确定——其双眼以上被某种膨胀的黑色头罩遮蔽，惨白的嘴唇紧闭如遭受强直性折磨的死者。他遗落了电筒，却在那股非人吸血的驱使下，于绝对黑暗中盲目奔向恐怖源头。我明白他已无药可救，更无阻拦之念。\n\n战栗间继续奔逃，又有两名同伴如提线木偶般经过。他们戴着那种附魔水蛭制成的头罩，其余人想必已从主道折返——我再未遇见他们，亦永无相见之日。\n\n余下的逃亡沦为癫狂的混沌。当再次以为接近出口时，却闯入排列着巨型骨灰瓮的陌生墓室。这些地窖显然远超我们探索范围，延伸至不可知处。仿佛奔跑了数年之久，当肺部几乎被陈腐空气灼穿、双腿即将崩溃时，远方终于浮现针尖大的天光。我冲向那救赎之光，身后簇拥着异界黑暗的恐怖，眼前掠过不祥暗影，最终来到一处坍塌的低矮入口，碎石堆上洒落着稀薄阳光。\n\n这并非我们进入死亡地界的原路。距出口十余英尺时，某物毫无征兆地从穹顶坠下，如收紧的罗网般裹住头颅。霎时间百万根毒针般的剧痛穿透颅骨，汇聚成持续增长的酷刑，直抵脑髓深处。\n\n这一刻的恐惧与痛苦远超人间疯癫所能企及。我感受到某种比死亡更可怖的吸血存在正施以暴虐的攫取。\n\n电筒应已脱手，但右手仍紧握折刀。在近乎无意识的状态下，我本能地挥刀向头上缠绕的致命物体乱斩。刀刃必然多次贯穿那黏附的怪物，同时在我脸上划出无数伤口——但在压倒性的剧痛中，这些创伤已无足轻重。\n\n终于重见天光时，发现一条黑色带状物正从眉骨垂下，浸透鲜血贴附面颊。它犹自蠕动，被我连带着其他残留碎片从头上撕下。踉跄冲向洞口时，苍白光线在我眼前化作摇曳远去的火焰——当我跌出洞穴那刻，这火焰如创世最后一颗星辰，消逝于我正在坠入的混沌虚空中……\n\n据说我昏迷不久。苏醒时只见两位火星向导俯身凝视。头颅如遭万箭穿刺，朦胧恐惧如鹰身女妖的阴影笼罩心神。转头回望洞穴——火星人发现我后已将我从洞口拖出段距离。那开口位于阶梯状建筑外墙下，与我们营地遥遥相望。\n\n我魔怔般盯着漆黑洞口，隐约瞥见阴影蠕动：无数秽物在黑暗中翻涌却畏缩于光明。这些超自然黑夜的造物，这些轮回封闭的腐化产物，终究无法忍受阳光。\n\n此时终极恐怖攫住了我。在翻涌的恶心与逃离冲动中，竟升起一股矛盾的强烈欲望：要像同伴们那样重返墓道；要前往那些注定受诅咒者才踏足的深渊；要在邪恶驱使下探寻人类思维无法描绘的地下世界。我脑中有道幽暗光芒在无声召唤，如同渗透骨髓的巫毒，引诱我走向约-冯比斯垂死先民封堵的地底之门——那里囚禁着永生的地狱水蛭，那些将可憎生命嫁接于死者残脑的黑暗寄生虫。更深处还蛰伏着秽恶的通灵存在，水蛭不过是它们麾下最卑微的爪牙……\n\n若非两位埃海人阻拦，我早已折返。我疯狂挣扎对抗他们海绵质的手臂，但终日非人遭遇已耗尽体力。不久再度坠入虚无，仅间歇性浮出意识，模糊感知正被抬往伊格纳尔荒漠。\n\n至此故事终了。我趁神智尚存时竭力完整叙述，代价远非常人所能想象……趁下次癫狂发作前——它很快会来，现在已初现端倪……是的，我已讲述完毕……你都记录下来了，对吧？现在我必须回到约-冯比斯……穿越荒漠，穿过所有墓道，前往更深处的地窖。有东西在我脑中发号施令……我必须前往……"

        "content": "\n\nSWELLING AND TOWERING swiftly, like a genie loosed from one of Solomon’s bottles, the cloud rose on the planet’s rim. A rusty and colossal column, it strode above the dead plain, through a sky that was dark as the brine of desert seas that have ebbed down to desert pools.\n\nS\n\nWELLING\n\nAND\n\nTOWERING\n\n“Looks like a blithering sandstorm,” commented Maspic.\n\n“It can’t very well be anything else,” agreed Bellman rather curtly. “Any other kind of storm is unheard of in these regions. It’s the sort of hell-twister that the Aihais call the zoorth — and it’s coming our way, too. I move that we start looking for shelter. I’ve been caught in the zoorth before, and I don’t recommend a lungful of that ferruginous dust.”\n\nzoorth\n\n“There’s a cave in the old river bank, to the right,” said Chivers, the third member of the party, who had been searching the desert with restless, falconlike eyes.\n\nThe trio of earthmen, hard-bitten adventurers who disdained the services of Martian guides, had started five days before from the outpost of Ahoom, into the uninhabited region called the Chaur. Here, in the beds of great rivers that had not flowed for cycles, it was rumored that the pale, platinum-like gold of Mars could be found lying in heaps, like so much salt. If fortune were propitious, their years of somewhat unwilling exile on the red planet would soon be at an end. They had been warned against the Chaur, and had heard some queer tales in Ahoom regarding the reasons why former prospectors had not returned. But danger, no matter how dire or exotic, was merely a part of their daily routine. With a fair chance of unlimited gold at the journey’s end they would have gone down through Hinnom.\n\nTheir food-supplies and water-barrels were carried on the backs of three of those curious mammals called vortlups, which, with their elongated legs and necks, and horny-plated bodies, might seemingly have been some fabulous combination of llama and saurian. These animals, though extravagantly ugly, were tame and obedient, and were well adapted to desert travel, being able to go without water for months at a time.\n\nvortlups,\n\nFor the past two days they had followed the mile-wide course of a nameless ancient river, winding among hills that had dwindled to mere hummocks through aeons of exfoliation. They had found nothing but worn boulders, pebbles and fine rusty sand. Heretofore the sky had been silent and stirless; and nothing moved on the river-bottom, whose stones were bare even of dead lichen. The malignant column of the zoorth, twisting and swelling toward them, was the first sign of animation they had discerned in that lifeless land.\n\nzoorth,\n\nProdding their vortlups with the iron-pointed goads which alone could elicit any increase of speed from these sluggish monsters, the earthmen started off toward the cavern-mouth descried by Chivers. It was perhaps a third of a mile distant, and was high up in the shelving shore.\n\nvortlups\n\nThe zoorth had blotted out the sun ere they reached the bottom of the ancient slope, and they moved through a sinister twilight that was colored like dried blood. The vortlups, protesting with unearthly bellows, began to climb the beach, which was marked off in a series of more or less regular steps that indicated the slow recession of its olden waters. The column of sand, rising and whirling formidably, had reached the opposite bank when they came to the cavern.\n\nThis cavern was in the face of a low cliff of iron-veined rock. The entrance had crumbled down in heaps of ferro-oxide and dark basaltic dust, but was large enough to admit with ease the earthmen and their laden beasts of burden. Darkness, heavy as if with a weaving of black webs, clogged the interior. They could form no idea of the cave’s dimensions till Bellman got out an electric torch from his bale of belongings and turned its prying beam into the shadows.\n\nThe torch served merely to reveal the beginnings of a chamber of indeterminate size that ran backward into night, widening gradually, with a floor that was worn smooth as if by vanished waters.\n\nThe opening had grown dark with the onset of the zoorth. A weird moaning as of baffled demons filled the ears of the explorers, and particles of atomlike sand were blown in upon them, stinging their hands and faces like powdered adamant.\n\nzoorth.\n\n“The storm will last for half an hour, at least,” said Bellman. “Shall we go on into the cave? Probably we won’t find anything of much interest or value. But the exploration will serve to kill time. And we might happen on a few violet rubies or amber-yellow sapphires, such as are sometimes discovered in these desert caverns. You two had better bring along your torches also, and flash them on the walls and ground as we go.”\n\nHis companions thought the suggestion worth following. The vortlups, wholly insensible to the blowing sand in their scaly mail, were left behind near the entrance. Chivers, Bellman and Maspic, with their torch-beams tearing a clotted gloom that had perhaps never known the intrusion of light in all its former cycles, went on into the widening cave.\n\nThe place was bare, with the death-like emptiness of some long-deserted catacomb. Its rusted floor and walls returned no gleam or sparkle to the playing lights. It sloped downward at an easy gradient and the sides were water-marked at a height of six or seven feet. No doubt it had been in earlier aeons the channel of an underground offshoot from the river. It had been swept clean of all detritus, and was like the interior of some Cyclopean conduit that might give upon a sub-Martian Erebus.\n\nNone of the three adventurers was overly imaginative or prone to nervousness. But all were beset by certain odd impressions. Behind the arras of cryptic silence, time and again they seemed to hear a faint whisper, like the sigh of sunken seas far down at some hemispheric depth. The air was tinged with a slight and doubtful dankness, and they felt the stirring of an almost imperceptible draft upon their faces. Oddest of all was the hint of a nameless odor, reminding them both of animal dens and the peculiar smell of Martian dwellings.\n\n“Do you suppose well encounter any kind of life?” said Maspic, sniffing the air dubiously.\n\n“Not likely.” Bellman dismissed the query with his usual curtness. “Even the wild vortlups avoid the Chaur.”\n\n“But there’s certainly a touch of dampness in the air,” persisted Maspic. “That means water, somewhere; and if there is water, there may be life also — perhaps of a dangerous kind.”\n\n“We’ve got our revolvers,” said Bellman. “But I doubt if we’ll need them — as long as we don’t meet any rival gold-hunters from the Earth,” he added cynically.\n\n“Listen.” The semi-whisper came from Chivers. “Do you fellows hear anything?”\n\nAll three had paused. Somewhere in the gloom ahead, they heard a prolonged, equivocal noise that baffled the ear with incongruous elements. It was a sharp rustling and rattling as of metal dragged over rock, and also it was somehow like the smacking of myriad wet, enormous mouths. Anon it receded and died out at a level that was seemingly far below.\n\n“That’s queer.” Bellman seemed to make a reluctant admission.\n\n“What is it?” queried Chivers. “One of the millipedal underground monsters, half a mile long, that the Martians tell about?”\n\n“You’ve been hearing too many native fairy-tales,” reproved Bellman. “No terrestrial has ever seen anything of that kind. Many deep-lying caverns on Mars have been thoroughly explored: but those in desert regions, such as the Chaur, were devoid of life. I can’t imagine what could have made that noise; but, in the interests of science, I’d like to go on and find out.”\n\n“I’m beginning to feel creepy,” said Maspic. “But I’m game if you others are.”\n\nWithout further argument or comment, the three continued their advance into the cave. They had been walking at a fair gait for fifteen minutes, and were now at least half a mile from the entrance. The floor was steepening as if it had been the bed of a torrent. Also, the conformation of the walls had changed: on either hand there were high shelves of metallic stone and columnated recesses which the flashed rays of the torches could not always fathom.\n\nThe air had grown heavier, the dampness unmistakable. There was a breath of stagnant ancient waters. That other smell, as of wild beasts and Aihai dwellings, also tainted the gloom with its clinging fetor.\n\nBellman was leading the way. Suddenly his torch revealed the verge of a precipice, where the olden channel ended sheerly and the shelves and walls pitched away on each side into incalculable space. Going to the very edge, he dipped his pencil of light adown the abyss, disclosing only the vertical cliff that fell at his feet into darkness with no apparent bottom. The beam also failed to reach the further shore of the gulf, which might have been many leagues in extent.\n\n“Looks as if we had found the original jumping-off place,” observed Chivers. Looking about, he secured a loose lump of rock the size of a small boulder, which he hurled as far out as he could into the abysm. The earthmen listened for the sound of its fall; but several minutes went by, and there was no echo from the black profound.\n\nBellman started to examine the broken-off ledges on either side of the channel’s terminus. To the right he discerned a downward-sloping shelf that skirted the abyss, running for an uncertain distance. Its beginning was little higher than the channel-fed, and was readily accessible by means of a stair-like formation, The shelf was two yards wide and its gentle inclination, its remarkable evenness and regularity conveyed the idea of an ancient road hewn in the face of the cliff. It was overhung by the wall, as if by the sharply sundered half of a high arcade.\n\n“There’s our road to Hades,” said Bellman. “And the downgrade is easy enough at that.”\n\n“What’s the use of going further?” said Maspic. “I, for one, have had enough darkness already. And if we were to find anything by going on, it would be valueless — or unpleasant.”\n\nBellman hesitated. “Maybe you’re right. But I’d like to follow that ledge far enough to get some idea of the magnitude of the gulf. You and Chivers can wait here, if you’re afraid.”\n\nChivers and Maspic, apparently, were unwilling to avow whatever trepidation they might have felt. They followed Bellman along the shelf, hugging the inner wall. Bellman, however, strode carelessly on the verge, often flashing his torch into the vastitude that engulfed its feeble beam.\n\nMore and more, through its uniform breadth, inclination and smoothness, and the demi-arch of cliff above, the shelf impressed the earthmen as being an artificial road But who could have made and used it? In what forgotten ages and for what enigmatic purpose had it been designed? The imagination of the terrestrials failed before the stupendous gulfs of Martian antiquity that yawned in such tenebrous queries.\n\nBellman thought that the wall curved inward upon itself by slow degrees. No doubt they would round the entire abyss in time by following the road. Perhaps it wound in a slow, tremendous spiral, ever downward, about and about, to the very bowels of Mars.\n\nHe and the others were awed into lengthening intervals of silence. They were horribly startled, when, as they went on, they heard in the depths beneath the same peculiar long-drawn sound or combination of sounds which they had heard in the outer cavern. It suggested other images now: the rustling was a file-like scraping; the soft, methodical, myriad smacking was vaguely similar to the noise made by some enormous creature that withdraws its feet from a quagmire.\n\nThe sound was inexplicable, terrifying. Part of its terror lay in an implication of remoteness, which appeared to signalize the enormity of its cause, and to emphasize the profundity of the abysm. Heard in that planetary pit beneath a lifeless desert it astonished — and shocked. Even Bellman, intrepid heretofore, began to succumb to the formless horror that rose up like an emanation from the night.\n\nremoteness,\n\nThe noise grew fainter and ceased at length, giving somehow the idea that its maker had gone directly down on the perpendicular wall into nether reaches of the gulf.\n\n“Shall we go back?” inquired Chivers.\n\n“We might as well ,” assented Bellman without demur. “It would take all eternity to explore this place anyway.”\n\nThey started to retrace their way along the ledge. All three, with that extra-tactile sense which warns of the approach of hidden danger, were now troubled and alert. Though the gulf had grown silent once more with that withdrawal of the strange noise, they somehow felt that they were not alone. Whence the peril would come, or in what shape, they could not surmise; but they felt an alarm that was almost panic. Tacitly, none of them mentioned it; nor did they discuss the eerie mystery on which they had stumbled in a manner so fortuitous.\n\nMaspic was a little ahead of the others now. They had covered at least half of the distance to the old cavern-channel, when his torch, playing for twenty feet ahead on the path, illumined an array of whitish figures, three abreast, that blocked the way. The flashlights of Bellman and Chivers, coming close behind, brought out with hideous clearness the vanward limbs and faces of the throng, but could not determine its number.\n\nThe creatures, who stood perfectly motionless and silent, as if awaiting the earthmen, were generically similar to the Aihais or Martian natives. They seemed however, to represent an extremely degraded and aberrant type, and the fungus-like pallor of their bodies denoted many ages of underground life. They were smaller too, than full-grown Aihais, being, on the average, about five feet tall. They possessed the enormous open nostrils. the flaring ears, the barrel chests and lanky limbs of the Martians — but all of them were eyeless. In the faces of some, there were faint, rudimentary slits where the eyes should have been; in the faces of others, there were deep and empty orbits that suggested a removal of the eyeballs.\n\n“Lord! what a ghastly crew!” cried Maspic. “Where do they come from? and what do they want?”\n\n“Can’t imagine,” said Bellman. “But our situation is somewhat ticklish — unless they are friendly. They must have been hiding on the shelves in the cavern above when we entered.”\n\nStepping boldly forward, ahead of Maspic, he addressed the creatures in the guttural Aihai tongue, many of whose vocables are scarcely to be articulated by an earthman. Some of the people stirred uneasily, and emitted shrill, cheeping sounds that bore little likeness to the Martian language. It was plain that they could not understand Bellman. Sign-language, by reason of their blindness, would have been equally useless.\n\nBellman drew his revolver, enjoining the others to follow suit. “We’ve got to get through them somehow,” he said “And if they won’t let us pass without interference—” the click of a cocked hammer served to finish the sentence.\n\nAs if the metallic sound had been an awaited signal the press of blind white beings sprang into sudden motion and surged forward upon the terrestrials. It was like the onset of automatons — an irresistible striding of machines, concerted and methodical, beneath the direction of a hidden power.\n\nBellman pulled his trigger, once, twice, thrice, at a point-blank range. It was impossible to miss; but the bullets were futile as pebbles flung at the spate of an onrushing torrent. The eyeless beings did not waver, though two of them began to bleed the yellowish-red fluid that serves the Martians for blood. The foremost of them, unwounded, and moving with diabolical sureness, caught Bellman’s arm with long, four-jointed fingers, and jerked the revolver from his grasp before he could press the trigger again. Curiously enough. the creature did not try to deprive him of his torch, which he now carried in his left hand; and he saw the steely flash of the Colt, as it hurtled down into darkness and space from the hand of the Martian. Then the fungus-white bodies, milling horribly on the narrow road, were all about him, pressing so closely that there was no room for effectual resistance.\n\nChivers and Maspic, after firing a few shots, were also deprived of their weapons, but, through an uncanny discrimination, were permitted to retain their flashlights.\n\nThe entire episode had been a matter of moments. There was only a brief slackening of the onward motion of the throng, two of whose members had been shot down by Chivers and Maspic and then hurled expeditiously into the gulf by their fellows. The foremost ranks, opening deftly, included the earthmen and forced them to turn backward. Then, tightly caught in a moving vice of bodies, they were borne resistlessly along. Handicapped by the fear of dropping their torches, they could do nothing against the nightmare torrent. Rushing with dreadful strides on a path that led ever deeper into the abyss, and able to see only the lit backs and members of the creatures before them, they became a part of that eyeless and cryptic army.\n\nBehind them, there seemed to be scores of the Martians, driving them on implacably. After awhile, their plight began to paralyze their faculties. It seemed that they moved no longer with human steps, but with the swift and automatic stalking of the clammy things that pressed about them. Thought, volition, even terror, were numbed by the unearthly rhythm of those abyssward-beating feet. Constrained by this, and by a sense of utter unreality, they spoke only at long intervals, and then in monosyllables that appeared to have lost all proper meaning, like the speech of machines. The blind people were wholly silent — there was no sound, except that of a myriad, eternal padding on the stone.\n\nOn, on they went, through ebon hours that belonged to no diurnal period. Slowly, tortuously, the road curved inward, as if it were coiled about the interior of a blind and cosmic Babel. The earthmen felt that they must have circled the abyss many times in that terrific spiral; but the distance they had gone, and the actual extent of the stupefying gulf, were inconceivable.\n\nExcept for their torches, the night was absolute, unchangeable. It was older than the sun, it had brooded there through all past aeons. It accumulated above them like a monstrous burden; it yawned frightfully beneath. From it, the strengthening stench of stagnant waters rose. But still there was no sound other than the soft and measured thud of marching feet that descended into a bottomless Abaddon.\n\nSomewhere, as if after the lapse of nocturnal ages, the pitward rushing had ceased. Bellman, Chivers and Maspic felt the pressure of crowded bodies relax; felt that they were standing still, while their brains continued to beat the unhuman measure of that terrible descent\n\nReason — and horror — returned to them slowly. Bellman lifted his flashlight, and the circling ray recovered the throng of Martians, many of whom were dispersing in a huge cavern where the gulf-circling road had now ended. Others of the beings remained, however, as if to keep guard over the earthmen. They quivered alertly at Bellman’s movements as if aware of them through an unknown sense.\n\nClose at hand, on the right, the level floor ended abruptly, and stepping to the verge, Bellman saw that the cavern was an open chamber in the perpendicular wall. Far, far below in the blackness, a phosphorescent glimmer played to and fro, like noctilucae on an underworld ocean. A slow, fetid wind blew upon him; and he heard the weird sighing of waters about the sunken cliffs: waters that had ebbed through untold cycles, during the planet’s dessication.\n\nHe turned giddily away. His companions were examining the cave’s interior. It seemed that the place was of artificial origin; for, darting here and there, the torch-beams brought out enormous columnations lined with deeply graven bas-reliefs. Who had carved them or when, were problems no less insoluble than the origin of the cliff-hewn road. Their details were obscene as the visions of madness, they shocked the eye like a violent blow, conveying an extra-human evil, a bottomless malignity, in the passing moment of disclosure.\n\nThe cave was indeed of stupendous extent, running far back in the cliff, and with numerous exits, giving, no doubt, on further ramifications. The beams of the flashlights half dislodged the flapping shadows of shelved recesses; caught the salients of far walls that climbed and beetled into inaccessible gloom; played on the creatures that went to and fro like monstrous living fungi; gave to a brief visual existence the pale and polyp-like plants that clung noisomely to the nighted stone.\n\nThe place was overpowering, it oppressed the senses, crushed the brain. The very stone was like an embodiment of darkness; and light and vision were ephemeral intruders in this demesne of the blind. Somehow, the earthmen were weighed down by a conviction that escape was impossible. A strange lethargy claimed them. They did not even discuss their situation, but stood listless and silent.\n\nAnon, from the filthy gloom, a number of the Martians reappeared. With the same suggestion of controlled automatism that had marked all their actions, they gathered about the men once more, and urged them into the yawning cavern.\n\nStep by step, the three were borne along in that weird and leprous procession. The obscene columns multiplied, the cave deepened before them with endless vistas, like a revelation of foul things that drowse at the nadir of night. Faintly at first, but more strongly as they went on, there came to them an insidious feeling of somnolence, such as might have been caused by mephitical effluvia. They rebelled against it, for the drowsiness was somehow dark and evil. It grew heavier upon them — and then they came to the core of the horror.\n\nBetween the thick and seemingly topless pillars, the floor ascended in an altar of seven oblique and pyramidal tiers. On the top, there squatted an image of pale metal: a thing no larger than a hare, but monstrous beyond all imagining.\n\nThe Martians crowded about the earthmen. One of them took Bellman by the arm, as if urging him to climb the altar. With the slow steps of a dreamer, he mounted the sloping tiers, and Chivers and Maspic followed.\n\nThe image resembled nothing they had ever seen on the red planet — or elsewhere. It was carven of whitish gold, and it represented a humped animal with a smooth and overhanging carapace from beneath which its head and members issued in tortoise fashion. The head was venomously flat, triangular — and eyeless. From the drooping corners of the cruelly slitted mouth, two long proboscides curved upward, hollow and cuplike at the ends. The thing was furnished with a series of short legs, issuing at uniform intervals from under the carapace, and a curious double tail was coiled and braided beneath its crouching body. The feet were round, and had the shape of small, inverted goblets.\n\nUnclean and bestial as a figment of some atavistic madness, the eidolon seemed to drowse on the altar. It troubled the mind with a slow, insidious horror, it assailed the senses with an emanating stupor, an effluence as of primal worlds before the creation of light, where life might teem and raven slothfully in the blind ooze.\n\nDimly the earthmen saw that the altar swarmed with the blind Martians, who were crowding past them about the image. As if in some fantastic ritual of touch, these creatures were fondling the eidolon with their lank fingers, were tracing its loathsome outlines. Upon their brutal faces a narcotic ecstasy was imprinted. Compelled like sleepers in some abhorrent dream, Bellman, Chivers and Maspic followed their example.\n\nThe thing was cold to the touch, and clammy as if it had lain recently in a bed of slime. But it seemed to live, to throb and swell under their finger-tips. From it, in heavy, ceaseless waves, a dark vibration surged: an opiate power that clouded the eyes; that poured its baleful slumber into the blood.\n\nWith senses that swam in a strange darkness, they were vaguely aware of the pressure of thronging bodies that displaced them at the altar-summit. Anon, certain of these, recoiling as if satiate with the drug-like effluence, bore them along the oblique tiers to the cavern-floor. Still retaining their torches in nerveless fingers, they saw that the place teemed with the white people, who had gathered for that unholy ceremony. Through blackening blurs of shadow, the men watched them as they seethed up and down on the pyramid like a leprous, living frieze.\n\nChivers and Maspic, yielding first to the influence, slid to the floor in utter sopor. But Bellman, more resistant, seemed to fall and drift through a world of lightless dreams. His sensations were anomalous, unfamiliar to the last degree. Everywhere there was a brooding, palpable Power for which he could find no visual image: a Power that exhaled a miasmal slumber. In those dreams, by insensible graduations, forgetting the last glimmer of his human self, he somehow identified himself with the eyeless people; he lived and moved as they, in profound caverns, on nighted roads. And yet he was something else: an Entity without name that ruled over the blind and was worshipped by them; a thing that dwelt in the ancient putrescent waters, in the nether deep, and came forth at intervals to raven unspeakably. In that duality of being, he sated himself at blind feasts — and was also devoured. With all this, like a third element of identity, the eidolon was associated: but only a tactile sense, and not as an optic memory. There was no light anywhere — and not even the recollection of light.\n\npalpable\n\nWhether he passed from these obscure nightmares into dreamless slumber, he could not know. His awakening, dark and lethargic, was like a continuation of the dreams at first. Then, opening his sodden lids, he saw the shaft of fight that lay on the floor front his fallen torch. The light poured against something that he could not recognize in his drugged awareness. Yet it troubled him, and a dawning horror touched his faculties into life.\n\nBy degrees, it came to him that the thing he saw was the half-eaten body of one of the eyeless troglodytes. Some of the members were missing; and the remainder was gnawed even to the curiously articulated bones.\n\nBellman rose unsteadily and looked about with eyes that still held a web-like blurring of shadow. Chivers and Maspic lay beside him in heavy stupor; and along the cavern and upon the seven-tiered altar were sprawled the devotees of the somnific image.\n\nHis other senses began to awake from their lethargy, and he thought that he heard a noise that was somehow familiar: a sharp slithering, together with a measured sucking. The sound withdrew among the massy pillars, beyond the sleeping bodies. A smell as of rotten water tinged the air, and he saw that there were many curious rings of wetness on the stone, such as might be made by the rims of inverted cups. Preserving the order of footprints, they led away from the half-devoured Martian, into the shadows of that outer cave which verged upon the abyss; the direction in which the queer noise had passed, sinking now to inaudibility.\n\nIn Bellman’s mind a mad terror rose and struggled with the spell that still benumbed him. He stooped down above Maspic and Chivers, and shook them roughly in turn, till they opened their eyes and began to protest with drowsy murmurs.\n\n“Get up, damn you,” he admonished them. “If we’re ever to escape from this hell-hole, now’s the time.”\n\nBy dint of many oaths and objurgations and much muscular effort, he succeeded in getting his companions to their feet. Lurching drunkenly, they followed Bellman among the sprawled Martians, away from the pyramid on which the eidolon of white gold still brooded in malign somnolence above its worshippers.\n\nA clouding heaviness hung upon Bellman; but somehow there was a relaxation of the opiate spell. He felt a revival of volition and a great desire to escape from the gulf and from all that dwelt in its darkness. The others, more deeply enslaved by the drowsy power, accepted his leadership and guidance in a numb, brute-like fashion.\n\nHe felt sure that he could retrace the route by which they had approached the altar. This, it seemed, was also the course that had been taken by the maker of the ring-like marks of fetid wetness. Wandering on amid the repugnantly carven columns for what seemed an enormous distance, they came at last to the sheer verge, that portice of the black Tartarus, from which they could look down on its ultimate gulf. Far beneath, on those putrefying waters, the phosphorescence ran in widening circles, as if troubled by the plunge of a heavy body. To the very edge, at their feet, the watery rings were imprinted on the rock.\n\nThey turned away, Bellman, shuddering with half-memories of his blind dreams, and the terror of his awakening, found at the cave’s corner the beginning of that upward road which skirted the abyss: the road that would take them back to the lost sun.\n\nAt his injunction, Maspic and Chivers turned off their flashlights to conserve the batteries. It was doubtful how much longer these would last and light was their prime necessity. His own torch would serve for the three till it became exhausted.\n\nThere was no sound or stirring of life from that cave of lightless sleep where the Martians lay about the narcotizing image. But a fear such as he had never felt in all his adventurings caused Bellman to sicken and turn faint as he listened at its threshold.\n\nThe gulf, too, was silent; and the circles of phosphor had ceased to widen on the waters. Yet somehow the silence was a thing that clogged the senses, retarded the limbs. It rose up around Bellman like the clutching slime of some nethermost pit, in which he must drown. With dragging effort he began the ascent, hauling, cursing and kicking his companions till they responded like drowsy animals.\n\nIt was a climb through Limbo, an ascent from nadir through darkness that seemed palpable and viscid. On and up they toiled, along the monotonous, imperceptibly winding grade where all measure of distance was lost, and time was meted only by the repetition of eternal steps. The night lowered before Bellman’s feeble shaft of light; it closed behind like an all-engulfing sea, relentless and patient; biding its time till the torch should go out.\n\nLooking over the verge at intervals, Bellman saw the gradual fading of the phosphorescence in the depths. Fantastic images rose in his mind, it was like the last glimmering of hell-fire in some extinct inferno; like the drowning of nebulae in voids beneath the universe. He felt the giddiness of one who looks down upon infinite space... Anon there was only blackness; and he knew by this token the awful distance they had climbed.\n\nThe minor urges of hunger, thirst, fatigue, had been trod under by the fear that impelled him. From Maspic and Chivers, very slowly, the clogging stupor lifted, and they too were conscious of an adumbration of terror vast as the night itself. The blows and kicks and objurgations of Bellman were no longer needed to drive them on.\n\nEvil, ancient, soporous, the night hung about them. It was like the thick and fetid fur of bats: a material thing that choked the lungs, that deadened all the senses. It was silent as the slumber of dead worlds... But out of that silence, after the lapse of apparent years, a twofold and familiar sound arose and overtook the fugitives: the sound of something that slithered over stone far down in the abyss: the sucking noise of a creature that withdrew its feet as if from a quagmire. Inexplicable, and arousing mad, incongruous ideas, like a sound heard in delirium, it quickened the earthmen’s terror into sudden frenzy,\n\n“God! what is it?” breathed Bellman. He seemed to remember sightless things, abhorrent, palpable shapes of primal night, that were no legitimate part of human recollection. His dreams and his nightmare awakening in the cave — the white eidolon — the half-eaten troglodyte of the nether cliffs — the rings of wetness, leading toward the gulf — all returned like the figments of a teeming madness, all to assail him on that terrible road midway between the underworld sea and the surface of Mars.\n\nHis question was answered only by a continuation of the noise. It seemed to grow louder — to ascend the wall beneath. Maspic and Chivers, snapping on their lights, began to run with frantic leaps; and Bellman, losing his last remnant of control, followed suit.\n\nIt was a race with unknown horror. Above the labored beating of their hearts, the measured thudding of their feet, the men still heard that sinister, unaccountable sound. They seemed to race on through leagues of blackness; and yet the noise drew nearer, climbing below them, as if its maker were a thing that walked on the sheer cliff.\n\nNow the sound was appallingly close — and a little ahead. It ceased abruptly. The running lights of Maspic and Chivers, who moved abreast, discovered the crouching thing that filled the two-yard shelf from side to side.\n\nHardened adventurers though they were the men would have shrieked aloud with hysteria, or would have hurled themselves from the precipice, if the sight had not induced a kind of catalepsy. It was as if the pale idol of the pyramid, swollen to mammoth proportions, and loathsomely alive, had come up from the abyss and was squatting before them!\n\nalive,\n\nHere, plainly, was the creature that had served as a model for that atrocious image. The humped, enormous carapace, vaguely recalling the armor of the glyptodon, shone with a luster as of wet white gold. The eyeless head, alert but sonmolent, was thrust forward on a neck that arched obscenely. A dozen or more of short legs, with goblet-shapen feet, protruded slantwise beneath the overhanging shell. The two proboscides, yard-long, with cupped ends, arose from the corners of the cruelly slitted mouth and waved slowly in air toward the earthmen.\n\nThe thing, it seemed, was old as that dying planet, an unknown form of primal life that had dwelt always in the caverned waters. Before it, the faculties of the earthmen were drugged by an evil stupor, such as they had felt before the eidolon. They stood with their flashlights playing full on the Terror; and they could not move nor cry out when it reared suddenly erect, revealing its ridged belly and the queer double tail that slithered and rustled metallically on the rock. Its numerous feet, beheld in this posture, were hollow and chalice-like, and they oozed with mephitic wetness. No doubt they served for suction-pads, enabling it to walk on a perpendicular surface.\n\nInconceivably swift and sure in all its motions, with short strides on its hindmost legs, levered by the tail, the monster came forward on the helpless men. Unerringly the two proboscides curved over, and their ends came down on Chivers’ eyes as he stood with lifted face. They rested there, covering the entire sockets — for a moment only. Then there was an agonizing scream, as the hollow tips were withdrawn with a sweeping movement lithe and vigorous as the lashing of serpents.\n\nChivers swayed slowly, nodding his head, and twisting about in half-narcotised pain. Maspic, standing at his side, saw in a dull and dream-like manner the gaping orbits from which the eyes were gone. It was the last thing that he ever saw. At that instant the monster turned from Chivers, and the terrible cups dripping with blood and fetor, descended on Maspic’s own eyes.\n\nBellman, who had paused close behind the others, comprehended what was occurring like one who witnesses the abominations of a nightmare but is powerless to intervene or flee. He saw the movements of the cupped members, he heard the single atrocious cry that was wrung from Chivers, and the swiftly ensuing scream of Maspic. Then, above the heads of his fellows, who still held their useless torches in rigid fingers, the proboscides came toward him...\n\nWith blood rilling heavily upon their faces, with the somnolent, vigilant, implacable and eyeless Shape at their heels, herding them on, restraining them when they tottered at the brink, the three began their second descent of the road that went down forever to a night-bound Avernus.",

"那团阴云如同从所罗门魔瓶中释放的巨灵，沿着行星边缘急速膨胀攀升。它化作一根锈迹斑驳的擎天巨柱，跨过死寂的荒原，在暗如沙漠咸海退潮后遗留盐沼的穹窿下昂然行进。\n\n\"看着像场该死的沙暴。\"马斯匹克评论道。\n\n\"只能是沙暴。\"贝尔曼干脆地附和，\"这地带从没出现过其他类型风暴。艾海人管这叫'祖尔斯'的地狱旋风——正朝咱们袭来。我建议立即寻找掩体。上次被祖尔斯困住的经历，可不想再尝第二口那些铁锈味的沙尘。\"\n\n\"右侧古河岸有个洞穴。\"三人中眼神如鹰隼般焦躁巡视荒漠的奇弗斯说道。这三位不屑雇佣火星向导的地球冒险家，五天前从阿霍姆前哨站出发，深入这片名为\"乔尔\"的无人区。传说在干涸千万年的古河床里，堆积着火星特有的苍白铂金，犹如盐粒般唾手可得。若能走运，他们在红色星球上不情不愿的流放岁月便将终结。尽管当地人对乔尔地区的警告言犹在耳，那些关于昔日勘探者有去无回的诡异传闻更添阴霾，但对这群视致命危险为家常便饭的亡命徒而言，只要尽头闪烁着无尽黄金的微光，哪怕直下欣嫩谷也在所不惜。\n\n他们的补给品和水桶由三头名为\"沃特拉普\"的奇特哺乳动物驮载。这些生物生着蜥蜴般的角质板甲与骆驼似的长腿长颈，虽丑陋至极却温顺耐劳，能数月不饮仍适应沙漠跋涉。\n\n过去两日他们沿着无名古河的干涸河床行进，蜿蜒穿行于亿万年风化剥蚀形成的矮丘间。除了磨损的巨砾、卵石与锈色细沙外一无所获。此前天空始终死寂如铁，连枯藓都不生的河床上更无半点生机。那团扭曲膨胀的祖尔斯沙柱，是这片死地首次显露的活物征兆。\n\n当地球人用铁尖刺棒催促懒散的沃特拉普加速时，奇弗斯发现的洞穴入口仍在三分之一英里外的高耸河岸上。未等他们抵达古河坡底，祖尔斯已吞噬烈日，众人笼罩在干涸血渍般的昏暗中。沃特拉普发出非人咆哮，攀爬着标记古水位线的阶梯状河岸。当沙柱翻腾着抵达对岸时，他们终于钻进洞穴。\n\n洞口开在铁矿脉裸露的矮崖上，虽堆满氧化铁与玄武岩碎屑，仍足以容纳全副武装的队伍。内部黑暗如蛛网密织，直到贝尔曼从行囊抽出电筒，光束才刺破阴影。光线仅照出向后方无尽黑夜延伸的洞室开端，逐渐拓宽的地面光滑似经流水打磨。\n\n随着祖尔斯逼近，洞口已陷入黑暗。勘探者们耳中灌满恶魔受阻般的诡异呜咽，原子般细微的沙粒如金刚石粉末刺痛他们的手足面目。\n\n\"这风暴至少还要持续半小时，\"贝尔曼说道。\"我们继续往洞穴里走吧？估计也找不到什么有趣或有价值的东西。但探险总归能打发时间。说不定还能碰上几颗紫红宝石或琥珀黄的蓝宝石，这类东西在沙漠洞穴里时有发现。你们俩最好也带上火把，边走边照照墙壁和地面。\"\n\n同伴们认为这个提议值得采纳。那些披着鳞甲的沃特鲁普兽对风沙毫无知觉，被留在了入口附近。奇弗斯、贝尔曼和马斯皮克举着火把前行，光束撕开浓稠的黑暗——这幽邃或许在过往无数岁月中从未被光线侵扰过。洞穴逐渐开阔起来。\n\n此地空荡得骇人，像废弃多年的墓穴般死寂。锈蚀的地面与墙壁对晃动的火光毫无反照。通道以平缓的坡度向下延伸，两侧岩壁在六七英尺高处留有水痕。无疑在远古时期，这里曾是地下支流的河道。所有碎屑都被冲刷殆尽，犹如独眼巨人建造的引水渠内部，或许直通火星地底的厄瑞玻斯。\n\n三位探险者都算不上想象力丰富或神经敏感之人。但此刻都被某种怪异感觉缠扰。在诡秘寂静的帷幕之后，他们屡屡听见微弱声响，恍若沉没海洋在地球深处某处的叹息。空气中飘散着若有若无的潮气，面颊能感受到几乎难以察觉的气流拂动。最古怪的是那股难以名状的气息，既让人联想到兽穴，又带着火星民居特有的气味。\n\n\"你们觉得会遇到什么活物吗？\"马斯皮克抽着鼻子迟疑道。\n\n\"可能性不大。\"贝尔曼以惯常的简略口吻否定道，\"连野生沃特鲁普兽都避开查尔荒漠。\"\n\n\"但空气里确实有湿气，\"马斯皮克坚持道，\"说明某处存在水源；而有水的地方就可能存在生命——也许是危险种类。\"\n\n\"我们带着左轮手枪。\"贝尔曼说，\"不过除非遇上地球来的淘金竞争者——\"他讥诮地补充道。\n\n\"听。\"奇弗斯压低嗓音，\"你们听见什么没有？\"\n\n三人同时驻足。前方黑暗深处传来绵长而暧昧的声响，混杂着不协调的元素令人困惑。既有金属拖过岩石的尖锐刮擦与咔嗒声，又仿佛无数湿润巨嘴在吧嗒作响。须臾间声响退去，消逝在显然更深的底层。\n\n\"真邪门。\"贝尔曼勉强承认道。\n\n\"是什么？\"奇弗斯追问，\"火星人传说的那种半英里长的地下千足怪物？\"\n\n\"你民间故事听太多了。\"贝尔曼责备道，\"没有地球人见过这种东西。火星上许多深层洞穴都被彻底勘探过：但像查尔这样的荒漠地带根本不存在生命。我实在想不出什么能发出那种声响；不过为了科学探索，我建议继续前进查明真相。\"\n\n\"我开始发怵了。\"马斯皮克说，\"但你们若坚持，我奉陪到底。\"\n\n不再多言，三人继续向洞穴深处进发。疾行十五分钟后，他们已深入洞穴至少半英里。地面坡度渐陡，宛如湍急河床。两侧岩壁形态也发生变化：金属质感的石台高耸，柱状凹隙在火把照射下仍深不可测。\n\n空气愈发滞重，潮湿感已毋庸置疑。陈腐的古老水汽在流动。那股混合着野兽与艾海民居的异味，也以它黏腻的恶臭污染着黑暗。\n\n贝尔曼走在最前。突然他的火把照出一道断崖边缘——古河道在此戛然而止，石台与岩壁向两侧坠入无垠虚空。他走到崖畔将光柱投向深渊，仅能照见脚边垂直没入黑暗的峭壁，根本望不到底。光束亦未能触及裂谷彼岸，那道鸿沟可能绵延数里格。\n\n\"看来我们找到了传说中的世界尽头。\"奇弗斯评论道。他四下搜寻，找到一块小圆石大小的松散岩块，奋力抛向深渊。地球人们凝神倾听坠石声响，但几分钟过去，漆黑深处始终没有回音传来。\n\n贝尔曼开始检查河道尽头两侧的断裂岩架。右侧他发现有道沿深渊边缘延伸的下斜石台，宽度约两码，坡度平缓，惊人的平整度与规律性令人联想到开凿在崖壁上的古道。岩壁悬罩其上，宛若被劈开的高拱廊残部。\n\n\"通往冥府的路就在那儿，\"贝尔曼说道，\"而且下坡相当平缓。\"\n\n\"再往前走有什么用？\"马斯皮克反问，\"就我而言，已经受够黑暗了。就算继续前进真能找到什么，也只会是毫无价值——或者令人不快的东西。\"\n\n贝尔曼迟疑片刻：\"也许你是对的。但我想沿着那道岩脊走远些，好估量这道深渊的规模。要是害怕，你和奇弗斯可以在这儿等着。\"\n\n显然，奇弗斯和马斯皮克都不愿承认内心的恐惧。他们紧贴着内壁，跟随贝尔曼沿岩架前行。而贝尔曼却漫不经心地走在边缘，手电筒微弱的光束不断被深渊吞噬。\n\n这条岩架以其均匀的宽度、倾斜度与光滑表面，以及上方半弧形的悬崖，愈发让地球来客确信这是条人工开凿的道路。但究竟是谁建造并使用它？在那些被遗忘的岁月里，它又是为何种不可告人的目的而设计？面对火星远古时代幽暗谜题中张开的巨大鸿沟，地球人的想象力显得如此苍白。\n\n贝尔曼察觉岩壁正缓慢地向内弯曲。毫无疑问，沿着这条路终将绕行整个深渊。或许它正以缓慢而巨大的螺旋向下延伸，一圈又一圈，直抵火星的脏腑深处。\n\n他与同伴们陷入越来越长的沉默。当他们前行时，深渊底部再度传来外层洞穴里那种奇特的长音——或者说复合声响，令众人毛骨悚然。此刻这声音唤起新的联想：窸窣声像是锉刀刮擦，而那轻柔、规律、密集的啪嗒声，恍若某种庞然大物将足肢拔出沼泽的动静。\n\n这难以名状的声响令人胆寒。部分恐惧源于其遥远性——似乎暗示着声源的巨大规模，更凸显出深渊的莫测。在死寂沙漠下的行星深坑里听见这种声响，既令人震惊又不安。即便是向来无畏的贝尔曼，也开始被这自黑暗中升腾的无形恐怖所侵蚀。\n\n声响逐渐微弱直至消失，仿佛制造者已沿着垂直岩壁降入深渊更底层。\n\n\"要回去吗？\"奇弗斯问道。\n\n\"也好，\"贝尔曼不假思索地同意，\"反正探索这地方怕是永无止境。\"\n\n他们开始沿岩架折返。三人此刻都因某种预警潜在危险的超感官知觉而警觉不安。尽管随着怪声消退深渊重归寂静，他们却莫名感到并非独处。无人言明这份近乎恐慌的警觉，也无人讨论他们偶然遭遇的诡异谜团。\n\n马斯皮克此刻略微领先。就在他们走完返回古老洞道至少一半路程时，他照向前方二十英尺的手电光突然映出一排灰白人形——三个并排挡住了去路。贝尔曼和奇弗斯紧随其后的手电光，以骇人的清晰度照亮了这群生物前列的肢体与面孔，却无法判断其数量。\n\n这些静止无声的生物仿佛正等待着地球人，它们大体类似艾海人（火星原住民），却呈现出极度退化畸变的形态。菌类般苍白的躯体昭示着地下生活的漫长岁月。它们体型也比成年艾海人娇小，平均约五英尺高。虽然拥有火星人标志性的宽阔鼻孔、招风耳、桶状胸和瘦长四肢——但全都缺失眼睛。某些个体面部本该长眼的位置只有浅淡的原始裂隙，另一些则残留着暗示眼球被摘除的空洞眼窝。\n\n\"天啊！多可怕的家伙！\"马斯皮克惊呼，\"它们从哪儿来的？想干什么？\"\n\n\"难以想象，\"贝尔曼说，\"但我们的处境很微妙——除非它们友善。估计我们进洞时就藏在上层岩架了。\"\n\n他大胆跨前几步越过马斯皮克，用艾海人喉音浓重的语言向它们喊话——其中许多音节地球人几乎无法发音。部分生物不安地骚动起来，发出与火星语迥异的尖细吱鸣。显然它们听不懂贝尔曼的话。而由于失明，手势交流同样徒劳。\n\n贝尔曼掏出手枪，示意同伴照做。\"我们得想办法突破，\"他说，\"如果它们非要阻挠——\"扳机扣动的咔嗒声代替了未尽之言。\n\n仿佛金属声响正是期待的信号，那群盲眼苍白生物突然齐刷刷扑向地球人。它们的进攻如同机械般精准——在某种隐秘力量驱使下，展现出协调有序、势不可挡的机械式推进。\n\n贝尔曼在极近距离扣动了扳机，一次，两次，三次。如此近距离开火绝无失手可能；但子弹却如同投入汹涌激流的小石子般徒劳无功。那些无目的生物并未退缩，尽管其中两个开始渗出黄红色液体——那是火星人特有的血液。为首的生物毫发无伤，以恶魔般的精准抓住贝尔曼的手臂，四节长指在他再次扣动扳机前就夺走了左轮手枪。诡异的是，这生物并未夺取他左手握持的电筒；他看见柯尔特手枪在火星人手中划出钢铁般的弧光，坠入无边的黑暗深渊。随后，那些菌类般惨白的躯体在狭窄道路上可怕地蠕动着，将他团团围住，拥挤得连有效反抗的空间都不复存在。\n\n奇弗斯与马斯皮克开了几枪后同样被缴械，但通过某种诡异的区别对待，他们被允许保留手电筒。\n\n整个变故不过瞬息之间。前进的队伍只短暂停滞了片刻——奇弗斯与马斯皮克击倒的两名成员已被同伴迅速抛入深渊。前排队伍灵巧地分开，将地球人裹挟其中，迫使他们调转方向。紧接着，他们被牢牢钳制在这具移动的肉体钳口中，不可抗拒地被推向前方。因担心跌落手电而束手束脚的他们，在这梦魇般的洪流前无能为力。随着可怖的大步流星，他们沿着通向深渊更深处的路径狂奔，眼前只能看到前方生物被照亮的背部与肢体，最终成为这支无目神秘军团的一部分。\n\n他们身后似乎有数十个火星人正冷酷地驱赶着他们。过不了多久，这种处境便开始麻痹他们的神智。他们的步伐不再像人类，反而如同周围那些黏湿生物般迅捷而机械。思维、意志乃至恐惧，都被那些迈向深渊的脚步所携带的非人节奏所冻结。受此束缚，加之彻底脱离现实的感受，他们仅以漫长间隔吐出只言片语，这些音节如同机械发声般丧失了全部意义。盲眼族群始终沉默——除了无数永恒踩踏石块的轻柔声响外，万籁俱寂。\n\n他们不断前进，穿越不属于任何昼夜周期的漆黑时光。道路缓慢而扭曲地向内盘旋，仿佛缠绕在某座盲目宇宙巴别塔的内壁上。地球人感觉自己必定已在这骇人螺旋中环绕深渊多次；但他们行进的距离，以及这令人窒息的深渊实际规模，都远超想象。\n\n若无手电照明，这里的黑夜绝对而永恒。它比太阳更古老，在过去所有世代中始终在此蛰伏。它如 monstrous burden般在他们头顶积聚；在脚下恐怖地裂开。停滞水体日益浓烈的恶臭从中升起。然而除了那些迈向无底深渊阿巴顿的规律脚步声外，依旧万籁俱寂。\n\n仿佛历经漫漫长夜后，向地心冲刺的进程终于在某处停止。贝尔曼、奇弗斯与马斯皮克感到拥挤躯体的压力消散；意识到自己静止站立时，大脑却仍延续着那可怖下降的非人节奏。\n\n理智——与恐惧——缓慢回归。贝尔曼举起手电，旋转的光束重新捕捉到火星人群，其中许多正分散到环绕深渊的道路尽头处的巨大洞窟中。但仍有部分生物留下，仿佛要监视地球人。它们对贝尔曼的动作警觉地颤动，似乎通过某种未知感官感知着一切。\n\n右侧近处，平坦地面突然中断。贝尔曼走到边缘，发现洞窟竟是垂直岩壁上的开放式厅堂。下方极远之处的黑暗中，磷光如冥界海洋的夜光虫般摇曳。缓慢腐朽的风拂过他；他听见沉没悬崖周围水体发出的诡异叹息：在这颗星球干涸的无数周期中，这些水流不断退却。\n\n他眩晕地转身。同伴们正在探查洞穴内部。此地似乎出自人工开凿；因为四处扫射的手电光束映照出刻有深浮雕的巨型柱廊。何人何时雕刻了它们？这些问题与悬崖道路的起源同样无解。其细节如疯狂幻象般淫秽，对视觉的冲击堪比重击，在闪现瞬间传递着超乎人类的邪恶与无底线的恶毒。\n\n洞窟确实大得惊人，深入岩壁后方，并有许多出口无疑通向更复杂的支路。手电光束惊动了壁龛中拍打的阴影；捕捉到远处墙面攀入不可及黑暗的凸起；照亮那些如活体巨菌般来回移动的生物；让那些病态依附在夜石上的苍白息肉状植物短暂现形。\n\n此地具有压倒性力量，压迫感官，碾碎理智。岩石本身就像黑暗的具象化；而光明与视觉在这盲者国度不过是短暂入侵者。地球人们莫名被无法逃脱的信念压垮。一种奇特的倦怠感攫住了他们。他们甚至没有讨论处境，只是无精打采地沉默站立。\n\n不久，更多火星人从污秽黑暗中重现。带着标志性受控自动行为的特征，它们再次围住人类，催促他们进入张着大口的洞窟。\n\n三人一步步被卷入这怪异腐朽的行列。淫秽的柱群不断增多，洞穴在他们面前展现出无尽景象，如同揭示沉睡在夜之底部的污秽之物。起初微弱，但随着深入逐渐强烈的，是一种隐秘的昏睡感——仿佛由有毒瘴气引起。他们抗拒这种感觉，因为这昏睡莫名黑暗邪恶。当压迫感愈发沉重时——他们抵达了恐怖的核心。\n\n在粗壮且看似无顶的立柱之间，地面隆起形成七层斜金字塔状祭坛。顶端蹲坐着一尊苍白金属像：体型不过野兔大小，却狰狞得超乎想象。\n\n火星人簇拥着地球人。其中一个拉住贝尔曼手臂，似在催促他登上祭坛。他以梦游者的缓慢步伐攀上斜坡，奇弗斯与马斯皮克紧随其后。\n\n这尊神像与他们在红色星球——或其他任何地方——所见皆不相同。它由淡金色金属雕成，呈现某种驼背动物形态，光滑悬垂的甲壳下伸出龟类般的头足。头部恶毒地扁平呈三角——且无目。从残忍裂缝嘴角下垂处，两根长鼻状物向上弯曲，末端中空如杯。这生物有一系列短腿均匀分布在甲壳下，而奇特的双尾在蹲伏身躯下盘绕成辫。足部圆润，形似倒置的小高脚杯。\n\n如同某种返祖疯狂的产物，这尊肮脏兽性的偶像似乎在祭坛上假寐。它以缓慢隐秘的恐怖侵扰心智，用散发的麻木感冲击感官——如同光明创生前的原始世界渗出物，生命可能在盲目黏液中懒散地滋生与掠夺。\n\n地球人朦胧看见祭坛上挤满盲眼火星人，它们正绕过他们触摸神像。仿佛在进行某种诡异的触觉仪式，这些生物用细长手指爱抚偶像，描摹其可憎轮廓。它们野蛮面容上镌刻着麻醉般的狂喜。如同可憎梦境的梦游者，贝尔曼、奇弗斯与马斯皮克被迫效仿。\n\n触碰之处冰冷黏腻，仿佛刚从黏液床榻取出。但它似乎在指尖下搏动膨胀。从中涌出沉重无尽的黑暗波动：一种蒙蔽双眼的麻醉力量；将恶毒睡意注入血液。\n\n他们的感官在诡异的黑暗中漂浮，隐约察觉到祭坛顶端拥挤躯体带来的压迫感。不久，其中几人仿佛饱尝了迷药般的氤氲气息，踉跄后退着将他们带往倾斜的阶梯，直至洞窟底层。他们僵直的手指仍紧握火把，看见无数白化生物正为那亵渎仪式聚集于此。男人们透过愈发浓稠的阴影，目睹这些生物在金字塔表面翻涌蠕动，犹如一道活着的麻风病饰带。\n\n奇弗斯与马斯皮克最先屈服于无形之力，彻底昏睡倒地。而更具抵抗力的贝尔曼却仿佛坠入无光梦境。他的知觉扭曲成难以名状的异态，无处不在的蛰伏伟力令他窒息——那是种散发着瘴气般睡意的、不可名状的存在。在逐渐模糊的梦境里，他遗失了最后一丝人性，竟与无目族类产生了身份认同：他如他们一般生活，在幽深洞窟与永夜道路上穿行。可同时他又化身为另一种存在——统御盲目者的无名之主，蛰伏于远古腐水与深渊底部、定期现身进行不可言说掠食的秽物。在这双重身份中，他既在盲目盛宴上餍足，亦被分而食之。而那座神像始终如第三重身份纠缠着他——仅存触觉感知，却无视觉记忆。这里没有光，甚至不存在关于光的记忆。\n\n他无从知晓自己是从这场噩梦坠入无梦沉睡，还是直接惊醒。起初，昏沉苏醒如同梦境的延续。当他费力撑开黏腻的眼睑，看见地上火把投出的光柱正照向某个因药性而难以辨认的物体。那东西却令他不安，渐渐苏醒的恐惧激活了他的神志。\n\n他逐渐看清那是一只被啃噬过半的无目穴居者残躯。部分肢体已消失不见，残余部分连那些结构奇特的骨骼都留有齿痕。\n\n贝尔曼摇晃着起身，视野仍蒙着蛛网般的阴翳。奇弗斯与马斯皮克如死尸般昏睡在侧，洞窟各处与七层祭坛上则横陈着沉睡的信徒们。\n\n其他感官陆续苏醒时，他听见某种似曾相识的声响：尖锐的滑行声夹杂着规律的吮吸。声源正退往石柱群后方，消失于沉睡躯体之间。腐水气息弥漫空气，石地上布满杯缘般的湿痕圆环。这些痕迹从残缺尸体延伸至深渊边缘的外洞阴影——正是诡异声响最终消逝的方向。\n\n贝尔曼心中疯长的恐惧与残留的麻痹感撕扯着。他粗暴摇醒两位同伴，直到他们发出昏沉的抗议。\"快起来，\"他厉声道，\"要逃离这地狱，此刻是唯一机会。\"\n\n经过连番咒骂与拖拽，他终于让同伴踉跄跟上自己。他们蹒跚穿过横七竖八的火星人，远离那座仍散发着恶毒催眠气息的白色神像。\n\n贝尔曼感到沉重迷雾正在消散。意志力逐渐恢复的他渴望逃离深渊及其黑暗子民。而另外两人仍深陷昏睡魔力，如牲畜般麻木地跟随他。\n\n他确信能循原路返回祭坛——那些腐臭湿痕也指向同一方向。在令人作呕的雕纹石柱间跋涉许久后，他们终于来到黑色塔尔塔罗斯的门槛，俯瞰最终深渊。下方腐水表面，磷光正扩散成环状，仿佛被重物坠落惊扰。湿痕圆环一直延伸至他们脚边的岩地。\n\n贝尔曼颤抖着转身，在洞窟转角找到那条沿深渊而上的归途——通往失落阳光的救赎之路。\n\n他命令同伴关闭手电以节约电量。这些光源随时可能耗尽，而光明是他们生存的关键。他的火把将支撑三人直至熄灭。\n\n沉睡火星人所在的洞窟毫无声息。但贝尔曼在入口聆听时，某种超越所有冒险经历的恐惧使他几欲昏厥。\n\n深渊同样寂静，水面磷光涟漪也已平息。可这种寂静本身却如黏稠的深渊淤泥般阻滞感官、拖慢步伐。贝尔曼必须挣扎才能开始攀登，他踢打着同伴直到他们如梦游动物般响应。\n\n这仿佛穿越灵薄狱的攀登，是从最底层的黏稠黑暗中向上挣扎。他们沿单调蜿蜒的坡道无止境前行，距离感早已丧失，时间仅以重复的脚步丈量。微弱火光前的夜色如吞噬一切的海浪般耐心等待着光明熄灭的时刻。\n\n贝尔曼不时瞥见深渊磷光正逐渐黯淡。荒诞意象涌入脑海：犹如地狱之火最后的余烬，又似宇宙虚空中湮灭的星云。俯视无限虚空带来的眩晕中...最终只剩黑暗，而这昭示着他们已攀升至可怕高度。\n\n饥渴与疲惫皆被驱使他逃命的恐惧碾碎。马斯皮克和奇弗斯也缓慢摆脱麻木，开始感受到如夜色般浩瀚的恐惧阴影。贝尔曼不再需要踢打驱赶他们前进。\n\n古老而邪恶的夜色如蝙蝠腐臭的厚毛般包裹着他们，成为阻塞肺部的实体，麻痹所有感官。这寂静如同死寂世界的沉睡...但在仿佛经年累月的静默后，熟悉的双重声响再度响起并追上逃亡者：深渊深处某物滑过石面的声音，以及如同从沼泽拔足而起的吮吸声。这难以解释的声响唤起疯狂荒诞的联想，如谵妄中的幻听般将三人的恐惧瞬间引爆至癫狂。\n\n\"上帝啊！那是什么？\"贝尔曼喘息道。他仿佛忆起了那些无目可睹、令人憎恶却又触手可及的原初黑夜形体——这些绝非人类记忆应有的存在。洞穴中的梦境与噩梦惊醒、白色幻影、地下悬崖被啃噬过半的穴居人、通往深渊的潮湿环痕，此刻全都如疯狂谵妄的幻象般涌来，在这条介于火星地表与地下海之间的恐怖道路上将他彻底吞噬。\n\n唯有持续不断的异响回应着他的疑问。那声音愈发响亮——正从下方岩壁攀援而上。马斯皮克与奇弗斯猛地打开探照灯，开始疯狂跳跃着奔逃；贝尔曼也终于崩溃，紧随其后。\n\n这是一场与未知恐怖的赛跑。即便心跳如擂、脚步沉重，三人仍能听见那阴森莫测的响动。他们仿佛在无尽黑暗中狂奔，而那声响却越来越近，如同某种能在垂直峭壁行走的生物正从下方逼近。\n\n此刻异响已近在咫尺——且略超前于他们。它突然静止。并排奔跑的马斯皮克与奇弗斯将灯光投向两码宽的岩架，照见了那个盘踞其上、堵住去路的生物。\n\n纵使是久经沙场的探险家，若非眼前景象令他们陷入强直性昏厥，此刻定会歇斯底里地尖叫或跳崖自尽。那分明是金字塔中苍白神像的活体化身，却膨胀到庞然巨物般可怖，正从深渊爬出蹲踞在他们面前！\n\n这显然正是那座亵渎雕像的原型。隆起的巨大甲壳隐约让人想起雕齿兽的护甲，却泛着湿漉漉的白金色光泽。无目的头颅既警觉又昏沉，从淫邪弯曲的颈项前探出。十余条短肢从悬垂甲壳下斜伸而出，末端呈杯状。两条一码长的管状器官从它残忍裂口的嘴角伸出，末端如杯盏般向地球人缓缓摆动。\n\n这生物似乎与这颗垂死行星同龄，是始终栖息在洞穴水域的未知原始生命形态。面对它时，地球人的感官如同先前遭遇幻影时那样，陷入了邪恶的麻痹状态。他们僵立着将手电光柱投向这恐怖存在，当它突然直立展现棱纹腹部与在岩石上金属般沙沙滑行的怪异双尾时，竟无法动弹亦不能呼喊。此刻可见它众多中空的杯状足肢正渗出毒雾般的黏液——无疑这些吸盘能使其垂直行走。\n\n怪物以后足短促跨步，以尾部为杠杆，以难以置信的精准与迅捷扑向毫无反抗之力的人类。两条管状器官精准地弯曲，杯状末端落在仰着脸的奇弗斯眼窝上——仅仅停留一瞬。当它如毒蛇甩尾般灵巧有力地抽离时，撕心裂肺的惨叫顿时响彻洞穴。\n\n奇弗斯缓慢摇晃着脑袋，在半麻痹的痛苦中扭曲身体。身旁的马斯皮克如梦游般呆滞地注视着他那空洞淌血的眼眶——这将成为他此生所见的最后景象。刹那间怪物转向马斯皮克，滴落鲜血与恶臭的恐怖杯盏覆上了他的双眼。\n\n稍落后的贝尔曼如同噩梦见证者般清醒地明白正在发生的一切，却无力干预或逃离。他目睹杯状器官的动作，听见奇弗斯发出的凄厉惨叫与马斯皮克紧随其后的尖叫。随后，那对管状器官越过同伴们仍紧握手电的僵硬躯体，向他蜿蜒而来......\n\n鲜血从他们脸上汩汩流下，那个昏沉、警觉、冷酷的无目形体紧随其后，时而驱赶，时而在他们濒临坠落时阻拦。三人开始了第二次永恒下坠，这条道路将永远通往黑夜笼罩的冥河深渊。"

        "content": "\n\nTo a cursory observer, it might have seemed that Bob Haines and Paul Septimus Chanler had little enough in common, other than the predicament of being stranded without funds on an alien world.\n\nHaines, the third assistant pilot of an ether-liner, had been charged with insubordination by his superiors, and had been left behind in Ignarh, the commercial metropolis of Mars, and the port of all space-traffic. The charge against him was wholly a matter of personal spite; but so far, Haines had not succeeded in finding a new berth; and the month's salary paid to him at parting had been devoured with appalling swiftness by the pirate rates of the Tellurian Hotel.\n\nChanler, a professional writer of interplanetary fiction, had made voyage to Mars to fortify his imaginative talent by a solid groundwork of observation and experience. His money had given out after a few weeks; and fresh supplies, expected from his publisher, had not yet arrived.\n\nThe two men, apart from their misfortunes, shared an illimitable curiosity concerning all things Martian. Their thirst for the exotic, their proclivity for wandering into places usually avoided by terrestrials, had drawn them together in spite of obvious differences of temperament and had made them fast friends.\n\nTrying to forget their worries, they had spent the past day in the queerly piled and huddled maze of old Ignarh, called by the Martians Ignar-Vath, on the eastern side of the great Yahan Canal. Returning at the sunset hour, and following the estrade of purple marble beside the water, they had nearly reached the mile-long bridge that would take them back to the modern city, Ignar-Luth, in which were the terrestrial consulates and shipping-offices and hotels.\n\nIt was the Martian hour of worship, when the Aihais gather in their roofless temples to implore the return of the passing sun. Like the throbbing of feverish metal pulses, a sound of ceaseless and innumerable gongs punctured the thin air. The incredibly crooked streets were almost empty; and only a few barges, with immense rhomboidal sails of mauve and scarlet, crawled to and fro on the somber green waters.\n\nThe light waned with visible swiftness behind the top-heavy towers and pagoda-angled pyramids of Ignar-Luth. The chill of the coming night began to pervade the shadows of the huge solar gnomons that lined the canal at frequent intervals. The querulous clangors of the gongs died suddenly in Ignar-Vath, and left a weirdly whispering silence. The buildings of the immemorial city bulked enormous upon a sky of blackish emerald that was already thronged with icy stars.\n\nA medley of untraceable exotic odors was wafted through the twilight. The perfume was redolent of alien mystery, and it thrilled and troubled the Earthmen, who became silent as they approached the bridge, feeling the oppression of eery strangeness that gathered from all sides in the thickening gloom. More deeply than in daylight, they apprehended the muffled breathings and hidden, tortuous movements of a life for ever inscrutable to the children of other planets. The void between Earth and Mars had been traversed; but who could cross the evolutionary gulf between Earthman and Martian?\n\nThe people were friendly enough in their taciturn way: they had tolerated the intrusion of terrestrials, had permitted commerce between the worlds. Their languages had been mastered, their history studied, by terrene savants. But it seemed that there could be no real interchange of ideas. Their civilization had grown old in diverse complexity before the foundering of Lemuria; its sciences, arts, religions, were hoary with inconceivable age; and even the simplest customs were the fruit of alien forces and conditions.\n\nAt that moment, faced with the precariousness of their situation, Haines and Chanler felt an actual terror of the unknown world that surrounded them with its measureless antiquity.\n\nThey quickened their paces. The wide pavement that bordered the canal was seemingly deserted; and the light, railless bridge itself was guarded only by the ten colossal statues of Martian heroes that loomed in war-like attitudes before the beginning of the first aerial span.\n\nThe Earthmen were somewhat startled when a living figure, little less gigantic than the carven images, detached itself from their deepening shadows and came forward with mighty strides.\n\nThe figure, nearly ten foot in height, was taller by a full yard than the average Aihai, but presented the familiar conformation of massively bulging chest and bony, many-angled limbs. The head was featured with high-flaring ears and pit-like nostrils that narrowed and expanded visibly in the twilight. The eyes were sunken in profound orbits, and were wholly invisible, save for tiny reddish sparks that appeared to burn suspended in the sockets of a skull. According to native customs, this bizarre personage was altogether nude; but a kind of circlet around the neck—a flat wire of curiously beaten silver—indicated that he was the servant of some noble lord.\n\nHaines and Chanler were astounded, for they had never before seen a Martian of such prodigious stature. The apparition, it was plain, desired to intercept them. He paused before them on the pavement of blockless marble. They were even more amazed by the weirdly booming voice, reverberant as that of some enormous frog, with which he began to address them. In spite of the interminably guttural tone, the heavy slurring of certain vowels and consonants, they realized that the words were those of human language.\n\n\"My master summons you,\" bellowed the colossus. \"Your plight is known to him. He will help you liberally, in return for a certain assistance which you can render him. Come with me.\"\n\n\"This sounds peremptory,\" murmured Haines. \"Shall we go? Probably it's some charitable Aihai prince, who has gotten wind of our reduced circumstances. Wonder what the game is?\"\n\n\"I suggest that we follow the guide,\" said Chanler, eagerly. \"His proposition sounds like the first chapter of a thriller.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Haines, to the towering giant. \"Lead us to your master.\"\n\nWith strides that were moderated to match those of the Earthmen, the colossus led them away from the hero-guarded bridge and into the greenish-purple gloom that had inundated Ignar-Vath. Beyond the pavement, an alley yawned like a high-mouthed cavern between lightless mansions and warehouses whose broad balconies and jutting roofs were almost conterminous in mid-air. The alley was deserted; and the Aihai moved like an overgrown shadow through the dusk and paused shadow-like in a deep and lofty doorway. Halting at his heels, Chanler and Haines were aware of a shrill metallic stridor, made by the opening of the door, which, like all Martian doors, was drawn upward in the manner of a medieval portcullis. Their guide was silhouetted on the saffron light that poured from bosses of radio-active mineral set in the walls and roof of a circular ante-chamber. He preceded them, according to custom: and following, they saw that the room was unoccupied. The door descended behind them without apparent agency or manipulation.\n\nTo Chanler, gazing about the windowless chamber, there came the indefinable alarm that is sometimes felt in a closed space. Under the circumstances, there seemed to be no reason to apprehend danger or treachery; but all at once he was filled with a wild longing to escape.\n\nHaines, on his part, was wondering rather perplexedly why the inner door was closed and why the master of the house had not already appeared to receive them. Somehow, the house impressed him as being uninhabited; there was something empty and desolate in the silence that surrounded them.\n\nThe Aihai, standing in the center of the bare, unfurnished room, had faced about as if to address the Earthmen. His eyes glowered inscrutably from their deep orbits; his mouth opened, showing double rows of snaggy teeth. But no sound appeared to issue from his moving lips; and the notes that he emitted must have belonged to that scale of overtones, beyond human audition, of which the Martian voice is capable. No doubt the mechanism of the door had been actuated by similar overtones; and now, as if in response, the entire floor of the chamber, wrought of dark, seamless metal, began to descend slowly, as if dropping into a great pit. Haines and Chanler, startled, saw the saffron lights receding above them. They, together with the giant, were going down into shadow and darkness, in a broad circular shaft. There was a ceaseless grating and shrieking of metal, setting their teeth on edge with its insupportable pitch.\n\nLike a narrowing cluster of yellow stars, the lights grew dim and small above them. Still their descent continued; and they could no longer discern each other's faces, or the face of the Aihai, n the ebon blackness through which they fell. Haines and Chanler were beset with a thousand doubts and suspicions, and they began to wonder if they had been somewhat rash in accepting the Aihai's invitation.\n\n\"Where are you taking us?\" said Haines bluntly. \"Does your master live underground?\"\n\n\"We go to my master,\" replied the Martian with cryptic finality. \"He awaits you.\n\nThe cluster of lights had become a single star, had dwindled and faded as if in the night of infinity. There was a sense of irredeemable depth, as if they had gone down to the very core of that alien world. The strangeness of their situation filled the Earthmen with increasing disquiet. They had committed themselves to a clueless mystery that began to savor of menace and peril. Nothing was to be learned from their conductor. No retreat was possible—and they were both weaponless.\n\nThe strident shrieking of metal slowed and sank to a sullen whine. The Earthmen were dazzled by the ruddy brilliance that broke upon them through a circle of slender pillars that had replaced the walls of the shaft. An instant more, while they went down through the flooding light, and then the floor beneath them became stationary. They saw that it was now part of the floor of a great cavern lit by crimson hemispheres embedded in the roof. The cavern was circular, with passages that ramified from it in every direction, like the spokes of a wheel from the hub. Many Martians, no less gigantic than the guide, were passing swiftly to and fro, as if intent on enigmatic errands. The strange, muted clangors and thunder-like rumblings of hidden machinery throbbed in the air, vibrated in the shaken floor.\n\n\"What do you suppose we've gotten into?\" murmured Chanler. \"We must be many miles below the surface. I've never heard of anything like this, except in some of the old Aihai myths. This place might be Ravormos, the Martian underworld, where Vulthoom, the evil god, is supposed to lie asleep for a thousand years amid his worshippers.\"\n\nThe guide had overheard him. \"You have come to Ravormos,\" he boomed portentously. \"Vulthoom is awake, and will not sleep again for another thousand years. It is he that has summoned you; and I take you now to the chamber of audience.\"\n\nHames and Chanler, dumbfounded beyond measure, followed the Martian from the strange elevator toward one of the ramifying passages.\n\n\"There must be some sort of foolery on foot,\" muttered Haines. \"I've heard of Vulthoom, too, but he's a mere superstition, like Satan. The up-to-date Martians don't believe in him nowadays; though I have heard that there is still a sort of devil-cult among the pariahs and low-castes. I'll wager that some noble is trying to stage a revolution against the reigning emperor, Cykor, and has established his quarters underground.\"\n\n\"That sounds reasonable,\" Chanler agreed. \"A revolutionist might call himself Vulthoom: the trick would be true to the Aihai psychology. They have a taste for high-sounding metaphors and fantastic titles.\"\n\nBoth became silent, feeling a sort of awe before the vastness of the cavern-world whose litten corridors reached away on every hand. The surmises they had voiced began to appear inadequate: the improbable was verified, the fabulous had become the factual, and was engulfing them more and more. The far, mysterious clangors, it seemed, were of preternormal origin; the hurrying giants who passed athwart the chamber with unknown burdens conveyed a sense of supernatural activity and enterprise. Haines and Chanler were both tall and stalwart, but the Martians about them were all nine or ten feet in height. Some were closer to eleven feet, and all were muscled in proportion. Their faces bore a look of immense, mummy-like age, incongruous with their agility and vigor.\n\nHaines and Chanler were led along a corridor from whose arched roof the red hemispheres, doubtless formed of artificially radio-active metal, glared down at intervals like imprisoned suns. Leaping from step to step, they descended a flight of giant stairs, with the Martian striding easily before them. He paused at the open portals of a chamber hewn in the dark and basic adamantine stone. \"Enter,\" Ire said, and withdrew his bulk to let them pass.\n\nThe chamber was small but lofty, its roof rising like the interior of spire. Its floor and walls were stained by the bloody violet beams of single hemisphere far up in the narrowing dome. The place was vacant, and furnished only with a curious tripod of black metal, fixed in the center of the floor. The tripod bore an oval block of crystal, and from this block, as if from a frozen pool, a frozen flower lifted, opening petals of smooth, heavy ivory that received a rosy tinge from the strange light. Block, flower, tripod, it seemed, were the parts of a piece of sculpture.\n\nCrossing the threshold, the Earthmen became instantly aware that the throbbing thunders and cave-reverberant clangors had ebbed away in profound silence. It was is if they had entered a sanctuary from which all sound was excluded by a mystic barrier. Tire portals remained open behind them. Their guide, apparently, had withdrawn. But, somehow, they felt that they were not alone, and it seemed that hidden eyes were peering upon them from the blank walls.\n\nPerturbed and puzzled, they stared at the pale flower, noting thin seven tongue-like petals that curled softly outward from a perforated heart like a small censer. Chanler began to wonder if it were really carving, or an actual flower that had been mineralized through Martian chemistry. Then, startlingly, a voice appeared to issue from the blossom: a voice incredibly sweet, clear and sonorous, whose tones, perfectly articulate, were neither those of Aihai nor Earthman.\n\n\"I, who speak, am the entity known as Vulthoom,\" said the voice \"Be not surprised, or frightened: it is my desire to befriend you in return for a consideration which, I hope, you will not find impossible. First of all, however, I must explain certain matters that perplex you\n\n\"No doubt you have heard the popular legends concerning me, and have dismissed them as mere superstitions. Like all myths, they are partly true and partly false. I am neither god nor demon, but a being who came to Mars from another universe in former cycles. Though I am not immortal, my span of life is far longer than that of any creature evolved by the worlds of your solar system. I am governed by alien biologic laws, with periods of alternate slumber and wakefulness that involve centuries. It is virtually true, as the Aihais believe, that I sleep for a thousand years and remain conscious continually for another thousand.\n\n\"At a time when your ancestors were still the blood-brothers of the ape, I fled from my own world to this intercosmic exile, banished by implacable foes. The Martians say that I fell from heaven like a fiery meteor; and the myth interprets the descent of my ether-ship. I found a matured civilization, immensely inferior, however, to that from which I came.\n\n\"The kings and hierarchs of the planet would have driven me away; but I gathered a few adherents, arming them with weapons superior to those of Martian science; and after a great war, I established myself firmly and gained other followers. I did not care to conquer Mars, but withdrew to this cavern-world in which I have dwelt ever since with my adherents. On these, for their faithfulness, I conferred a longevity that is almost equal to my own. To ensure this longevity, I have also given them the gift of a slumber corresponding to mine. They sleep and wake with me.\n\n\"We have maintained this order of existence for many ages. Seldom have I meddled in the doings of the surface-dwellers. They, however, have converted me into an evil god or spirit; though evil, to me, is a word without meaning.\n\n\"I am the possessor of many senses and faculties unknown to you or to the Martians. My perceptions, at will, can be extended over large areas of space, or even time. Thus I learned your predicament; and I have called you here with the hope of obtaining your consent to a certain plan. To be brief, I have grown weary of Mars, a senile world that draws near to death; and I wish to establish myself in a younger planet. The Earth would serve my purpose well. Even now, my followers are building the new ether-ship in which I propose to make the voyage.\n\n\"I do not wish to repeat the experience of my arrival in Mars by landing among a people ignorant of me and perhaps universally hostile. You, being Earthmen, could prepare many of your fellows for my coming, could gather proselytes to serve me. Your reward—and theirs—would be the elixir of longevity. And I have many other gifts... the precious gems and metals that you prize so highly. Also, there are the flowers, whose perfume is more seductive and persuasive than all else. Inhaling that perfumes, you will deem that even gold is worthless in comparison... and having breathed it, you, and all others of your kind, will serve me gladly.\"\n\nThe voice ended, leaving a vibration that thrilled the nerves of the listeners for some moments. It was like the cessation of a sweet, bewitching music with overtones of evil scarcely to be detected above the subtle melody. It bemused the senses of Haines and Chanler, lulling their astonishment into a sort of dreamy acceptance of the voice and its declarations.\n\nChanler made an effort to throw off the enchantment.\n\n\"Where are you?\" he said. \"And how are we to know that you have told us the truth?\"\n\n\"I am near you,\" said the voice, \"but I do not choose, at this time to reveal myself. The proof of all that I have stated, however, will be revealed to you in due course. Before you is one of the flowers of which I have spoken. It is not, as you have perhaps surmised, a work of sculpture, but it is an antholite, or fossil blossom, brought, with others of the same kind, from the world to which I am native. Though scentless at ordinary temperatures, it yields a perfume under the application of heat. As to the perfume... you must judge for yourselves.\"\n\nThe air of the chamber had been neither warm nor cold. Now, the Earthmen were conscious of a change, as if hidden fires had been ignited. The warmth seemed to issue from the metal tripod and the block of crystal, beating upon Haines and Chanler like the radiation of some invisible tropic sun. It became ardent but not insupportable. At the same time, insidiously, the terrestrials began to perceive the perfume, which was like nothing they had ever inhaled. An elusive thread of other-world sweetness, it curled about their nostrils, deepening slowly but acceleratively to a spicy flood, and seeming to mix a pleasant coolness as of foliage-shaded air with the fervent heat.\n\nChanler was more vividly affected than Haines by the curious hallucinations that followed; though, apart from this differing degree of verisimilitude, their impressions were oddly alike. It seemed to Chanler, all at once, that the perfume was no longer wholly alien to him, but was something that he had remembered from other times and places. He tried to recall the circumstances of this prior familiarity, and his recollections, drawn up as if from the sealed reservoirs of an old existence, took the form of an actual scene that replaced the cavern-chamber about him. Haines was no part of this scene, but had disappeared from his ken, and the roof and walls had vanished, giving place to an open forest of fern-like trees. Their slim, pearly boles and tender frondage swam in a luminous glory, like an Eden filled with the primal daybreak. The trees were tall, but taller still than they were the flowers that poured down from waving censers of carnal white an overwhelming and voluptuous perfume.\n\nChanler felt an indescribable ecstasy. It seemed that he had gone back to the fountains of time in the first world, and had drawn into himself inexhaustible life, youth and vigor from the glorious light and fragrance that had steeped his senses to their last nerve.\n\nThe ecstasy heightened, and he heard a singing that appeared to emanate from the mouths of the blossoms: a singing as of houris, that turned his blood to a golden philtre-brew. In the delirium of his faculties, the sound was identified with the blossoms' odor. It rose in giddying rapture insuppressible; and he thought that the very flowers soared like flames, and the trees aspired toward them, and he himself was a blown fire that towered with the singing to attain some ultimate pinnacle of delight. The whole world swept upward in a tide of exaltation, and it seemed that the singing turned to articulate sound, and Chanler heard the words, \"I am Vulthoom, and thou art mine from the beginning of worlds, and shalt be mine until the end...\"\n\nHe awoke under circumstances that might almost have been a continuation of the visionary imagery he had beheld under the influence of the perfume. He lay on a bed of short, curling grass the color of verd-antique, with enormous tiger-hued blossoms leaning about him, and a soft brilliance as of amber sunset filling his eyes between the trailing boughs of strange, crimson-fruited trees. Tardily, as he grew cognizant of his surroundings, he realized that the voice of Haines had awakened him, and saw that Haines was sitting near at hand on the curious sward.\n\n\"Say, aren't you ever corning out of it?\" Chanler heard the crisp query as if through a film of dreams. His thoughts were bewildered, and his memories were oddly mixed with the pseudo-recollections, drawn as if from other lives, that had risen before him in his delirium. It was hard to disentangle the false from the real; but sanity returned to him by degrees; and with it come a feeling of profound exhaustion and nerve-weariness, which warned him that he had sojourned in the spurious paradise of a potent drug.\n\n\"Where are we now? and how did we get here?\" he asked.\n\n\"As far as I can tell,\" returned Haines, \"we're in a sort of underground garden. Some of those big Aihais must have brought us here after we succumbed to the perfume. I resisted the influence longer than you did; and I remember hearing the voice of Vulthoom as I went under. The voice said that he would give us forty-eight hours, terrestrial time, in which to think over his proposition. If we accept, he'll send us back to Ignarh with a fabulous sum of money—and a supply of those narcotic flowers.\"\n\nChanler was now fully awake. He and Haines proceeded to discuss their situation, but were unable to arrive at any definite conclusion. The whole affair was no less baffling than extraordinary. An unknown entity, naming himself after the Martian Devil, had invited them to become his terrestrial agents or emissaries Apart from the spreading of a propaganda designed to facilitate his advent on Earth, they were to introduce an alien drug that was no less powerful than morphine, cocaine, or marihuana—and, in all likelihood, no less pernicious.\n\n\"What if we refuse?\" said Chanler.\n\n\"Vulthoom said that it would be impossible to let us return, in that case. But he didn't specify our fate—merely hinted that it would be unpleasant.\" \"Well, Haines, we've got to think our way out of this, if we can\"\n\n\"I'm afraid that thinking won't help us much. We must be many miles below the surface of Mars and the mechanism of the elevators, in all probability, is something that no Earthman could ever learn.\" Before Chanler could offer any comment, one of the giant Aihais appeared among the trees, carrying two of the curious Martian utensils known as kulpai. These were large platters of semi-metallic earthenware, fitted with removable cups and rotatory carafes, in which an entire meal of liquids and solids could be served. The Aihai set the platters on the ground before Haines and Chanler, and then waited, immobile and inscrutable. The Earthmen, conscious of a ravening hunger, addressed themselves to the foodstuffs, which had been molded or cut into various geometric forms. Though possibly of synthetic origin, the foods were delicious, and the Earthmen consumed them to the last cone and lozenge, and washed them down with a vinous garnet-colored liquor from the carafes.\n\nWhen they had finished, their attendant spoke for the first time.\n\n\"It is the will of Vulthoom that you should wander throughout Ravormos and behold the wonders of the caverns. You are at liberty to roam alone and unattended; or, if you prefer, I shall serve you as a guide. My name is Ta-Vho-Shai, and I am ready to answer any questions that you ask. Also, you may dismiss me at will.\"\n\nHaines and Chanler, after a brief discussion, decided to accept this offer of ciceronage. They followed the Aihai through the garden, whose extent was hard to determine because of the misty amber luminance that filled it as if with radiant atoms, giving the impression of unbounded space. The light, they learned from Ta-Vho-Shai, was emitted by the lofty roof and walls beneath the action of an electromagnetic force of wave-length shorter even than the cosmic rays; and it possessed all the essential qualities of sunlight.\n\nThe garden was composed of weird plants and blossoms, many of which were exotic to Mars, and had perhaps been imported from the alien solar system to which Vulthoom was native. Some of the flowers were enormous mats of petals, like a hundred orchids joined into one. There were cruciform trees, hung with fantastically long and variegated leaves that resembled heraldic pennons or scrolls of cryptic writing; and others were branched and fruited in outlandish ways.\n\nBeyond the garden, they entered a world of open passages and chambered caverns, some of which were filled with machinery or with storage-vats and urns. In others, immense ingots of precious and semi-precious metals were piled, and gigantic coffers spilled their flashing gems as if to tempt the Earthmen.\n\nMost of the machines were in action, though intended, and Haines and Chanler were told that they could run in this manner for centuries or millenaries. Their operation was inexplicable even to Haines with his expert knowledge of mechanics. Vulthoom and his people had gone beyond the spectrum, and beyond the audible vibrations of sound, and had compelled the hidden forces of the universe to appear and obey them.\n\nEverywhere there was a loud beating as of metal pulses, a mutter as of prisoned Afrits and servile iron titans. Valves opened and shut with a harsh clangor. There were rooms pillared with strident dynamos; and others where groups of mysteriously levitated spheres were spinning silently, like suns and planets in the void of space.\n\nThey climbed a flight of stairs, colossal as the steps of the pyramid of Cheops, to a higher level. Haines, in a dream-like fashion, seemed to remember descending these stairs, and thought they were now nearing the chamber in which he and Chanler had been interviewed by the hidden entity, Vulthoom. lie was not sure, however; and Ta-Vho-Shai led them through a series of vast rooms that appeared to serve the purpose of laboratories. In most of these, there were age-old colossi, bending like alchemists over furnaces that burned with cold fire, and retorts that fumed with queer threads and ropes of vapor. One room was untenanted, and was furnished with no apparatus, other than three great bottles of clear, uncolored glass, taller than a tall man, and having somewhat the form of Roman amphoras. To all appearances the bottles were empty; but they were closed with double-handed stoppers that a human being could scarcely have lifted.\n\n\"What are these bottles?\" Chanler asked the guide.\n\n\"They are the Bottles of Sleep,\" said the Aihai, with the solemn and sententious air of a lecturer. \"Each of them is filled with a rare, invisible gas. When the time comes for the thousand-year slumber of Vulthoom, the gases are released; and mingling, they pervade the atmosphere of Ravormos, even to the lowest cavern, inducing sleep for a similar period in us who serve Vulthoom. Time no longer exists; and eons are no more than instants for the sleepers; and they awaken only at the hour of Vulthoom's awakening.\"\n\nHaines and Chanler, filled with curiosity, were prompted to ask many questions, but most of these were answered vaguely and ambiguously by Ta-Vho-Shai, who seemed eager to continue his ciceronage through other and ulterior parts of Ravormos. He could tell then nothing about the chemical nature of the gases; and Vulthoom himself, if the veracity of Ta-Vho-Shai could be trusted, was a mystery even to his own followers, most of whom had never beheld him in person.\n\nTa-Vho-Shai conducted the Earthmen from the room of bottles, and down a long straight cavern, wholly deserted, where a rumbling and pounding as of innumerable engines came to meet them. The sound broke upon them like a Niagara of evil thunders when they emerged finally in a sort of pillared gallery that surrounded a mile-wide gulf illumined by the terrible flaring of tongued fires that rose incessantly from its depths.\n\nIt was as if they looked down into some infernal circle of angry light and tortured shadow. Far beneath, they saw a colossal structure of curved and glittering girders, like the strangely articulated bones of a metal behemoth outstretched along the bottom of the pit. Around it, furnaces belched like the flaming mouths of dragons; tremendous cranes went up and down perpetually with a motion as of long-necked plesiosaurs; and the figures of giants, red as laboring demons, moved through the sinister glare.\n\n\"They build the ether-ship in which Vulthoom will voyage to the Earth,\" said Ta-Vho-Shai. \"When all is ready, the ship will blast its way to the surface by means of atomic disintegrators. The very stone will melt before it like vapor. Ignar-Luth, which lies directly above will be consumed as if the central fires of the planet had broken loose.\"\n\nHaines and Chanler, appalled, could offer no rejoinder. More and more they were stunned by the mystery and magnitude, the terror and menace, of this unsuspected cavern-world. Here, they felt, a malign power, armed with untold arcana of science, was plotting some baleful conquest; a doom that might involve the peopled worlds of the system was being incubated in secrecy and darkness. They, it seemed, were helpless to escape and give warning, and their own fate was shadowed by insoluble gloom.\n\nA gust of hot, metallic vapor, mounting from the abyss, burned corrosively in their nostrils as they peered from the gallery's verge. Ill and giddy, they drew back.\n\n\"What lies beyond this gulf?\" Chanler inquired, when his sickness had passed.\n\n\"This gallery leads to other caverns, little used, which conduct on the dry bed of an ancient underground river. This river-bed, running for many miles, emerges in a sunken desert far below sea-level, and lying to the west of Ignarh.\"\n\nThe Earthmen started at this information, which seemed to offer them a possible avenue of escape. Both, however, thought it well to dissemble their interest. Pretending fatigue, they asked the Aihai to lead them to some chamber in which they could rest awhile and discuss Vulthoom's proposition at leisure.\n\nTa-Vho-Shai, professing himself at their service in all ways, took them to a small room beyond the laboratories. It was a sort of bed-chamber, with two tiers of couches along the walls. These couches, from their length, were evidently designed tin accommodate the giant Martians. Here Haines and Chanler were left alone by Ta-Vho-Shai who had tacitly inferred that his presence was no longer needed.\n\n\"Well,\" said Chanler, \"it looks as if there were a chance of escape if we can only reach that river-bed. I took careful note of the corridors we followed on our return from the gallery. It should be easy enough—unless we are being watched without our knowledge.\"\n\n\"The only trouble is, it's too easy. But anyway, we can try. Anything would be better than waiting around like this. After what we've seen and heard, I'm beginning to believe that Vulthoom really is the Devil—even though he doesn't claim to be.\"\n\n\"Those ten-foot Aihais give me the creeps,\" said Chanler. \"I can readily believe they are a million years old, or thereabouts. Enormous longevity would account for their size and stature. Most animals that survive beyond the normal term of years become gigantic; and it stands to reason that these Martian men would develop in a similar fashion.\"\n\nIt was a simple matter to retrace their route to the pillared gallery that encircled the great abyss. For most of the distance, they had only to follow a main corridor: and the sound of the rumbling engineries alone would have guided them. They met no one in the passages; and the Aihais that they saw through open portals in laboratory rooms were deeply intent on enigmatic chemistries.\n\n\"I don't like this,\" muttered Haines. \"It's too good to be true.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure of that. Perhaps it simply hasn't occurred to Vulthoom and his followers that we might try to escape. After all, we know nothing about their psychology.\"\n\nKeeping close to the inner wall, behind the thick pillars, they followed the long, slowly winding gallery on the right hand. It was lit only by the shuddering reflection of the tall flames in the pit below. Moving thus, they were hidden from the view of the laboring giants, if any of these had happened to look upward. Poisonous vapors were blown toward them at intervals, and they felt the hellish heat of the furnaces; and the clangors of welding, the thunder of obscure machineries, beat upon them as they went with reverberations that were like hammer-blows.\n\nBy degrees they rounded the gulf, and came at last to its further side, where the gallery curved backward in its return toward the entrance corridor. Here, in the shadows, they discerned the unlit mouth of a large cavern that radiated from the gallery.\n\nThis cavern, they surmised, would lead them toward the sunken river-bed of which Ta-Vho-Shai had spoken. Haines, luckily, carried a small pocket-flash, and he turned its ray into the cavern, revealing a straight corridor with numerous minor intersections. Night and silence seemed to swallow them at a gulp, and the clangors of the toiling Titans were quickly and mysteriously muted as they hurried along the empty hall.\n\nThe roof of the corridor was fitted with metal hemispheres, now dark and rayless, that had formerly served to illuminate it in the same fashion as the other halls of Ravormos. A fine dust was stirred by the feet of the Earthmen as they fled; and soon the air grew chill and the losing the mild and somewhat humid warmth of the central caverns. It was plain, as Ta-Vho-Shai had told them, that these outer passages were seldom used or visited.\n\nIt seemed that they went on for a mile or more in that Tartarean corridor. Then the walls began to straiten, the floor roughened and fell steeply. There were no more cross-passages, and hope quickened in the Earthmen as they saw plainly that they had gone beyond the artificial caverns into a natural tunnel. The tunnel soon widened, and its floor became a series of shelf-formations. By means of these, they descended into a profound abyss that was obviously the river-channel of which Ta-Vho-Shai had told them.\n\nThe small flashlight barely sufficed to reveal the full extent of this underground waterway, in which there was no longer even a trickle of its pre-historic flood. The bottom, deeply eroded, and riffled with sharp boulders, was more than a hundred yards wide; and the roof arched into gloom irresoluble. Exploring the bottom tentatively for a little distance, Haines and Chanler determined by its gradual falling the direction in which the stream had flowed. Following this downwards course, they set out resolutely, praying that they would find no impassable barriers, no precipices of former cataracts to impede or prevent their egress in the desert. Apart from the danger of pursuit, they apprehended no other difficulties than these.\n\nThe obscure windings of the bottom brought them first to one side and then to the other as they groped along. In places the cavern widened, and they came to far-recessive beaches, terraced, and marked by the ebbing waters. High up on some of the beaches, there were singular formations resembling a type of mammoth fungi grown in caverns beneath the modern canals. These formations, in the shape of Herculean clubs, arose often to a height of three feet or more. Haines, impressed by their metallic sparkling beneath the light as he flashed it upon them, conceived a curious idea. Though Chanler protested against the delay, he climbed the shelving to examine a group of them more closely, and found, as he had suspected, that they were not living growths, but were petrified and heavily impregnated with minerals. He tried to break one of them loose, but it resisted all his tugging. However, by hammering it with a loose fragment of stone, he succeeded in fracturing the base of the club, and it toppled over with an iron tinkling. The thing was very heavy, with a mace-like swelling at the upper end, and would make a substantial weapon in case of need. He broke off a second club for Chandler; and thus armed, they resumed their flight.\n\nIt was impossible to calculate the distance that they covered. The channel turned and twisted, it pitched abruptly in places, and was often broken into ledges that glittered with alien ores or were stained with weirdly brilliant oxides of azure, vermilon and yellow. The men floundered ankle-deep in pits of sable sand, or climbed laboriously over damlike barricades of rusty boulders, huge as piled menhirs. Ever and anon, they found themselves listening feverishly for any sound that would betoken pursuit. But silence brimmed the Cimmerian channel, troubled only by the clatter and crunch of their own footsteps.\n\nAt last, with incredulous eyes, they saw before them the dawning of a pale light in the further depths. Arch by dismal arch, like the throat of Avernus lit by nether fires, the enormous cavern became visible. For one exultant moment, they thought that they were nearing the channel mouth; but the light grew with an eery and startling brilliance, like the flaming of furnaces rather than sunshine falling into a cave. Implacable, it crept along the walls and bottom and dimmed the ineffectual beam of Haines' torch as it fell on the dazzled Earthmen.\n\nOminous, incomprehensible, the light seemed to watch and threaten. They stood amazed and hesitant, not knowing whether to go on or retreat. Then, from the flaming air, a voice spoke as if in gentle reproof: the sweet, sonorous voice of Vulthoom.\n\n\"Go back as you came, O Earthlings. None may leave Ravormos without my knowledge or against my will. Behold! I have sent my Guardians to escort you.\n\nThe lit air had been empty to all seeming, and the river-bed was peopled only by the grotesque masses and squat shadows of boulders. Now, with the ceasing of the voice, Haines and Chanler saw before them, at a distance of ten feet, the instant apparition of two creatures that were comparable to nothing in the whole known zoology of Mars or Earth.\n\nThey rose from the rocky bottom to the height of giraffes, with shortish legs that were vaguely similar to those of Chinese dragons, and elongated spiral necks like the middle coils of great anacondas. Their heads were triple-faced, and they might have been the trimurti of some infernal world. It seemed that each face was eyeless, with tongue-shapen flames issuing voluminously from deep orbits beneath the slanted brows. Flames also poured in a ceaseless vomit from the gaping gargoyle mouths. From the head of each monster a triple comb of vermilion flared aloft in sharp serrations, glowing terribly; and both of them were bearded with crimson scrolls. Their necks and arching spines were fringed with sword-long blades that diminished into rows of daggers on the tapering tails; and their whole bodies, as well as this fearsome armament, appeared to burn as if they had just issued from a fiery furnace.\n\nA palpable heat emanated from these hellish chimeras, and the Earthmen retreated hastily before the flying splotches, like the blown tatters of a conflagration, that broke loose from their ever-jetting eye-flames and mouth-flames.\n\n\"My God These monsters are supernatural !\" cried Chanler, shaken and appalled.\n\nHaines, though palpably startled, was inclined to a more orthodox explanation. \"There must be some sort of television behind this,\" he maintained, \"though I can't imagine how it's possible to project three-dimensional images, and also create the sensation of heat... I had an idea, somehow, that our escape was being watched.\"\n\nHe picked up a heavy fragment of metallic stone and heaved it at one of the glowing chimeras. Aimed unerringly, the fragment struck the frontal brow of the monster, and seemed to explode in a shower of sparks at the moment of impact. The creature flared and swelled prodigiously, and a fiery hissing became audible. Haines and Chanler were driven back by a wave of scorching heat; and their wardens followed them pace by pace on the rough bottom. Abandoning all hope of escape, they returned toward Ravormos, dogged by the monsters as they toiled through yielding sand and over the ledges and riffles.\n\nReaching the point where they had descended into the river-channel they found its upper stretches guarded by two more of these terrific dragons. There was no other recourse than to climb the lofty shelves into the acclivitous tunnel. Weary with their long flight, and enervated by a dull despair, they found themselves again in the outer hall, with two of their guardians now preceding them like an escort of infernal honor. Both were stunned by a realization of the awful and mysterious powers of Vulthoom; and even Haines had become silent, though his brain was still busy with a futile and desperate probing. Chanler, more sensitive, suffered all the chills and terrors that his literary imagination could inflict upon him under the circumstances.\n\nThey came at length to the columned gallery that circled the vast abyss. Midway in this gallery, the chimeras who preceded the Earthmen turned upon them suddenly with a fearsome belching of flames; and, as they paused in their intimidation, the two behind continued to advance toward them with a hissing as of Satanic salamanders. In that narrowing space, the heat was like a furnace-blast, and the columns afforded no shelter. From the gulf below, where the Martian titans toiled perpetually, a stupefying thunder rose to assail them at the same time; and noxious fumes were blown toward them in writhing coils.\n\n\"Looks as if they are going to drive us into the gulf,\" Haines panted as he sought to draw breath in the fiery air. He and Chanler reeled before the looming monsters, and even as he spoke, two more of these hellish apparitions flamed into being at the gallery's verge, as if they had risen from the gulf to render impossible that fatal plunge which alone could have offered an escape from the others.\n\nHalf swooning, the Earthmen were dimly aware of a change in the menacing chimeras. The flaming bodies dulled and shrank and darkened the heat lessened, the fires died down in the mouths and eye-pits. At the same time, the creatures drew closer, fawning loathsomely, and revealing whitish tongues and eyeballs of jet.\n\nThe tongues seemed to divide... they grew paler... they were like flower-petals that Haines and Chanler had seen somewhere. The breath of the chimeras, like a soft gale, was upon the faces of the Earthmen... and the breath was a cool and spicy perfume that they had known before... the narcotic perfume that had overcome them following their audience with the hidden master of Ravormos... Moment by moment, the monsters turned to prodigious blossoms; the pillars of the gallery became gigantic trees in a glamor of primal dawn; the thunders of the pit were lulled to a far-off sighing as of gentle seas on Edenic shores. 'The teeming terrors of Ravormos, the threat of a shadowy doom, were as things that had never been. Haines and Chanler, oblivious, were lost in the paradise of the unknown drug...\n\nHaines, awakening darkly, found that he lay on the stone floor in the circling colonnade. He was alone, and the fiery chimeras had vanished. The shadows of his opiate swoon were roughly dissipated by the clangors that still mounted from the neighbouring gulf. With growing consternation and horror, he recalled everything that had happened.\n\nHe arose giddily to his feet, peering about in the semi-twilight of the gallery for some trace of his companion. The petrified fungus-club that Chanler had carried, as well as his own weapon, were lying where they had fallen from the fingers of the overpowered men. But Chanler was gone; and Haines shouted aloud with no other response than had eerily prolonged echoes of the deep arcade.\n\nImpelled by an urgent feeling that he must find Chanler without delay, he recovered his heavy mace and started along the gallery. It seemed that the weapon could be of little use against the preternatural servants of Vulthoom; but somehow, the metallic weight of the bludgeon reassured him.\n\nNearing the great corridor that ran to the core of Ravormos, Haines was overjoyed when he saw Chanler coming to meet him. Before he could call out a cheery greeting, he heard Chanler's voice:\n\n\"Hello, Bob, this is my first televisual appearance in tridimensional form. Pretty good, isn't it? I'm in the private laboratory of Vulthoom, and Vulthoom has persuaded me to accept his proposition. As soon as you've made up your mind to do likewise, we'll return to Ignarh with full instructions regarding our terrestrial mission, and funds amounting, to a million dollars each. Think it over, and you'll see that there's nothing else to do. When you've decided to join ins, follow the main corridor through Ravormos, and Ta-Vho-Shai will meet you and bring you into the laboratory.\"\n\nAt the conclusion of this astounding speech, the figure of Chanler, without seeming to wait for any reply from Haines, stepped lightly to the gallery's verge and floated out among the wreathing vapors. There, smiling upon Haines, it vanished like a phantom.\n\nTo say that Haines was thunderstruck would be putting it feebly indeed. In all verisimilitude, the figure and voice had been those of the flesh-and-blood Chanler. He felt an eery chill before the thaumaturgy of Vulthoom, which could bring about a projection so veridical as to deceive him in this manner. He was shocked and horrified beyond measure by Chanler's capitulation; but somehow, it did not occur to him that any imposture had been practised.\n\n\"That devil has gotten him,\" thought Haines. \"But I'd never have believed it. I didn't think he was that kind of a fellow at all.\"\n\nSorrow, anger, bafflement and amazement filled him alternately as he strode along the gallery; nor, as he entered the inner hall, was he able to decide on any clearly effective course of action. To yield, as Chanler had avowedly done, was unthinkably repugnant to him. If he could see Chanler again, perhaps he could persuade him to change his mind and resume an unflinching opposition to the alien entity. It was a degradation, and a treason to humankind, for any Earthman to lend himself to the more than doubtful schemes of Vulthoom. Apart from the projected invasion of Earth, and the spread of the strange, subtle narcotic, there was the ruthless destruction of Ignar-Luth that would occur when Vulthoom's ether-vessel should blast its way to the planet's surface It was his duty, and Chanler's, to prevent all this if prevention were humanly possible. Somehow, they—or he alone if necessary—must stem the cavern-incubated menace. Bluntly honest himself, there was no thought of temporizing even for an instant.\n\nStill carrying the mineraloid club, be strode on for several minutes, his brain preoccupied with the dire problem but powerless to arrive at any solution. Through a habit of observation more or less automatic with the veteran space-pilot, he peered through the doorways of the various rooms that he passed, where the cupels and retorts of a foreign chemistry were tended by age-old colossi. Then, without premeditation, he came to the deserted room in which were the three mighty receptacles that Ta-Vho-Shai had called the Bottles of Sleep. He remembered what the Aihai had said concerning their contents.\n\nIn a flash of desperate inspiration, Haines boldly entered the room hoping that he was not under the surveillance of Vulthoom at the moment. There was no time for reflection or other delay, if he were to execute the audacious plan that had occurred to him.\n\nTaller than his head, with the swelling contours of great amphoras and seemingly empty, the Bottles glimmered in the still light. Like the phantom of a bulbous giant, he saw his own distorted image in the upward-curving glass as he neared the foremost one.\n\nThere was but one thought, one resolution, in his mind. Whatever the cost, he must smash the Bottles, whose released gases would pervade Ravormos and plunge the followers of Vulthoom—if not Vulthoom himself—into a thousand-year term of slumber. He and Chanler, no doubt, would be doomed to share the slumber; and for them, unfortified by the secret elixir of immortality, there would be in all likelihood no awakening. But under the circumstances it was better so; and, by the sacrifice, a thousand years of grace would be accorded to the two planets. Now was his opportunity, and it seemed improbable that there would ever be another one.\n\nHe lifted the petrified fungus-mace, he swung it back in a swift arc, and struck with all his strength at the bellying glass. There was a gong-like clangor, sonorous and prolonged, and radiating cracks appeared from top to bottom of the huge receptacle. At the second blow, it broke inward with a shrill, appalling sound that was almost an articulate shriek, and Haines' face was fanned for an instant by a cool breath, gentle as a woman's sigh.\n\nHolding his breath to avoid the inhalation of the gas, he turned to the next Bottle. It shattered at the first stroke, and again he felt a soft sighing, that followed upon the cleavage.\n\nA voice of thunder seemed to fill the room as he raised his weapon to assail the third Bottle: \"Fool! you have doomed yourself and your fellow Earthman by this deed.\" The last words mingled with the crash of Haines' final stroke. A tomb-like silence followed, and the far-off, muted rumble of engineries seemed to ebb and recede before it. The Earthman stared for a moment at the riven Bottles, and then, dropping the useless remnant of his mace, which had been shattered into several fragments, he fled from the chamber.\n\nDrawn by the noise of breakage, a number of Aihais had appeared in the hall. They were running about in an aimless, unconcerted manner like mummies impelled by a failing galvanism. None of them tried to intercept the Earthman.\n\nWhether the slumber induced by the gases would be slow or swift in its coming, Haines could not surmise. The air of the caverns was unchanged as far as he could tell: there was no odor, no perceptible effect on his breathing. But already, as he ran, he felt a slight drowsiness, and a thin veil appeared to weave itself on all his senses. It seemed that faint vapors were forming in the corridor, and there was a touch of insubstantiality in the very walls.\n\nHis flight was without definite goal or purpose. Like a dreamer in a dream, he felt little surprise when he found himself lifted from the floor and borne along through mid-air in an inexplicable levitation. It was as if he were caught in a rushing stream, or were carried on invisible clouds. The doors of a hundred secret rooms, the mouths of a hundred mysterious halls, flew swiftly past him, and he saw in brief glimpses the colossi that lurched and nodded with the ever-spreading slumber as they went to and fro on strange errands. Then, dimly, he saw that he had entered the high-vaulted room that enshrined the fossil flower on its tripod of crystal and black metal. A door opened in the seamless stone of the further wall as he hurtled toward it. An instant more, while he seemed to fall downward through a nether chamber beyond, among prodigious masses of unnamable machines, upon a revolving disk that droned infernally; then he was deposited on his feet, with the whole chamber righting itself about him, and the disk towering before him. The disk had now ceased to revolve, but the air still throbbed with its hellish vibration. The place was like a mechanical nightmare, but amid its confusion of glittering coils and dynamos, Haines beheld the form of Chanler, lashed upright with metal cords to a rack-like frame. Near him, in a still and standing posture, was the giant Ta-Vho-Shai; and immediately in front of him, there reclined an incredible thing whose further portions and members wound away to an indefinite distance amid the machinery.\n\nSomehow, the thing was like a gigantic plant, with innumerable roots, pale and swollen, that ramified from a bulbular hole. This bole, half hidden from view, was topped with a vermilion cup like a monstrous blossom; and from the cup there grew an elfin figure, pearly-hued, and formed with exquisite beauty and symmetry; a figure that turned its Lilliputian face toward Haines and spoke in the sounding voice of Vulthoom:\n\n\"You have conquered for the time, but I bear no rancor toward you. I blame my own carelessness.\"\n\nTo Haines, the voice was like a far-off thunder heard by one who is half asleep. With halting effort, lurching as if he were about to fall, he made his way toward Chanler. Wan and haggard, with a look that puzzled Haines dimly, Chanler gazed upon him from the metal frame without speaking.\n\n\"I... smashed the Bottles,\" Haines heard his own voice with a feeling of drowsy unreality. \"It seemed the only thing to do... since you had gone over to Vulthoom.\"\n\n\"But I hadn't consented,\" Chanler replied slowly. \"It was all a deception... to trick you into consenting... And they were torturing me because I wouldn't give in.\" Chanler's voice trailed away, and it seemed that he could say no more. Subtly, the pain and haggardness began to fade from his features, as if erased by the gradual oncoming of slumber.\n\nHaines, laboriously trying to comprehend through his own drowsiness, perceived an evil-looking instrument, like a many-pointed metal goad, which drooped from the fingers of Ta-Vho-Shai. From the arc of needle-like tips, there fell a ceaseless torrent of electric sparks. The bosom of Chanler's shirt had been torn open, and his skin was stippled with tiny blue-black marks from chin to diaphragm—marks that formed a diabolic pattern. Haines felt a vague, unreal horror.\n\nThrough the Lethe that closed upon his senses more and more, he became aware that Vulthoom had spoken; and after an interval, it seemed that he understood the meaning of the words. \"All my methods of persuasion have failed; but it matters little. I shall yield myself to slumber, though I could remain awake if I wished, defying the gases through my superior science and vital power. We shall all sleep soundly... and a thousand years are no more than a single night to my followers and me. For you, whose life-term is so brief, they will become—eternity. Soon I shall awaken and resume my plans of conquest... and you, who dared to interfere, will lie beside me then as a little dust... and the dust will be swept away.\"\n\nThe voice ended, and it seemed that the elfin being began to nod in the monstrous vermilion cup. Haines and Chanler saw each other with growing, wavering dimness, as if through a gray mist that had risen between them. There was silence everywhere, as if the Tartarean engineries had fallen still, and the titans had ceased their labor, Chanler relaxed on the torture-frame, and his eyelids drooped. Haines tottered, fell, and lay motionless. Ta-Vho-Shai, still clutching his sinister instrument, reposed like a mummied giant. Slumber, like a silent sea, had filled the caverns of Ravormos.",

"在粗心的观察者眼中，鲍勃·海恩斯与保罗·塞普蒂默斯·钱勒除了同样身陷异星、囊空如洗的窘境外，似乎再难找到共同之处。\n\n海恩斯本是以太飞船的三副，因长官挟私报复，以违抗军令为由将他遗弃在火星商业大都会伊格纳尔——这座星际航线的枢纽港。他虽竭力寻觅新职，却始终未果。临别时领取的月薪，早被特勒里安酒店海盗般的房价吞噬殆尽。\n\n钱勒作为星际小说作家，本为夯实创作根基亲赴火星采风。不料盘缠数周告罄，而出版社允诺的汇款迟迟未至。\n\n除却厄运缠身，二人对火星万物皆怀有无尽好奇。正是这份对异域风情的渴求，对地球人避之不及之地的探索欲，让性情迥异的他们结为莫逆之交。\n\n为暂忘烦忧，他们整日游荡在雅汉运河东岸那片被火星人称作\"伊格纳-瓦兹\"的古老迷宫里。日暮归途，他们沿着紫罗兰大理石堤岸前行，眼看就要踏上那座通往现代都市伊格纳-鲁斯（地球领事馆与航运公司所在地）的千米长桥。\n\n此刻正值火星人的礼拜时辰。艾海族人在无顶神庙中聚集，祈求西沉的红日重返。无数铜钹的震颤声刺透稀薄大气，犹如发热金属的脉动。扭曲得不可思议的街巷空无一人，唯有几艘悬挂紫红菱形巨帆的驳船，在幽暗的绿波间缓缓穿行。\n\n伊格纳-鲁斯那些头重脚轻的塔楼与宝塔状金字塔背后，天光正以肉眼可见的速度消退。运河沿岸林立的日晷投下森然阴影，夜寒渐浓。伊格纳-瓦兹刺耳的钹声骤歇，留下诡谲的窃窃静默。这座亘古之城的建筑轮廓在墨绿天幕下显得格外庞大，冰晶般的星辰已缀满天穹。\n\n暮色中飘荡着难以名状的异香。这气息里藏着外星的神秘，令地球人既战栗又不安。临近长桥时，他们不约而同地沉默，感到四面八方涌来的诡异陌生感正随着渐浓的黑暗压迫而来。此刻比白昼更强烈地，他们感知到某种永远无法被异星子民理解的、隐秘而曲折的生命脉动。地球与火星间的虚空已被跨越，但地球人与火星人进化鸿沟间的天堑，又有谁能逾越？\n\n火星人以其沉默的方式展现着友好：他们容忍了地球人的闯入，允许星际贸易存在。地球学者们掌握了他们的语言，研究了他们的历史。但思想的真正交流似乎永无可能。早在利莫里亚沉没前，他们的文明就已历经复杂演变；其科学、艺术、宗教皆古老得难以想象；即便最简单的习俗，也是异星环境孕育的果实。\n\n此刻，面对自身处境的岌岌可危，海恩斯与钱勒对周围这个拥有无尽历史的未知世界，产生了真切的恐惧。\n\n他们加快脚步。运河边的宽阔步道看似空无一人，那座无栏杆的轻巧长桥仅由十尊火星英雄的巨型雕像守卫——它们以战斗姿态矗立在首段悬索桥的起点。\n\n当一道几乎与石像等高的活物身影从渐深的阴影中分离，迈着巨步逼近时，两个地球人着实吃了一惊。\n\n这身影足有十英尺高，比普通艾海族人还高出整整一码，却呈现出他们典型的身形特征：鼓胀的胸腔与多棱角的骨感四肢。高耸的招风耳与深陷的鼻孔在暮色中明显翕张，深陷眼窝中的双目完全不可见，唯有颅骨凹陷处悬浮着微小的猩红光点。依照当地习俗，这位怪人全身赤裸，但颈间那圈工艺奇特的银丝项圈表明他是某位贵族的仆役。\n\n海恩斯与钱勒震惊不已，他们从未见过如此魁梧的火星人。显然，这位不速之客意在拦截。他在无缝大理石路面上拦住二人去路。更令人惊异的是他那如同巨蛙鸣叫般低沉回荡的嗓音。尽管喉音浓重且某些元音含混不清，他们仍辨认出这是人类的语言。\n\n\"吾主召见尔等，\"巨人轰鸣道，\"尔等困境他已知晓。只要完成他所托之事，必得慷慨相助。随我来。\"\n\n\"好生霸道，\"海恩斯低语，\"去吗？或许是某位慈善的火星贵族听闻我等窘境。不知葫芦里卖的什么药？\"\n\n\"我建议跟去看看，\"钱勒热切地说，\"这开场白简直像惊悚小说的第一章。\"\n\n\"好吧，\"海恩斯对巨人喊道，\"带路。\"\n\n巨人调整步伐以适应地球人的步幅，领着他们离开英雄守卫的长桥，步入淹没伊格纳-瓦兹的紫绿色暮霭。步道尽头，一条小巷如巨口洞窟般在无光的宅邸与货仓间裂开——那些建筑的宽阔阳台与飞檐在半空中几乎相连。巷道空无一人，艾海族人如膨胀的阴影穿过黄昏，最终停在一处深邃高耸的门廊前。当钱勒与海恩斯紧随其后驻足时，一阵尖锐的金属摩擦声骤然响起——那扇门正如所有火星门户般，以中世纪吊闸的方式向上开启。\n\n向导的身影被圆形前厅墙顶镶嵌的放射性矿物灯映成剪影。依照习俗，他率先入内。跟进后，他们发现这个无窗的房间空无一人。身后的门扉在无可见操作的情况下自行闭合。\n\n钱勒环视这个密闭空间，突然涌起在封闭场所特有的莫名恐慌。虽无理由预感到危险或背叛，他却突然萌生强烈的逃脱冲动。\n\n海恩斯则困惑于内门紧闭与主人迟迟未现。不知为何，这宅邸给他无人居住之感，周遭寂静中透着空洞与荒芜。\n\n艾海族人站在空荡荡的房间中央转身面对地球人。他深陷眼窝中的目光莫测，咧开的嘴露出参差獠牙。但翕动的嘴唇并未发出人耳可闻的声音——他发出的必定是火星人特有的、超出人类听觉范围的高频音波。无疑，门闸机关正是由类似音波驱动。此刻，整个由无缝黑金属打造的地面开始缓缓下沉，仿佛坠入无底深坑。惊愕的海恩斯与钱勒看着头顶的橙黄灯光渐渐远去。他们与巨人一同坠入竖井的阴影中，金属摩擦的刺耳尖啸令人牙酸。\n\n头顶的灯光如渐远的黄色星群般微弱缩小。下坠持续着，在漆黑中他们已无法辨认彼此或艾海族人的面容。万千疑虑袭上心头，二人开始怀疑接受邀请是否过于轻率。\n\n\"带我们去哪儿？\"海恩斯直截了当，\"你主人住在地下？\"\n\n\"去见吾主，\"火星人给出谜般的终结回答，\"他正候着尔等。\"\n\n灯光已缩成单颗星辰，最终消逝在无尽的黑暗中。他们仿佛正坠向这个异星世界的核心，处境之诡谲令不安愈发强烈。他们已卷入一场开始显露凶险的迷局中。向导缄默不语，退路已断——何况他们手无寸铁。\n\n刺耳的金属尖啸渐缓，化作沉闷的嗡鸣。当竖井壁被一圈细柱取代时，猩红的光芒骤然刺入眼帘。强光中继续下坠片刻，地面终于静止。他们发现自己正置身于某个巨型洞窟，穹顶嵌满深红色半球体光源。这个圆形洞窟如轮轴般延伸出无数通道，许多与向导同样魁梧的火星人正穿梭其间，似在执行隐秘任务。隐藏机械发出的闷响与雷鸣般的震动在空气中颤抖，透过地面传来。\n\n\"我们这是到哪儿了？\"钱勒低语，\"肯定深入地底数英里。除了古艾海神话中的拉沃莫斯——传说邪神伏尔松在信徒环绕下千年长眠的火星地下世界——我从没听说过这种地方。\"\n\n向导听见了他的话：\"尔等已至拉沃莫斯，\"他发出不祥的轰鸣，\"伏尔松已醒，千年内不会再眠。正是他召见尔等。此刻便引尔等觐见。\"\n\n震惊至极的海恩斯与钱勒跟随火星人离开奇异的升降平台，迈向其中一条辐射状通道。\n\n“这必定是某种愚昧的迷信活动，”海恩斯低声道，“我也听说过伏尔图姆，但他不过是像撒旦那样的虚妄传说。如今开明的火星人早就不信这套了；虽然我听说贱民阶层里还流传着某种魔鬼崇拜。我敢打赌是某个贵族正策划推翻现任皇帝赛科尔的叛乱，把据点设在了地下。”\n\n“这倒说得通，”钱勒附和道，“革命者很可能自封为伏尔图姆：这种把戏很符合艾海人的心理。他们就喜欢浮夸的隐喻和怪诞的称号。”\n\n两人突然噤声，面对这延伸出无数发光走廊的巨穴世界，某种敬畏感油然而生。他们先前的推测开始显得苍白：难以置信之事已被证实，荒诞传说正化作现实，并将他们逐渐吞噬。远处神秘的铿锵声似乎来自超自然源头；那些扛着未知重物匆匆穿过厅堂的巨人，周身散发着诡秘而狂热的气息。海恩斯与钱勒虽都身材高大，但周围的火星人个个高达九到十英尺，有些甚至接近十一英尺，肌肉虬结的面容如木乃伊般古老，与他们的矫健身手形成诡异反差。\n\n在拱顶镶嵌着人造放射性金属红半球的地道里，那些如囚禁烈日般的红光间歇地倾泻而下。他们跟随领路的火星人跃下巨型阶梯，最终停在一间开凿于黑色玄武岩的密室门前。“进来。”对方说着侧身让路。\n\n密室狭高如尖塔，穹顶高处悬着的紫红光源将四壁染出血色。空荡的室内唯有一座固定在中央的黑色金属三脚架，托着块椭圆形水晶。水晶表面如冰封池塘般绽开一朵石花，光滑厚重的象牙色花瓣在异光中泛着玫瑰色晕，恍若雕塑组件。\n\n跨过门槛的瞬间，地球人立刻察觉到持续的地鸣与洞窟回声已陷入死寂，仿佛踏入被神秘屏障隔绝的圣所。身后的门依然敞着，向导已不知所踪。但他们无端感到暗处有视线从光秃墙壁上投来。\n\n不安的两人凝视着苍白石花，注意到七片舌状花瓣从穿孔的香炉状花心向外舒展。钱勒正怀疑这究竟是雕刻还是经过火星化学处理的真花时，一个清越动听的声音突然从花中响起——既非艾海人也非地球人的语调。\n\n“吾乃伏尔图姆。”那声音说道，“不必惊惶：吾欲与尔等结盟，只需应允一桩交易。首先须澄清尔等困惑之事。”\n\n“尔等所知传说半真半假。吾非神非魔，乃来自异宇宙之存在。虽非永生，寿命却远超太阳系生灵。吾遵循异界法则，沉睡与苏醒皆以世纪计。艾海人所信千年沉睡千年清醒之说基本属实。”\n\n“当尔等祖先尚与猿猴为伍时，吾遭死敌放逐至此。火星人称吾如烈焰流星坠天——那实为吾以太飞船。此处文明虽盛，较吾故土仍逊色甚多。”\n\n“此地统治者欲驱吾，吾遂以先进武器武装少数追随者。经大战后，吾退居此穴世界至今。为嘉其忠诚，吾赐予追随者近乎与吾同寿之生命，以及同步的沉睡周期。”\n\n“吾极少干涉地表居民。然彼辈将吾妖魔化——尽管邪恶对吾而言毫无意义。”\n\n“吾之感知可跨越时空。故知尔等困境，邀尔前来商议。简言之，吾已厌倦这垂死星球，欲迁居年轻地球。此刻追随者正建造新以太飞船。吾不愿重蹈初临火星时遭遇敌视之覆辙。尔等可替吾在地球铺路，召集信徒。报酬是长生药——以及尔等珍视的宝石金属。更有那花香...其魅惑之力远胜万物。嗅之即觉黄金粪土，甘愿效忠于吾。”\n\n余音震颤着听众的神经，如掺杂邪意的迷乐骤停，令海恩斯与钱勒的惊疑逐渐化作朦胧的接纳感。\n\n钱勒强自挣脱魅惑：“你在何处？如何证明所言非虚？”\n\n“吾近在咫尺。”声音答道，“眼前之花乃吾故乡化石，常温无味，遇热则发异香...尔等不妨自鉴。”\n\n密室气温骤升，热浪自三脚架水晶块辐射而来。同时一缕陌生甜香缠绕鼻端，渐次化作裹挟凉意的香料洪流。钱勒比海恩斯更强烈地陷入随之而来的幻境：蕨类森林拔地而起，珍珠色树干沐浴在伊甸晨光中。高耸花盏倾泻着令人战栗的浓香，他仿佛溯时光之源痛饮不朽青春。\n\n狂喜达到顶峰时，他听见花中传来天女般的歌声，将血液化作金浆。在感官的谵妄中，声与香浑然一体。整个世界在极乐中攀升，直至歌声凝成话语：“吾乃伏尔图姆，尔自太初便属吾，直至终末...”\n\n苏醒时他躺在古铜色卷曲草甸上，虎纹巨花垂首环伺，琥珀色夕照透过猩红果树的枝桠洒落。海恩斯的声音穿透梦境薄膜：“你总算醒了。”\n\n“我们在哪？怎么来的？”\n\n“据我看是地下花园。”海恩斯说，“我们被花香迷倒后，那些巨人把咱们搬到了这儿。伏尔图姆说给咱们四十八小时考虑。若答应，就送我们回伊格纳尔，还附赠大笔钱财和那些迷幻花。”\n\n彻底清醒后，两人讨论起这离奇处境：一个自称火星恶魔的未知存在，竟要他们当地球代理人推广邪教与成瘾性毒花。\n\n“要是拒绝呢？”\n\n“他说不可能放我们走。但没明说下场——只暗示会很糟糕。”\n\n“总得想办法脱身。”\n\n“恐怕难。我们可能在火星地下数英里处，而且电梯装置八成超出地球人的理解。”\n\n话音未落，一个艾海巨人捧着库尔派餐盘现身。这种火星餐具配有可拆卸杯盏与旋转酒瓶，能同时盛放固液态食物。地球人狼吞虎咽着几何形状的合成美食，痛饮深红酒液，而巨人如雕像般静立旁观。\n\n待他们用餐完毕，那位侍从首次开口：\n\"伏尔祇姆大人命汝等遍游拉沃莫斯，观览洞窟奇景。可自行探索，亦可由在下引路。吾名塔-弗霍-夏，凡有疑问必当解答。若欲遣退，随时皆可。\"\n\n海因斯与钱勒短暂商议后，决定接受向导服务。他们跟随艾海族穿过花园——琥珀色的雾霭中悬浮着发光微粒，使空间显得无边无际。塔-弗霍-夏解释道，这种类似阳光的光线源自洞顶与岩壁，由某种波长比宇宙射线更短的电磁力激发而生。\n\n园中遍布诡异植物，许多绝非火星原产，或许来自伏尔祇姆母星的异域星系。有些花朵如百株兰花融合成巨型花毯；十字形树木垂挂着纹章旗幡般的修长彩叶；更有枝干果实生长方式违背常理的奇种。\n\n穿过花园，他们步入甬道纵横的洞窟世界。某些洞室堆满运转的机械与储存罐，有些则陈列着贵金属锭与倾泻而出的宝石矿藏。这些机械即便无人操作亦能运转千载，其原理连精通力学的海因斯也无法参透。伏尔祇姆一族已掌控超越光谱与声波的宇宙秘力。\n\n金属脉动般的轰鸣无处不在，仿佛囚禁的巨灵与奴役的铁巨人正在低语。他们攀上堪比胡夫金字塔的巨阶，来到高层实验室。白发苍苍的巨人们如炼金术士般俯身冷焰炉灶，蒸馏器蒸腾着诡谲烟缕。某间空室仅陈列三只高过常人的无色玻璃瓶，瓶口密封着人力难移的双柄塞。\n\n\"此乃沉眠之瓶，\"艾海族向导肃然道，\"内藏无形之气。待伏尔祇姆千年休眠之时，气体释放将令全城生灵同坠长眠。对沉睡者而言，永恒不过弹指。\"\n\n尽管满腹疑问，多数问题只得到含糊其辞的回答。塔-弗霍-夏带领他们穿过荒芜长廊，最终抵达环绕着无底深渊的柱廊。下方炼狱般的火光中，巨型金属骨架如洪荒巨兽匍匐，赤红如恶魔的巨影在邪光中穿梭。\n\n\"他们在建造伏尔祇姆前往地球的以太飞船，\"向导宣告，\"竣工之日，原子分解炮将熔岩开道，正上方的伊格纳尔-卢斯城将如地心烈焰般灰飞烟灭。\"\n\n灼热的金属蒸汽灼烧着两位地球人的鼻腔。当钱勒询问深渊彼端，向导透露这条古老河床通往海平面下的沉没沙漠。这个讯息点燃了逃亡的希望。\n\n假装疲惫的探险者们被安置在实验室后方的小室。待向导离去，钱勒低语：\"若能抵达河床就有生机。那些实验室里的艾海族根本无暇他顾。\"\n\n重返环绕深渊的柱廊出奇顺利。借着下方火光掩护，他们沿右侧阴影潜行。焊接的铿锵与机械雷鸣中，他们终于发现通往河床的黑暗洞口。海因斯掏出手电筒，光束刺入死寂的甬道——这里布满灰尘，寒气逼人，与中央洞窟的湿润温暖截然不同。正如向导所言，此处早已被世人遗忘。\n\n他们仿佛在那塔尔塔罗斯般的甬道中跋涉了一英里有余。石壁开始收窄，地面变得崎岖陡峭。当发现人工洞窟已彻底被天然隧洞取代时，地球人心中重新燃起希望。隧洞很快变得开阔，岩层形成阶梯状的平台。借助这些天然阶梯，他们下潜至幽邃的深渊——显然这就是塔-沃-夏伊曾提及的古河道。\n\n手电筒微弱的光晕几乎照不全这条干涸水道的全貌，史前洪流在此处连涓滴细流都未残留。被严重侵蚀的河床布满锋利砾石，宽度逾百码；穹顶则隐没在无法穿透的幽暗中。海恩斯与钱德勒试探性地探查河床走向，根据逐渐倾斜的地势判断出古河流向。他们毅然循着下坡路前进，祈祷前方不会出现无法逾越的险阻，或是远古瀑布形成的断崖阻碍他们通往沙漠的归途。除追兵威胁外，这便是他们唯二担忧的困境。\n\n曲折的河床迫使他们在摸索中左右迂回。某些地段洞窟豁然开朗，露出退水形成的阶梯状滩涂。高处的滩涂上矗立着形似巨型真菌的奇异构造，与现代运河下方洞穴中的菌类如出一辙。这些赫拉克勒斯棍棒般的石笋常达三英尺以上。当手电光扫过时，海恩斯被其金属般的反光所震撼，萌生古怪念头。他不顾钱德勒反对，攀上斜坡近距离观察，证实了猜想：这些并非活体，而是矿化严重的化石。他用碎石敲击棍棒基部，随着金属般的脆响，这件顶端呈狼牙棒状的沉重武器应声倒地。他又为钱德勒如法炮制了第二件武器，两人持械继续逃亡。\n\n蜿蜒的河道使距离估算成为徒劳。这条时而急转直下、时而断层林立的通道里，异星矿脉闪烁着妖异光芒，蓝靛、朱红与明黄的氧化物如脓疮般侵蚀岩壁。他们时而深陷黑沙坑，时而翻越锈蚀巨岩堆成的堤坝。不时驻足凝神细听，却只有自己的脚步声在冥河般的甬道中回响。\n\n终于，难以置信的微光在前方深渊中浮现。如同被冥火照亮的阿维尔努斯咽喉，阴森的拱廊逐一亮起。他们一度狂喜地以为接近出口，但那诡谲的光芒却如熔炉烈焰般愈发明亮。可怖的光潮吞没了手电筒的微光，将惊愕的探险者笼罩在无可逃避的监视之下。\n\n\"退回去吧，地球之子。\"伏尔愚空灵的声音突然响起，\"未经许可者永不得离开拉沃莫斯。\"话音未落，两只超出火星与地球生物图鉴的怪物凭空显现。\n\n它们有着中国龙般的短肢与森蚺似的螺旋长颈，三张面孔如同地狱三相神的化身。倾斜眉骨下的眼窝喷涌着舌状火焰，石像鬼般的巨口不断呕出火流。猩红冠冕在头顶锯齿状耸立，深红卷须构成胡须，剑刃般的鳞甲沿脊柱延伸至渐细的尾部。这些刚从熔炉诞生的可怖存在散发着灼人热浪，迫使地球人连连后退。\n\n\"这些怪物是超自然的！\"钱德勒战栗惊呼。海恩斯却认为这是立体投影技术，他抄起金属矿石砸向怪物，却在火花迸溅中引发更猛烈的火焰喷发。被逼回拉沃莫斯的途中，他们发现上游河道已被另外两只炎龙封锁。\n\n精疲力竭的逃亡者重返圆柱回廊时，炎龙突然转身喷吐烈焰。前后夹击的绝境中，海恩斯发现钱德勒的石化菌棒与自己的武器都遗落在地。正当他绝望之际，钱德勒的幻象从蒸气中浮现：\"伏尔愚给了我三维投影的电视首秀。快来做客吧，完成任务我们每人能拿百万美金呢。\"说完便如幽灵般消散。\n\n海恩斯在回廊石板上独自醒来。拾起狼牙棒武器后，他撞见钱德勒的投影正推销着伏尔愚的条件：\"接受提议我们就能带着百万美金回伊格纳尔。\"幻影说完便微笑着没入雾气。震惊于同伴的叛变，海恩斯闯进那间存放\"沉眠之瓶\"的石室。在三只巨型双耳瓶的微光中，他看见自己扭曲的倒影——一个孤注一掷的计划正在成形。\n\n他心中唯有一个念头，一个决心。无论付出何种代价，都必须击碎那些玻璃瓶——瓶中释放的气体将弥漫拉沃莫斯，令沃鲁姆的信徒们（若非沃鲁姆本尊）陷入千年沉眠。毫无疑问，他与钱勒也将被迫共享这场长眠；而未经永生秘药强化的他们，极可能再无苏醒之日。但在此情势下，这已是更好的结局；通过这场牺牲，两颗星球将赢得千年的喘息之机。此刻正是他唯一的机会，往后恐怕再难觅得。\n\n他举起石化的真菌重锤，以迅疾弧线向后挥动，用尽全力砸向鼓胀的玻璃瓶。洪钟般的轰鸣声久久回荡，巨大的容器表面绽开蛛网般的裂痕。第二击落下时，伴随着近乎人声的尖锐爆响，瓶身向内爆裂，海恩斯的面颊霎时拂过一丝凉意，轻柔如女子的叹息。\n\n他屏息避开气体侵袭，转向下一个玻璃瓶。仅一击便将其粉碎，再度感受到那阵紧随碎裂声的轻柔吐息。\n\n当他举起武器攻击第三只瓶子时，雷霆般的声音响彻厅堂：\"蠢货！此举已注定你与地球同伴的毁灭。\"最后的话语与海恩斯致命一击的破碎声交织。墓穴般的寂静随之降临，远处机械的闷响仿佛在此寂静前退潮。地球人凝视着支离破碎的玻璃瓶，丢下已断成数截的残锤，仓皇逃离石室。\n\n碎裂声引来了众多艾海族人，他们如失效电流驱动的木乃伊般在厅中无序游走，无人阻拦逃亡者。\n\n气体引发的沉睡将缓慢降临抑或瞬息而至？海恩斯无从揣测。就他感知而言，洞窟中的空气毫无异样：既无气味，呼吸亦无阻滞。但奔跑中他已感到轻微困意，所有感官仿佛蒙上薄纱。走廊中似有稀薄雾气升腾，连石壁都透出虚幻质感。\n\n这场逃亡毫无目的。如同梦游者般，当发觉自己离地悬浮时竟不觉惊异。恍若卷入急流，又似乘无形云霭。无数密室门廊在身侧飞掠，惊鸿一瞥间，他看见那些执行诡异差事的巨像正随着蔓延的睡意踉跄颔首。朦胧中，他发现自己已置身拱顶高厅，水晶与黑金属三脚架上供奉着石化花朵。当他冲向无缝石墙时，远端竟洞开一扇门。瞬息间，他坠入下层空间，掠过无名机械群，落在一面发出地狱嗡鸣的旋转圆盘上；待他踉跄站定，整个厅堂已恢复常态，唯余静止的巨盘仍在散发邪异震颤。这机械噩梦般的场所里，钱勒被金属绳索绑在刑架上的身影格外醒目。静立一旁的巨人是塔-沃-沙伊，而正前方盘踞着难以名状之物——其肢体延伸至机械丛中，消失于视线尽头。\n\n那怪物状如巨型植物，无数苍白肿胀的根须从球茎孔洞中分叉蔓延。半隐半现的躯干顶端，猩红杯状物如畸形花朵绽放；花杯中升起珍珠色的小巧人形，以完美对称的精灵之姿转向海恩斯，发出沃鲁姆的轰响话音：\n\n\"你赢得了暂时的胜利，但我对你并无怨恨。只怪自己疏忽大意。\"\n\n这声音于海恩斯如同半梦半醒间听闻的远方雷鸣。他踉跄走向钱勒，后者在金属架上沉默凝视，憔悴面容中透着令他困惑的神情。\n\n\"我...打碎了玻璃瓶。\"海恩斯听见自己梦呓般的声音，\"这是唯一的选择...既然你已投靠沃鲁姆。\"\n\n\"但我从未同意。\"钱勒缓慢回应，\"全是骗局...为了诱你屈服...他们因我的抗拒施以酷刑。\"话音渐弱，痛苦神色随着渐浓的睡意从脸上褪去。\n\n昏沉中，海恩斯注意到塔-沃-沙伊手中垂下的多尖金属刺棒，针尖不断迸射电火花。钱勒敞开的衬衫下，从下颌到横膈膜布满蓝黑色斑点，排列成邪恶图案。一种虚幻的恐惧攫住了他。\n\n在逐渐吞噬神志的忘川之水中，他意识到沃鲁姆再度开口：\"所有劝诱手段皆告失败，但这无关紧要。我本可凭借高等科技与生命力抵抗气体保持清醒，却愿随众入眠...千年光阴于我和信徒不过弹指一瞬。而对生命短暂的你们，这将成为永恒。待我苏醒重拾征服大业时...胆敢阻挠者早已化为尘埃...终将被彻底抹除。\"\n\n话音消散，猩红花杯中的精灵人形开始颔首。海恩斯与钱勒隔着重纱般的灰雾对视，四周陷入死寂，仿佛冥府机械停转，泰坦巨人们也已歇工。钱勒在刑架上松弛下来，眼帘低垂。海恩斯踉跄倒地，塔-沃-沙伊仍攥着凶器，如巨形木乃伊般静止。沉默的睡意之海，已淹没拉沃莫斯的每处洞窟。"

        "content": "\n\nI had been out of work for several months, and my savings were perilously near the vanishing point. Therefore I was naturally elated when I received from John Carnby a favorable answer inviting me to present my qualifications in person. Carnby had advertised for a secretary, stipulating that all applicants must offer a preliminary statement of their capacities by letter; and I had written in response to the advertisement.\n\nCarnby, no doubt, was a scholarly recluse who felt averse to contact with a long waiting-list of strangers; and he had chosen this manner of weeding out beforehand many, if not all, of those who were ineligible. He had specified his requirements fully and succinctly, and these were of such nature as to bar even the average well-educated person. A knowledge of Arabic was necessary, among other things; and luckily I had acquired a certain degree of scholarship in this unusual tongue.\n\nI found the address, of whose location I had formed only a vague idea, at the end of a hilltop avenue in the suburbs of Oakland. It was a large, two-story house, overshaded by ancient oaks and dark with a mantling of unchecked ivy, among hedges of unpruned privet and shrubbery that had gone wild for many years. It was separated from its neighbors by a vacant, weed-grown lot on one side and a tangle of vines and trees on the other, surrounding the black ruins of a burnt mansion.\n\nEven apart from its air of long neglect, there was something drear and dismal about the place — something that inhered in the ivy-blurred oudines of the house, in the furtive, shadowy windows, and the very forms of the misshapen oaks and oddly sprawling shrubbery. Somehow, my elation became a trifle less exuberant, as I entered the grounds and followed an unswept path to the front door.\n\nWhen I found myself in the presence of John Carnby, my jubliation was still somewhat further diminished; though I could not have given a tangible reason for the premonitory chill, the dull, sombre feeling of alarm that I experienced, and the leaden sinking of my spirits. Perhaps it was the dark library in mhich he received me as much as the man himself — a room whose musty shadows could never have been wholly dissipated by sun or lamplight. Indeed, it must have been this; for John Carnby himself was very much the sort of person I had pictured him to be.\n\nHe had all the earmarks of the lonely scholar who has devoted patient years to some line of erudite research. He was thin and bent, with a massive forehead and a mane of grizzled hair; and the pallor of the library was on his hollow, clean-shaven cheeks. But coupled with this, there was a nerve-shattered air, a fearful shrinking that was more than the normal shyness of a recluse, and an unceasing apprehensiveness that betrayed itself in every glance of his dark-ringed, feverish eyes and every movement of his bony hands. In all likelihood his health had been seriously impaired by over-application; and I could not help but wonder at the nature of the studies that had made him a tremulous wreck But there was something about him — perhaps the width of his bowed shoulders and the bold aquilinity of his facial outlines — which gave the impression of great former strength and a vigor not yet wholly exhausted.\n\nHis voice was unexpectedly deep and sonorous.\n\n'I think you will do, Mr. Ogden,' he said, after a few formal questions, most of which related to my linguistic knowledge, and in particular my mastery of Arabic. 'Your labors will not be very heavy; but I want someone who can be on hand at any time required. Therefore you must live with me. I can give you a confortable room, and I guarantee that my cooking will not poison you. I often work at night; and I hope you will not find the irregular hours too disagreeable.'\n\nNo doubt I should have been overjoyed at this assurance that the secretarial position was to be mine. Instead, I was aware of a dim, unreasoning reluctance and an obscure forewarning of evil as I thanked John Carnby and told him that I was ready to move in whenever he desired. He appeared to be greatly pleased; and the queer apprehensiveness went out of his manner for a moment.\n\n'Come immediately — this very afternoon, if you can,' he said. 'I shall be very glad to have you and the sooner the better. I have been living entirely alone for some time; and I must confess that the solitude is beginning to pall upon me. Also, I have been retarded in my labors for lack of the proper help. My brother used to live with me and assist me, but he has gone away on a long trip.'\n\nI returned to my downtown lodgings, paid my rent with the last few dollars that remained to me, packed my belongings, and in less than an hour was back at my new employer's home. He assigned me a room on the second floor, which, though unaired and dusty, was more than luxurious in comparison with the hall-bedroom that failing funds had compelled me to inhabit for some time past. Then he took me to his own study, which was on the same floor, at the further end of the hall. Here, he explained to me, most of my future work would be done.\n\nI could hardly restrain an exclamation of surprise as I viewed the interior of this chamber. It was very much as I should have imagined the den of some old sorcerer to be. There were tables strewn with archaic instruments of doubtful use, with astrological charts, with skulls and alembics and crystals, with censers such as are used in the Catholic Church, and volumes bound in worm-eaten leather with verdigris-mottled clasps. In one corner stood the skeleton of a large ape; in another, a human skeleton; and overhead a stuffed crocodile was suspended.\n\nThere were cases overpiled with books, and even a cursory glance at the titles showed me that they formed a singularly comprehensive collection of ancient and modern works on demonology and the black arts. There were some weird paintings and etchings on the walls, dealing with kindred themes; and the whole atmosphere of the room exhaled a medley of half-forgotten superstitions. Ordinarily I would have smiled it confronted with such things; but somehow, in this lonely, dismal house, beside the neurotic, hag-ridden Carnby, it was difficult for me to repress an actual shudder.\n\nOn one of the tables, contrasting incongruously with this m êlange of medievalism and Satanism, there stood a typewriter, surmunded with piles of disorderly manuscript. At one end of the room there was a small, curtained alcove with a bed in which Carnby slept. At the end opposite the alcove, between the human and simian skeletons, I perceived a locked cupboard that was set in the wall.\n\nCarnby had noted my surprise, and was watching me with a keen, analytic expression which I found impossible to fathom. He began to speak, in explanatory tones.\n\n'I have made a life-study of demonism and sorcery,' he declared. 'It is a fascinating field, and one that is singularly neglected. I am now preparing a monograph, in which I am trying to correlate the magical practices and demon-worship of every known age and people. Your labors, at least for a whiIe, will consist in typing and arranging the voluminous preliminary notes which I have made, and in helping me to track down other references and correspondences. Your knowledge of Arabic will be invaluable to me, for I am none too well-grounded in this language myself, and I am depending for certain essential data on a copy of the Necronomicon in the original Arabic text. I have reason to think that there are certain omissions and erroneous renderings in the Latin version of Olaus Wormius.'\n\nI had heard of this rare, well-high fabulous volume, but had never seen it. The book was supposed to contain the ultimate secrets of evil and forbidden knowledge; and, moreover, the original text, written by the mad Arab, Abdul Alhazred, was said to be unprocurable. I wondered how it had come into Carnby's possession.\n\n'I'll show you the volume after dinner,' Carnby went on. 'You will doubtless be able to elucidate one or two passages that have long puzzled me.'\n\nThe evening meal, cooked and served by my employer himself, was a welcome change from cheap restaurant fare. Carnby seemed to have lost a good deal of his nervousness. He was very talkative, and even began to exhibit a certain scholarly gaiety after we had shared a bottle of mellow Sauterne. Still, with no manifest reason, I was troubled by intimations and forebodings which I could neither analyze nor trace to their rightful source.\n\nWe returned to the study, and Carnby brought out from a locked drawer the volume of which he had spoken. It was enormously old, and was bound in ebony covers arabesqued with silver and set with darkly glowing garnets. When I opened the yellowing pages, I drew back with involuntary revulsion at the odor which arose from them — an odor that was more than suggestive of physical decay, as if the book had lain among corpses in some forgotten graveyard and had taken on the taint of dissolution.\n\nCarnby's eyes were burning with a fevered light as he took the old manuscript from my hands and turned to a page near the middle. He indicated a certain passage with his lean forefinger.\n\n'Tell me what you make of this,' he said, in a tense, excited whisper.\n\nI deciphered the paragraph, slowly and with some difficulty, and wrote down a rough English version with the pad and pencil which Caraby offered me. Then, at his request, I read it aloud:\n\n'It is verily known by few, but is nevertheless no attestable fact, that the will of a dead sorcerer hath power upon his own body and can raise it up from the tomb and perform therewith whatever action was unfulfilled in life. And such resurrections are invariably for the doing of malevolent deeds and for the detriment of other's. Most readily can the corpse be animated if all its members have remained intact; and yet there are cases in which the excelling will of the wizard hath reared up from death the sundered pieces of a body hewn in many fragments, and hath caused them to serve his end, either separately or in a temporary reunion. But in every instance, after the action hath been completed, the body lapseth into its former state.'\n\nOf course, all this was errant gibberish. Probably it was the strange, unhealthy look of utter absorption with which my employer listened, more than that damnable passage from the Necronomicon, which caused my nervousness and made me start violently when, toward the end of my reading, I heard an indescribable slithering noise in the hall outside. But when I finished the paragraph and looked up at Carnby, I was more startled by the expression of stark, staring fear which his features had assumed — an expression as of one who is haunted by some hellish phantom. Somehow, I got the feeling that he was listening to that odd noise in the hallway rather than to my translation of Abdul Alhazred.\n\n'The house is full of rats,' he explained, as he caught my inquiring glance. 'I have never been able to get rid of them, with all my efforts.'\n\nThe noise, which still continued, was that which a rat might make in dragging some object slowly along the floor. It seemed to draw doser, to approach the door of Carnby's room, and then, after an intermission, it began to move again and receded. My employer's agitation was marked; he listened with fearful intentness and seemed to follow the progress of the sound with a terror that mounted as it drew near and decreased a little with its recession.\n\n'I am very nervous,' he said. 'I have worked too hard lately, and this is the result. Even a little noise upsets me.'\n\nThe sound had now died away somewhere in the house. Carnby appeared to recover himself in a measure.\n\n'Will you please re-read your translation?' he requested. 'I want to follow it very carefully, word by word.'\n\nI obeyed. He listened with the same look of unholy absorption as before, and this time we were not interrupted by any noises in the hallway. Carnby's face grew paler, as if the last remnant of blood had been drained from it, when I read the final sentences; and the fire in his hollow eyes was like phosphorescence in a deep vault.\n\n'That is a most remarkable passage,' he commented. 'I was doubtful about its meaning, with my imperfect Arabic; and I have found that the passage is wholly omitted in the Latin of Olaus Wormius. Thank you for your scholarly rendering. You have certainly cleared it up for me.'\n\nHis tone was dry and formal, as if he were repressing himself and holding back a world of unsurmisable thoughts and emotions. Somehow I felt that Carnby was more nervous and upset than ever, and also that my rendering from the Necronomicon had in some mysterious manner contributed to his perturbation. He wore a ghastly brooding expression, as if his mind were busy with some unwelcome and forbidden theme.\n\nHowever, seeming to collect himself, he asked me to translate another passage. This turned out to be a singular incantatory formula for the exorcism of the dead, with a ritual that involved the use of rare Arabian spices and the proper intoning of at least a hundred names of ghouls and demons. I copied it all out for Carnby, who studied it for a long time with a rapt eagerness that was more than scholarly.\n\n'That, too,' he observed, 'is not in Olaus Wormius.' After perusing it again, he folded the paper carefully and put it away in the same drawer from which he had taken the Necronomicon.\n\nThat evening was one of the strangest I have ever spent. As we sat for hour after hour discussing renditions from that unhallowed volume, I came to know more and more definitely that my employer was mortally afraid of something; that he dreaded being alone and was keeping me with him on this account rather than for any other reason. Always he seemed to be waiting and listening with a painful, tortured expectation, and I saw that he gave only a mechanical awareness to much that was said. Among the weird appurtenances of the room, in that atmosphere of unmanifested evil, of untold horror, the rational part of my mind began to succumb slowly to a recrudescence of dark ancestral fears. A scorner of such things in my normal moments. I was now ready to believe in the most baleful creations of superstitious fancy. No doubt, by some process of mental contagion, I had caught the hidden terror from which Carnby suffered.\n\nBy no word or syllable, however, did the man admit the actual feelings that were evident in his demeanor, but he spoke repeatedly of a nervous ailment. More than once, during our discussion, he sought to imply that his interest in the supernatural and the Satanic was wholly intellectual, that he, like myself, was without personal belief in such things. Yet I knew infallibly that his implications were false; that he was driven and obsessed by a real faith in all that he pretended to view with scientific detachment, and had doubtless been a victim to some imaginary horror entailed by his occult researches. But my intuition afforded me no clue to the actual nature of this horror.\n\nThere was no repetition of the sounds that had been so disturbing to my employer. We must have sat till after midnight with the writings of the mad Arab open before us. At last Carnby seemed to realize the lateness of the hour.\n\n'I fear I have kept you up too long,' he said apologetically. 'You must go and get some sleep. I am selfish, and I forget that such hours are not habitual to others, as they are to me.'\n\nI made the formal denial of his self-impeachment which courtesy required, said good night, and sought my own chamber with a feeling of intense relief. It seemed to me that I would leave behind me in Carnby's room all the shadowy fear and oppression to which I had been subjected.\n\nOnly one light was burning in the long passage. It was near Carnby's door; and my own door at the further end, close to the stair-head, was in deep shadow. As I groped for the knob, I heard a noise behind me, and turned to see in the gloom a small, indistinct body that sprang from the hall landing to the top stair, disappearing from view. I was horribly startled; for even in that vague, fleeting glimpse, the thing was much too pale for a rat and its form was not at all suggestive of an animal. I could not have sworn what it was, but the outlines had seemed unmentionably monstrous. I stood trembling violently in every limb, and heard on the stairs a singular bumping sound like the fall of an object rolling downward from step to step. The sound was repeated at regular intervals, and finally ceased.\n\nIf the safety of the soul and body had depended upon it, I could not have turned on the stair-light; nor could I have gone to the top steps to ascertain the agency of that unnatural bumping. Anyone else, it might seem, would have done this. Instead, after a moment of virtual petrification, I entered my room, locked the door, and went to bed in a turmoil of unresolved doubt and equivocal terror. I left the light burning; and I lay awake for hours, expecting momentarily a recurrence of that abominable sound. But the house was as silent as a morgue, and I heard nothing. At Iength, in spite of my anticipations to the contrary, I fell asleep and did not awaken till after many sodden, dreamless hours.\n\nIt was ten o'clock, as my watch informed me. I wondered whether my employer had left me undisturbed through thoughtfulness, or had not arisen himself. I dressed and went downstairs, to find him waiting at the breakfast table. He was paler and more tremulous than ever, as if he had slept badly.\n\n'I hope the rats didn't annoy you too much,' he remarked, after a preliminary greeting. 'Something really must be done about them.'\n\n'I didn't notice them at all,' I replied. Somehow, it was utterly impossible for me to mention the queer, ambiguous thing which I had seen and heard on retiring the night before. Doubtless I had been mistaken; doubtless it had been merely a rat after all, dragging something down the stairs. I tried to forget the hideously repeated noise and the momentary flash of unthinkable outlines in the gloom.\n\nMy employer eyed me with uncanny sharpness, as if he sought to penetrate my inmost mind. Breakfast was a dismal affair; and the day that followed was no less dreary. Carnby isolated himself till the middle of the afternoon, and I was left to my own devices in the well-supplied but conventional library downstairs. What Carnby was doing alone in his room I could not surmise; but I thought more than once that I heard the faint, monotonous intonations of a solemn voice. Horror-breeding hints and noisome intuitions invaded my brain. More and more the atmosphere of that house enveloped and stifled me with poisonous, miasmal mystery; and I felt everywhere the invisible brooding of malignant incubi.\n\nIt was almost a relief when my employer summoned me to his study. Entering, I noticed that the air was full of a pungent, aromatic smell and was touched by the vanishing coils of a blue vapor, as if from the burning of Oriental gums and spices in the church censors. An Ispahan rug had been moved from its position near the wall to the center of the room, but was not sufficient to cover entirely a curving violet mark that suggested the drawing of a magic circle on the floor. No doubt Carnby had been performing some sort of incantation; and I thought of the awesome formula I had translated at his request.\n\nHowever, he did not offer any explanation of what he had been doing. His manner had changed remarkably and was more controlled and confident than at any former time. In a fashion almost business-like he laid before me a pile of manuscript which he wanted me to type for him. The familiar click of the keys aided me somewhat in dismissing any apprehensions of vague evil, and I could almost smile at the recherché and terrific information comprised in my employer's notes, which dealt mainly with formulae for the acquisition of unlawful power. But still, beneath my reassurance, there was a vague, lingering disquietude.\n\nEvening came; and after our meal we returned again to the study. There was a tenseness in Carnby's manner now, as if he were eagerly awaiting the result of some hidden test. I went on with my work; but some of his emotion communicated itself to me, and ever and anon I caught myself in an attitude of strained listening.\n\nAt last, above the click of the keys, I heard the peculiar slithering in the hall. Carnby had heard it, too, and his confident look utterly vanished, giving place to the most pitiable fear.\n\nThe sound drew nearer and was followed by a dull, dragging noise, and then by more sounds of an unidentifiable slithering and scuttling nature that varied in loudness. The hall was seemingly full of them, as if a whole army of rats were hauling some carrion booty along the floor. And yet no rodent or number of rodents could have made such sounds, or could have moved anything so heavy as the object which came behind the rest. There was something in the character of those noises, something without name or definition, which caused a slowly creeping chill to invade my spine.\n\n'Good Lord! What is all that racket?' I cried.\n\n'The rats! I tell you it is only the rats!' Carnby's voice was a high, hysterical shriek.\n\nA moment later, there came an unmistakable knocking on the door, near the sill. At the same time I heard a heavy thudding in the locked cupboard at the further end of the room. Caraby had been standing erect, but now he sank limply into a chair. His features were ashen, and his look was almost maniacal with fright.\n\nThe nightmare doubt and tension became unbearable and I ran to the door and flung it open, in spite of a frantic remonstrance from my employer. I had no idea what I should find as I stepped across the sill into the dim-lit hall. When I looked down and saw the thing on which I had almost trodden, my feeling was one of sick amazement and actual nausea. It was a human hand which had been severed at the wrist — a bony, bluish hand like that of a week-old corpse, with garden-mold on the fingers and under the long nails. The damnable thing had moved! It had drawn back to avoid me, and was crawling along the passage somewhat in the manner of a crab. And following it with my gaze, I saw that there were other things beyond it, one of which I recognized as a man's foot and another as a forearm. I dared not look at the rest. All were moving slowly, hideously away in a charnel procession, and I cannot describe the fashion in which they moved. Their individual vitality horrifying beyond endurance. It was more than the vitality of life, yet the air was laden with a carrion taint. I averted my eyes and stepped back into Carnby's room, closing the door behind me with a shaking hand. Carnby was at my side with the key, which he turned in the lock with palsy-stricken fingers that had become as feeble as those of an old man.\n\n'You saw them?' he asked in a dry, quavering whisper.\n\n'In God's name, what does it all mean?' I cried.\n\nCarnby went back to his chair, tottering a little with weakness. His lineaments were agonized by the gnawing of some inward horror, and he shook visibly like an ague patient. I sat down in a chair beside him, and he began to stammer forth his unbelievable confession, half incoherently, with inconsequential mouthings and many breaks and pauses:\n\n'He is stronger than I am — even in death, even with his body dismernbered by the surgeon's knife and saw that I used. I thought he could not return after that — after I had buried the portions in a dozen different places, in the cellar, beneath the shrubs, at the foot of the ivy-vines. But the Necronomicon is right... and Helman Carnby knew it. He warned me before I killed him, he told me he could return -even in that condition.\n\n'But I did not believe him. I hated Helman, and he hated me, too. He had attained to higher power and knowledge and was more favored by the Dark Ones than I. That was why I killed him — my own twin-brother, and my brother in the service of Satan and of Those who were before Satan. We had studied together for many years. We had celebrated the Black Mass together and we were attended by the same familiars. But Helman Carnby had gone deeper into the occult, into the forbidden, where I could not follow him. I feared him, and I could not endure his supremacy.\n\n'It is more than a week — it is ten days since I did the deed. But Helman — or some part of him — has returned every night... God! His accursed hands crawling on the floor! His feet, his arms, the segments of his legs, climbing the stairs in some unmentionable way to haunt me! ... Christ! His awful, bloody torso lying in wait. I tell you, his hands have come even by day to tap and fumble at my door... and I have stumbled over his arms in the dark.\n\n'Oh, God! I shall go mad with the awfulness of it. But he wants me to go mad, he wants to torture me till my brain gives way. That is why he haunts me in this piece-meal fashion. He could end it all any time with the demoniacal power that is his. He could re-knit his sundered limbs and body and slay me as I slew him.\n\n'How carefully I buried the parts, with what infinite forethought! And how useless it was! I buried the saw and knife, too, at the farther end of the garden, as far away as possible from his evil, itching hands. But I did not bury the head with the other pieces — I kept it in that cupboard at the end of my room. Sometimes I have heard it moving there, as you heard it a little while ago... But he does not need the head, his will is elsewhere, and can work intelligently through all his members.\n\n'Of course, I locked all the doors and windows at night when I found that he was coming back... But it made no difference. And I have tried to exorcize him with the appropriate incantations — with all those that I knew. Today I tried that sovereign formula from the Necronomicon which you translated for me. I got you here to translate it. Also, I could no longer bear to be alone and I thought that it might help if there were someone else in the house. That formula was my last hope. I thought it would hold him — it is a most ancient and most dreadful incantation. But, as you have seen, it is useless...'\n\nHis voice trailed off in a broken mumble, and he sat staring before him with sightless, intolerable eyes in which I saw the beginning flare of madness. I could say nothing -the confession he had made was so ineffably atrocious. The moral shock, and the ghastly supernatural horror, had almost stupefied me. My sensibilities were stunned; and it was not till I had begun to recover that I felt the irresistible surge of a flood of loathing for the man beside me.\n\nI rose to my feet. The house had grown very silent, as if the macabre and charnel army of beleaguerment had now retired to its various graves. Carnby had left the key in the lock; and I went to the door and turned it quickly.\n\n'Are you leaving? Don't go,' Carnby begged in a voice that was tremulous with alarm, as I stood with my hand on the door-knob.\n\n'Yes, I am going,' I said coldly. 'I am resigning my position right now; and I intend to pack my belongings and leave your house with as little delay as possible.'\n\nI opened the door and went out, refusing to listen to the arguments and pleadings and protestations he had begun to babble. For the nonce, I preferred to face whatever might lurk in the gloomy passage, no matter how loathsome and terrifying, rather than endure any longer the society of John Carnby.\n\nThe hall was empty; but I shuddered with repulsion at the memory of what I had seen, as I hastened to my room. I think I should have screamed aloud at the least sound or movement in the shadows.\n\nI began to pack my valise with a feeling of the most frantic urgency and compulsion. It seemed to me that I could not escape soon enough from that house of abominable secrets, over which hung an atmosphere of smothering menace. I made mistakes in my haste, I stumbled over chairs, and my brain and fingers grew numb with a paralyzing dread.\n\nI had almost finished my task, when I heard the sound of slow measured footsteps coming up the stairs. I knew that it was not Carnby, for he had locked himself immediately in his room when I had left; and I felt sure that nothing could have tempted him to emerge. Anyway, he could hardly have gone downstairs without my hearing him.\n\nThe footsteps came to the top landing and went past my door along the hall, with that same dead monotonous repetition, regular as the movement of a machine. Certainly it was not the soft, nervous tread of John Carnby.\n\nWho, then, could it be? My blood stood still in my veins; I dared not finish the speculation that arose in my mind.\n\nThe steps paused; and I knew that they had reached the door of Carnby's room. There followed an interval in which I could scarcely breathe; and then I heard an awful crashing and shattering noise, and above it the soaring scream of a man in the uttermost extremity of fear.\n\nI was powerless to move, as if an unseen iron hand had reached forth to restrain me; and I have no idea how long I waited and listened. The scream had fallen away in a swift silence; and I heard nothing now, except a low, peculiar, recurrent sound which my brain refused to identify.\n\nIt was not my own volition, but a stronger will than mine, which drew me forth at last and impelled me down the hall to Carnby's study. I felt the presence of that will as an overpowering, superhuman thing — a demoniac force, a malign mesmerism.\n\nThe door of the study had been broken in and was hanging by one hinge. It was splintered as by the impact of more than mortal strength. A light was still burning in the room, and the unmentionable sound I had been hearing ceased as I neared the threshold. It was followed by an evil, utter stillness.\n\nAgain I paused, and could go no further. But, this time, it was something other than the hellish, all-pervading magnetism that petrified my limbs and arrested me before the sill. Peering into the room, in the narrow space that was framed by the doorway and lit by an unseen lamp, I saw one end of the Oriental rug, and the gruesome outlines of a monstrous, unmoving shadow that fell beyond it on the floor. Huge, elongated, misshapen, the shadow was seemingly cast by the arms and torso of a naked man who stooped forward with a surgeon's saw in his hand. Its monstrosity lay in this: though the shoulders, chest, abdomen and arms were all clearly distinguishable, the shadow was headless and appeared to terminate in an abruptly severed neck. It was impossible, considering the relative position, for the head to have been concealed from sight through any manner of foreshortening.\n\nI waited, powerless to enter or withdraw. The blood had flowed back upon my heart in an ice-thick tide, and thought was frozen in my brain. An interval of termless horror, and then, from the hidden end of Carnby's room, from the direction of the locked cupboard, there came a fearsome and violent crash, and the sound of splintering wood and whining hinges, followed by the sinister, dismal thud of an unknown object striking the floor.\n\nAgain there was silence — a silence as of consummated Evil brooding above its unnamable triumph. The shadow had not stirred. There was a hideous contemplation in its attitude, and the saw was still held in its poising hand, as if above a completed task.\n\nAnother interval, and then, without warning, I witnessed the awful and unexplainable disintegration of the shadow, which seemed to break gently and easily into many different shadows ere it faded from view. I hesitate to describe the manner, or specify the places, in which this singular disruption, this manifold cleavage, occurred. Simultaneously, I heard the muffled clatter of a metallic implement on the Persian rug, and a sound that was not that of a single body but of many bodies falling.\n\nOnce more there was silence — a silence as of some nocturnal cemetery, when grave-diggers and ghouls are done with their macabre toil, and the dead alone remain.\n\nDrawn by that baleful mesmerism, like a somnambulist led by an unseen demon, I entered the room, I knew with a loathly prescience the sight that awaited me beyond the sill -- the double heap of human segments, some of them fresh and bloody, and others already blue with beginning putrefaction and marked with earth-stains, that were mingled in abhorrent confusion on the rug.\n\nA reddened knife and saw were protruding from the pile; and a little to one side, between the rug and the open cupboard with its shattered door, there reposed a human head that was fronting the other remnants in an upright posture. It was in the same condition of incipient decay as the body to which it had belonged; but I swear that I saw the fading of a malignant exultation from its features as I entered. Even with the marks of corruption upon them, the lineaments bore a manifest likeness of John Carnby, and plainly they could belong only to a twin brother.\n\nThe frightful inferences that smothered my brain with their black and clammy cloud are not to be written here. The horror which I beheld — and the greater horror which I surmised — would have put to shame hell's foulest enormities in their frozen pits. There was but one mitigation and one mercy: I was compelled to gaze only for a few instants on that intolerable scene. Then, all at once, I felt that something had withdrawn from the room; the malign spell was broken, the overpowering volition that had held me captive was gone. It had released me now, even as it had released the dismembered corpse of Helman Carnby. I was free to go; and I fled from the ghastly chamber and ran headlong through an unlit house and into the outer darkness of the night.",

"我已失业数月，积蓄濒临枯竭。因此当收到约翰·卡恩比邀我面谈的复函时，自然欣喜若狂。卡恩比此前刊登招聘秘书的广告，要求应征者必须先以书面陈述资历——而我正是看到广告才去信的。\n\n这位学者无疑是个厌恶与陌生人周旋的隐士，故而用此法预先筛除不合格者。他在广告中详尽而简洁地列出要求，其严苛程度足以令普通受过高等教育者却步。除其他条件外，应聘者必须通晓阿拉伯语——所幸我对这门生僻语言恰好有所涉猎。\n\n我按地址寻至奥克兰郊区一条山顶街道的尽头，此处景象与我想象大相径庭。那是栋两层大宅，古橡树的浓荫笼罩着爬满野藤的黝黑外墙，未经修剪的水蜡树篱与荒芜多年的灌木丛将其包围。宅子两侧分别与杂草丛生的空地、缠绕着藤蔓的焦黑豪宅废墟为邻。\n\n即便抛开年久失修的迹象，这地方仍透着阴森——那些被藤蔓模糊的轮廓、鬼祟的幽暗窗扉、畸形橡树与古怪灌木的形态，无不散发着腐朽气息。当我踏入庭院，踩着无人打扫的小径走向正门时，原本的雀跃已消退几分。\n\n见到约翰·卡恩比本人时，我的欣喜更是一落千丈。某种难以名状的寒意攫住了我，那是种沉闷而不祥的警兆，令心情如灌铅般沉重。或许这份不安既源于他那间永远弥漫着霉味的幽暗书房，也源于其本人——不过他确实符合我对隐士学者的想象。\n\n这个将毕生奉献给冷门研究的孤独者瘦削佝偻，前额宽大，灰发蓬乱，剃净的脸颊凹陷苍白。但更引人注目的是他神经质的颤抖，那种远超学者腼腆的畏缩，以及从黑眼圈包围的狂热眼眸与骨节嶙峋的双手中不断流露出的惊惶。过度研究显然损害了他的健康，我不禁好奇是怎样的学问能将人摧残至此。不过从他佝偻却宽阔的肩膀、轮廓鲜明的鹰钩鼻来看，此人昔日必定体魄强健。\n\n他的嗓音意外地浑厚有力。\"我认为您能胜任，奥格登先生。\"在询问过我的语言能力（尤其是阿拉伯语水平）后他说道，\"工作并不繁重，但我需要随时待命的助手。您必须住在这里。我会提供舒适的房间，并保证我的厨艺不会毒害您。\"他补充说自己常在夜间工作，希望我不会介意作息紊乱。\n\n照理说我该为获得职位而狂喜，但致谢时却感到莫名的抗拒与隐约的凶兆。卡恩比显得极为满意，短暂的欣喜驱散了他惯常的焦虑。\"请立刻搬来——今天下午如何？\"他透露自己独居已久，坦言孤独开始令人窒息，而研究也因缺乏助手停滞不前。\"我兄弟曾协助我，但他已外出远行。\"\n\n我回到城中住所，用最后几美元结清房租，打包行李，不到一小时便重返雇主家中。他安排我住二楼一间积灰但还算宽敞的卧室——比贫窘时栖身的陋室强得多。随后他带我参观同层的书房，那将是主要工作场所。\n\n踏入书房的瞬间，我险些惊叫出声。这活脱是古代巫师的洞窟：桌上散落着用途可疑的古老仪器、占星图、颅骨、蒸馏器、水晶、天主教香炉，以及虫蛀皮革装帧、铜绿斑斑的典籍；角落矗立着巨猿与人类骨架；天花板上还悬着鳄鱼标本。\n\n书柜里塞满古今恶魔学著作，墙上挂着诡异画作，整个房间弥漫着陈腐的迷信气息。若在别处我或许会嗤之以鼻，但在这阴森的宅邸，面对神经质的卡恩比，我不禁打了个寒战。\n\n一台打字机突兀地置于中世纪遗物之间，旁边堆满杂乱手稿。书房尽头有张带帘幕的矮床，对面墙上的锁柜嵌在人类与猿猴骨架之间。\n\n卡恩比察觉我的震惊，用难以捉摸的审视目光打量我。\"我毕生研究恶魔学与巫术，\"他解释道，\"这是片被忽视的迷人领域。目前正在撰写论文，试图梳理各时代民族的魔法仪式与恶魔崇拜。您的工作是整理我的手稿，并协助查证资料。您的阿拉伯语将大有用处——\"他坦言自己对此语言造诣不深，而研究需要参照阿拉伯语原版的《死灵之书》，\"我认为奥劳斯·沃缪斯的拉丁译本存在疏漏。\"\n\n这部传说中的禁书据说记载了终极邪恶秘术，原著由疯诗人阿卜杜尔·阿尔哈兹莱德撰写，早已绝迹。我暗自诧异卡恩比如何获得。\n\n\"晚餐后给您看原本，\"他继续道，\"或许能帮我破解几处疑难段落。\"\n\n雇主亲手烹制的晚餐远比廉价餐馆可口。几杯醇厚的苏玳酒下肚，卡恩比神经质的举止缓和许多，甚至显出学者式的欢愉。然而莫名的忧虑仍萦绕在我心头。\n\n回到书房后，卡恩比从锁柜取出一部乌木封面镶嵌石榴石的古籍。泛黄书页散发出的腐臭——仿佛来自荒冢尸堆的溃败气息——令我本能地后退。\n\n卡恩比眼中燃起病态的炽热。他翻到书中段，用枯指按住某段文字：\"请翻译这个。\"我费力辨读后写下草稿，在他要求下朗读：\n\n\"鲜为人知却可证实者：死灵巫师之意志可驱策己尸，令其完成生前未竟之事。此类复活皆为行恶害人。肢体完整者最易复苏，然亦有术者凭卓绝意志，令碎尸残块各自或暂时聚合以遂其愿。然事成之后，尸身必复归原状。\"\n\n这自然是无稽之谈。但雇主全神贯注的癫狂神态，比《死灵之书》的内容更令我毛骨悚然。朗读至末段时，走廊突然传来诡异的摩擦声，惊得我浑身一震。抬头却见卡恩比脸上凝固着直面地狱恶灵般的恐惧——他似乎更在意那个声响而非译文。\n\n\"宅子里老鼠成灾，\"他捕捉到我的疑惑目光，\"想尽办法也除不尽。\"\n\n那声音像是拖拽重物的响动，时近时远。卡恩比随着声响逼近而战栗，随着远去稍缓。\"我近来神经衰弱，\"他解释，\"轻微响动就心神不宁。\"\n\n待声响彻底消失，他略微恢复镇定：\"请再读一遍译文，我要逐字推敲。\"\n\n我依言照办。他依旧带着那种亵渎的专注神情聆听，而这次走廊里再没有任何声响打断我们。当我念出最后几句时，坎比的面容变得惨白，仿佛最后一丝血色也被抽干；他那凹陷眼窝中的火光，宛如深窖里飘荡的磷火。\n\n\"这段文字着实非同寻常，\"他评价道，\"以我粗浅的阿拉伯语水平难以参透其意，而且我发现奥拉斯·沃尔缪斯的拉丁译本中完全删去了这段内容。感谢您专业的翻译，确实为我解惑了。\"\n\n他的语气干涩而刻板，仿佛正压抑着某种难以揣度的思绪与情感。不知为何，我感觉坎比如今比以往更加紧张不安，而我翻译的《死灵之书》段落似乎以某种诡秘方式加剧了他的焦虑。他脸上浮现出骇人的沉思表情，仿佛正被某个不受欢迎且禁忌的念头纠缠不休。\n\n不过他似乎强自镇定，又请我翻译另一段文字。这次的内容是驱遣亡者的奇异咒文，仪式涉及稀有阿拉伯香料的使用，以及准确吟诵至少上百个食尸鬼与恶魔的真名。我为坎比誊抄全文时，他如饥似渴地研读了许久，那种专注已远超学术研究的范畴。\n\n\"这段内容，\"他端详着纸张说道，\"同样不见于沃尔缪斯的译本。\"反复审阅后，他将纸张仔细折好，收进了取出《死灵之书》的那个抽屉。\n\n那晚是我经历过最诡异的夜晚之一。当我们连续数小时讨论这部邪典的译文时，我越来越确信我的雇主正被某种致命的恐惧所折磨——他害怕独处，这才是他留我作伴的真正原因。他始终带着痛苦而煎熬的期待神情侧耳倾听，我能看出他对谈话内容只是机械地回应。在这间充斥着诡异物品的房间里，在某种尚未显现的邪恶与难以言说的恐怖氛围中，我理智的部分逐渐被古老而黑暗的恐惧所侵蚀。平日对这些嗤之以鼻的我，此刻竟准备相信迷信幻想中最恶毒的造物。毫无疑问，通过某种精神感染的过程，我已沾染上坎比内心潜藏的恐惧。\n\n然而此人始终未用只言片语承认那些明显流露的情绪，只是反复提及神经衰弱。在我们讨论期间，他不止一次试图暗示自己对超自然与恶魔之事的兴趣纯粹出于学术，声称他和我一样并不真正信服这些。但我心知肚明这些说辞纯属谎言——他分明被某种真实信仰所驱使和困扰，却假装以科学态度对待，无疑已成为其神秘学研究招致的某种想象中恐怖的牺牲品。但我的直觉未能揭示这种恐怖的真实本质。\n\n再没有出现那些曾困扰我雇主的声响。我们摊开那阿拉伯疯子的著作对坐，想必已过午夜。最后坎比似乎意识到时候不早。\n\n\"恐怕耽误您太久了，\"他歉然道，\"您该去休息了。我太自私，忘了别人不像我习惯这样的作息。\"\n\n我礼节性地否认了他的自责，道过晚安便如释重负地回到自己房间。仿佛所有笼罩我的阴森恐惧都能被留在坎比房中。\n\n长廊里只亮着一盏灯。灯光靠近坎比的房门，而走廊尽头楼梯口旁我的房门则陷在浓影里。正当我摸索门把手时，身后传来响动——转身只见昏暗中一个模糊的小东西从楼梯平台窜上台阶，转瞬消失。我吓得魂不附体：即便在那惊鸿一瞥中，那东西也苍白得不似老鼠，轮廓更与任何动物毫不相似。我无法断言那是什么，但其形体轮廓可怖得难以名状。我四肢颤抖地站在原地，听见楼梯传来古怪的撞击声，仿佛有物体正一级级滚落。这声音以固定间隔重复着，最终归于寂静。\n\n即便事关灵魂与肉体的安危，我也无法鼓起勇气打开楼梯灯，更不敢登上台阶查看那不自然声响的来源。换作旁人或许会这么做。而我呆立片刻后，终究冲进房间锁上门，在未解的疑虑与暧昧的恐惧中和衣而卧。我亮着灯躺了数小时，时刻预期那可憎声响再度出现。但整栋房子如停尸间般死寂。最终，尽管自觉难以入眠，我还是沉入了无梦的昏睡。\n\n腕表显示已是十点。不知雇主是体贴地未加打扰，还是自己尚未起身。我穿戴整齐下楼，发现他正在早餐桌旁等候。他面色比往常更加苍白颤抖，仿佛彻夜未眠。\n\n\"希望老鼠没太打扰您，\"寒暄后他说道，\"真得想办法解决它们了。\"\n\n\"我完全没注意到，\"我回答。不知为何，我绝口未提昨夜所见所闻的诡异事物。想必是我弄错了——说到底不过是只老鼠拖着东西下楼梯罢了。我试图忘却那反复响起的骇人声响，以及昏暗中闪现的不可名状轮廓。\n\n雇主以异乎寻常的锐利目光审视我，仿佛要洞穿我的思想。早餐吃得索然无味，随后的一天同样沉闷。坎比独自闭门直到下午，我则在藏书丰富但平庸的楼下书房消磨时光。无从猜测他在房中做什么，但我不止一次听见隐约而单调的庄严吟诵声。滋生恐惧的暗示与恶毒的直觉侵蚀着我的大脑。这栋房子充满毒雾般的神秘氛围越来越令我窒息，仿佛到处都潜伏着无形的恶灵。\n\n当雇主召我去书房时，我几乎感到解脱。一进门就闻到刺鼻的芳香气息，蓝色烟缕正在消散，仿佛刚焚烧过东方树脂与香料。一块伊斯法罕地毯从墙边移到房间中央，却未能完全遮盖地板上魔法阵般的紫色弧线。显然坎比刚举行过某种咒术仪式，我不由想起应他要求翻译的那段可怕咒文。\n\n但他对方才所为未作解释。他的举止有了显著变化，比以往任何时候都更沉着自信。他以近乎公事公办的态度递给我一叠手稿要求誊打。熟悉的打字机键声多少驱散了些模糊的恐惧，我几乎能对雇主笔记中那些玄奥可怖的内容报以微笑——主要都是获取禁忌力量的咒文。然而在安心的表象下，仍有种隐约的不安挥之不去。\n\n夜幕降临，餐后我们重返书房。此刻坎比举止紧张，仿佛正急切等待某个隐秘试验的结果。我继续工作，但他的情绪感染了我，不时发现自己正竖起耳朵紧张倾听。\n\n终于，在打字声中我听见走廊传来奇特的滑行声。坎比也听见了，他脸上的自信荡然无存，取而代之的是最可怜的恐惧。\n\n那声音越来越近，伴随着沉闷的拖拽声，接着是更多难以辨识的窸窣爬行声，音量忽大忽小。整条走廊似乎都充斥着这些声响，仿佛成群老鼠正拖拽腐肉战利品。然而即便再多老鼠也不可能发出这种动静，更不可能拖动那跟在后面的沉重物体。这些声响中蕴含着某种无以名状的特质，令寒意顺着我的脊梁缓缓爬升。\n\n\"老天！那到底是什么动静？\"我喊道。\n\n\"老鼠！告诉你是老鼠！\"坎比的声音尖利得近乎歇斯底里。\n\n紧接着，门板底部传来清晰的敲击声。同时房间另一端上锁的橱柜里传出沉重撞击声。坎比原本站着，此刻却瘫软地跌进椅子。他面如死灰，惊恐得近乎癫狂。\n\n噩梦般的疑虑与紧张令人无法忍受，我不顾雇主疯狂阻拦冲到门前猛地拉开——尽管完全不知会在昏暗走廊里发现什么。当我低头看清差点踩到的东西时，只感到一阵恶心欲呕的惊骇。那是只齐腕切断的人手，骨节嶙峋，泛着青灰，像是死去一周的尸体，指缝与长指甲里嵌着泥土。这该死的东西居然在动！它正像螃蟹般沿走廊爬行，还向后缩以避开我。顺着它望去，我看见后方还有更多东西：能辨认出人脚与前臂，其余的我不敢细看。所有这些都在可怖地缓慢移动，如同送葬队列，其移动方式难以描述。每个部件都散发着超越忍受极限的恐怖生命力——那甚至超越了活体的生机，然而空气中却弥漫着腐臭。我移开视线退回房间，颤抖着关上门。坎比立刻用他那老人般无力的手哆嗦着锁上门。\n\n\"你看见了？\"他干涩地颤声问。\n\n\"看在上帝份上，这到底怎么回事？\"我喊道。\n\n坎比踉跄着跌回椅子，面容因内心恐惧的啃噬而扭曲，像疟疾病人般明显发抖。我在他身旁坐下，他开始断断续续地吐露那段难以置信的忏悔，语无伦次且充满无意义的嘟囔与停顿：\n\n\"他比我强大...即使死后，即使被我用外科刀锯分尸。我以为那样他就无法归来...我把残肢埋在十几个不同地方：地窖、灌木丛下、常春藤根旁。但《死灵之书》是对的...赫尔曼·坎比早就知道。他在我杀他前警告过，说他即便那样也能回来...\"\n\n\"但我不信。我恨赫尔曼，他也恨我。他获得了更高力量与知识，更受黑暗存在青睐。这就是我杀他的原因——我的孪生兄弟，同为撒旦及更古老存在效力的手足。我们共同研习多年，一起主持黑弥撒，共享使魔。但赫尔曼·坎比深入了我无法企及的禁忌领域。我畏惧他，无法忍受他的优越。\"\n\n\"那桩事已过去不止一周——整整十天了。可赫尔曼——或者说他的某部分——每晚都会归来...上帝啊！他那双该死的手在地板上爬行！他的脚、他的胳膊、断裂的腿节，以难以言喻的方式攀爬楼梯来纠缠我！...基督啊！他那血淋淋的可怖躯干埋伏在暗处。告诉你，白天里他的手指都会来叩门摸索...我在黑暗中绊倒在他的断臂上。\n\n\"噢，上帝！这般恐怖会逼疯我的。但他就是要我发疯，要折磨到我精神崩溃。所以他才会以这种零碎的方式纠缠我。凭借恶魔般的力量，他随时都能了结这一切。他本可以重组支离的肢体，像我杀死他那样杀死我。\n\n\"我埋藏尸块时多么谨慎，考虑得多么周全！可全都徒劳无功！我把锯子和刀子也埋在了花园最远端，离他那双邪恶发痒的手尽可能远。但头颅没和其他部件埋在一起——我把它藏在房间尽头的橱柜里。有时我听见它在里面蠕动，就像你方才听见的那样...可他不需要头颅，他的意志寄宿在别处，能通过所有残肢自如行动。\n\n\"发现他会回来后，我每晚都锁紧门窗...但毫无作用。我试过用所有知道的咒语来驱魔——今天还试了你帮我翻译的《死灵之书》里那个至高法咒。找你翻译就是为了这个。况且我再也无法独处，想着屋里多个人或许有用。那咒语是我最后的希望，本该能禁锢他——那是最古老最可怕的咒语。但如你所见，毫无效果......\"\n\n他的声音破碎成含糊的咕哝，呆坐着用那双空洞骇人的眼睛直视前方，我从中看到了疯狂的火苗。我无言以对——他的自白恐怖得难以言表。道德冲击与超自然的可怖几乎使我麻木。待知觉稍复，对身旁之人排山倒海的憎恶才席卷而来。\n\n我站起身。宅邸陷入死寂，仿佛围攻的尸骸大军已退回各自的坟墓。卡恩比将钥匙留在锁孔里，我快步上前转动门把。\n\n\"你要走？别走。\"当我手握门把时，卡恩比哀求道，声音因惊恐而颤抖。\n\n\"是的，这就走。\"我冷冰冰地说，\"即刻辞去职位。我会尽快收拾行李离开这鬼地方。\"\n\n推门而出时，我拒绝听他那些语无伦次的辩解与恳求。此刻我宁愿面对幽暗走廊里潜伏的任何东西——无论多么骇人——也不愿再与约翰·卡恩比共处一室。\n\n走廊空荡荡的，但奔向自己房间时，方才所见仍让我厌恶得发抖。阴影里稍有动静，我恐怕就会尖叫出声。\n\n收拾行李时，我被一种近乎疯狂的紧迫感驱使着。这座充满可怖秘密的宅邸弥漫着令人窒息的不祥，我只想尽快逃离。仓促中我磕绊着椅子，恐惧让大脑和手指都变得麻木。\n\n快要收拾完时，楼梯传来缓慢而有节奏的脚步声。不可能是卡恩比——我离开时他立刻锁死了房门，而且确信没什么能诱使他出来。无论如何他下楼我不可能听不见。\n\n脚步声抵达楼梯平台，经过我的房门沿着走廊远去，带着机械般精准的单调重复。这绝不是约翰·卡恩比那种紧张轻柔的步态。\n\n那会是谁？我的血液凝固了，不敢继续深想那个浮现在脑海的猜测。\n\n脚步声停住了——停在卡恩比房门前。接下来的寂静几乎令我窒息，而后传来可怕的碎裂声，夹杂着人类在极度恐惧中发出的凄厉尖叫。\n\n我僵立原地，仿佛被无形的铁手按住，不知呆立倾听了多久。尖叫很快归于沉寂，只剩下一种低沉的、诡异的、有规律的声响，我的大脑拒绝辨认那是什么。\n\n最终驱使我走向卡恩比书房的并非自己的意志，而是一种压倒性的、超人类的可怖存在——恶魔般的操控力，邪恶的催眠术。\n\n书房门被撞得只剩一个铰链挂着，像是被非人的力量击碎。屋内亮着灯，当我接近门槛时，那种难以名状的声响停止了，取而代之的是邪恶的绝对寂静。\n\n我又一次僵住了。这次让我在门槛前动弹不得的，不仅是那股地狱般的磁力。透过门框限定的狭窄视野，我看见东方地毯的一角，以及地板上投下的巨大静止阴影——畸形、拉长、无头，肩膀、胸膛、腹部和手臂清晰可辨，却终止于被斩断的脖颈。从相对位置来看，任何透视法都无法解释头颅的缺失。\n\n等待中，我的血液凝结成冰，思维冻结。在无尽的恐怖间隙后，锁着的橱柜方向传来骇人的碎裂声，接着是木板迸裂、铰链呻吟，最后是某物撞击地板的阴森闷响。\n\n再度降临的寂静中，阴影纹丝不动。它保持着可怖的沉思姿态，锯子仍悬在手中，仿佛刚完成某项工作。\n\n毫无预兆地，我目睹了阴影的诡异分解——它轻柔地分裂成诸多阴影后消散。我难以描述这种奇异崩解的具体方式与部位。与此同时，波斯地毯上传来金属工具的闷响，以及绝非单个躯体而是多个躯体坠落的声响。\n\n又是死寂——如同夜半坟场，掘墓人与食尸鬼结束劳作后，唯余亡者长眠。\n\n受那股邪恶魔力牵引，我如梦游者般踏入房间。怀着恶心的预感，我知道门槛后等着什么——混杂在地毯上的两堆人体残块，有的还鲜血淋漓，有的已开始腐败发青、沾着泥土。染血的刀锯从尸堆中探出，而在稍远处、地毯与被砸开的橱柜之间，端正摆放着一颗面向其他残肢的头颅。\n\n头颅与它所属的躯体同样处于腐败初期，但我发誓进门时看见它脸上恶毒的狂喜正在消退。尽管带着腐坏痕迹，那五官仍与约翰·卡恩比惊人相似——显然只能属于他的孪生兄弟。\n\n那些如黑色黏云般压迫我大脑的恐怖推论不便赘述。眼前所见——以及更可怕的猜测——足以令地狱最深处冻结的暴行相形见绌。唯有一丝慰藉：我只需忍受这难以直视的场景片刻。突然间，我感到某种存在离开了房间，邪恶咒缚解除，那股操控我的强大意志消散了。它释放了我，正如它释放了赫尔曼·卡恩比支离破碎的尸体。我自由了，冲出这间恐怖屋室，狂奔过漆黑的宅邸，没入外面深沉的夜色。"

        "content": "\n\nMany and multiform are the dim horrors of Earth, infesting her ways from the prime. They sleep beneath the unturned stone; they rise with the tree from its roots; they move beneath the sea and in subterranean places; they dwell in the inmost adyta; they emerge betimes from the shutten sepulcher of haughty bronze and the low grave that is sealed with clay. There be some that are long known to man, and others as yet unknown that abide the terrible latter days of their revealing. Those which are the most dreadful and the loathliest of all are haply still to be declared. But among those that have revealed themselves aforetime and have made manifest their veritable presence, there is one which may not openly be named for its exceeding foulness. It is that spawn which the hidden dweller in the vaults has begotten upon mortality.\n\nFrom the Necronomicon of Abdul Alhazred\n\nIn a sense, it is fortunate that the story I must now relate should be so largely a thing of undetermined shadows, of halfshaped hints and forbidden inferences. Otherwise, it could never be written by human hand or read by human eye. My own slight part in the hideous drama was limited to its last act; and to me its earlier scenes were merely a remote and ghastly legend. Yet, even so, the broken reflex of its unnatural horrors has crowded out in perspective the main events of normal life; has made them seem no more than frail gossamers, woven on the dark, windy verge of some unsealed abyss, some deep, half-open charnel, wherein Earth's nethermost corruptions lurk and fester. The legend of which I speak was familiar to me from childhood, as a theme of family whispers and head shakings, for Sir John Tremoth had been a schoolmate of my father. But I had never met Sir John, had never visited Tremoth Hall, till the time of those happenings which formed the final tragedy. My father had taken me from England to Canada when I was a small infant; he had prospered in Manitoba as an apiarist; and after his death the bee ranch had kept me too busy for years to execute a long-cherished dream of visiting my natal land and exploring its rural by-ways.\n\nWhen, finally, I set sail, the story was pretty dim in my memory; and Tremoth Hall was no conscious part of my itinerary when I began a motorcycle tour of the English counties. In any case, I should never have been drawn to the neighborhood out of morbid curiosity, such as the frightful tale might possibly have evoked in others. My visit, as it happened, was purely accidental. I had forgotten the exact location of the place, and did not even dream that I was in its vicinity. If I had known, it seems to me that I should have turned aside, in spite of the circumstances that impelled me to seek shelter, rather than intrude upon the almost demoniacal misery of its owner.\n\nWhen I came to Tremoth Hall, I had ridden all day, in early autumn, through a rolling countryside with leisurely, winding thoroughfares and lanes. The day had been fair, with skies of pale azure above noble parks that were tinged with the first amber and crimson of the following year. But toward the middle of the afternoon, a mist had come in from the hidden ocean across low hills and had closed me about with its moving phantom circle. Somehow, in that deceptive fog, I managed to lose my way, to miss the mile-post that would have given me my direction to the town where I had planned to spend the ensuing night.\n\nI went on for a while, at random, thinking that I should soon reach another crossroad. The way that I followed was little more than a rough lane and was singularly deserted. The fog had darkened and drawn closer, obliterating all horizons; but from what I could see of it, the country was one of heath and boulders, with no sign of cultivation. I topped a level ridge and went down a long, monotonous slope as the mist continued to thicken with twilight. I thought that I was riding toward the west; but before me, in the wan dusk, there was no faintest gleaming or flare of color to betoken the drowned sunset. A dank odor that was touched with salt, like the smell of sea marshes, came to meet me.\n\nThe road turned at a sharp angle, and I seemed to be riding between downs and marshland. The night gathered with an almost unnatural quickness, as if in haste to overtake me; and I began to feel a sort of dim concern and alarm, as if I had gone astray in regions that were more dubious than an English county. The fog and twilight seemed to withhold a silent landscape of chill, deathly, disquieting mystery.\n\nThen, to the left of my road and a little before me, I saw a light that somehow suggested a mournful and tear-dimmed eye. It shone among blurred, uncertain masses that were like trees from a ghostland wood. A nearer mass, as I approached it, was resolved into a small lodge-building, such as would guard the entrance of some estate. It was dark and apparently unoccupied. Pausing and peering, I saw the outlines of a wrought-iron gate in a hedge of untrimmed yew.\n\nIt all had a desolate and forbidding air; and I felt in my very marrow the brooding chillness that had come in from the unseen marsh in that dismal, ever-coiling fog. But the light was promise of human nearness on the lonely downs; and I might obtain shelter for the night, or at least find someone who could direct me to a town or inn.\n\nSomewhat to my surprise, the gate was unlocked. It swung inward with a rusty grating sound, as if it had not been opened for a long time; and pushing my motorcycle before me, I followed a weed-grown drive toward the light. The rambling mass of a large manor-house disclosed itself, among trees and shrubs whose artificial forms, like the hedge of ragged yew, were assuming a wilder grotesquery than they had received from the hand of the topiary.\n\nThe fog had turned into a bleak drizzle. Almost groping in the gloom, I found a dark door, at some distance from the window that gave forth the solitary light. In response to my thrice-repeated knock, I heard at length the muffled sound of slow, dragging footfalls. The door was opened with a gradualness that seemed to indicate caution or reluctance, and I saw before me an old man, bearing a lighted taper in his hand. His fingers trembled with palsy or decrepitude, and monstrous shadows flickered behind him in a dim hallway, and touched his wrinkled features as with the flitting of ominous, batlike wings.\n\n'What do you wish, sir?' he asked. The voice, though quavering and hesitant, was far from churlish and did not suggest the attitude of suspicion and downright inhospitality which I had begun to apprehend. However, I sensed a sort of irresolution or dubiety; and as the old man listened to my account of the circumstances that had led me to knock at that lonely door, I saw that he was scrutinizing me with a keenness that belied my first impression of extreme senility.\n\n'I knew you were a stranger in these parts,' he commented, when I had finished. 'But might I inquire your name, sir?'\n\n'I am Henry Chaldane.'\n\n'Are you not the son of Mr. Arthur Chaldane?'\n\nSomewhat mystified, I admitted the ascribed paternity.\n\n'You resemble your father, sir. Mr. Chaldane and Sir John Tremoth were great friends, in the days before your father went to Canada. Will you not come in, sir? This is Tremoth Hall. Sir John has not been in the habit of receiving guests for a long time; but I shall tell him that you are here; and it may be that he will wish to see you.'\n\nStartled, and not altogether agreeably surprised at the discovery of my whereabouts, I followed the old man to a booklined study whose furnishings bore evidence of luxury and neglect. Here he lit an oil lamp of antique fashion, with a dusty, painted shade, and left me alone with the dustier volumes and furniture.\n\nI felt a queer embarrassment, a sense of actual intrusion, as I waited in the wan yellow lamplight. There came back to me the details of the strange, horrific, half-forgotten story I had overheard from my father in childhood years.\n\nLady Agatha Tremoth, Sir John's wife, in the first year of their marriage, had become the victim of cataleptic seizures. The third seizure had apparently terminated in death, for she did not revive after the usual interval, and displayed all the familiar marks of the rigor mortis. Lady Agatha's body was placed in the family vaults, which were of almost fabulous age and extent, and had been excavated in the hill behind the manor-house. On the day following the interment, Sir John, troubled by a queer, insistent doubt as to the finality of the medical verdict, had reentered the vaults in time to hear a wild cry, and had found Lady Agatha sitting up in her coffin. The nailed lid was lying on the stone floor, and it seemed impossible that it could have been removed by the struggles of the frail woman. However, there was no other plausible explanation, though Lady Agatha herself could throw little light on the circumstances of her strange resurrection.\n\nHalf dazed, and almost delirious, in a state of dire terror that was easily understandable, she told an incoherent tale of her experience. She did not seem to remember struggling to free herself from the coffin, but was troubled mainly by recollections of a pale, hideous, unhuman face which she had seen in the gloom on awakening from her prolonged and deathlike sleep. It was the sight of this face, stooping over her as she lay in the open coffin, that had caused her to cry out so wildly. The thing had vanished before Sir John's approach, fleeing swiftly to the inner vaults; and she had formed only a vague idea of its bodily appearance. She thought, however, that it was large and white, and ran like an aoimal on all fours, though its limbs were semihuman.\n\nOf course, her tale was regarded as a sort of dream, or a figment of delirium induced by the awful shock of her experience, which had blotted out all recollection of its true terror. But the memory of the horrible face and figure had seemed to obsess her permanently, and was plainly fraught with associations of mind-unhinging fear. She did not recover from her illness, but lived on in a shattered condition of brain, and body; and nine months later she died, after giving birth to her first child.\n\nHer death was a merciful thing; for the child, it seemed, was one of those appalling monsters that sometimes appear in human families. The exact nature of its abnormality was not known, though frightful and divergent rumors had purported to emanate from the doctor, nurses and servants who had seen it. Some of the latter had left Tremoth Hall and had refused to reture, after a single glimpse of the monstrosity.\n\nAfter Lady Agatha's death, Sir John had withdrawn from society; and little or nothing was divulged in regard to his doings or the fate of the horrible infant. People said, however, that the child was kept in a locked room with iron-barred windows, which no one but Sir John himself ever entered. The tragedy had blighted his whole life, and he had become a recluse, living alone with one or two faithful servants, and allowing his estate to decline grievously through neglect. Doubtless, I thought, the old man who had admitted me was one of the remaining servitors. I was still reviewing the dreadful legend, still striving to recollect certain particulars that had almost passed from memory, when I heard the sound of footsteps which, from their slowness and feebleness, I took to be those of the returning manservant.\n\nHowever, I was mistaken; for the person who entered was plainly Sir John Tremoth himself. The tall, slightly bent figure, the face that was lined as if by the trickling of some corrosive acid, were marked with a dignity that seemed to triumph over the double ravages of mortal sorrow and illness. Somehow — though I could have calculated his real age — I had expected an old man; but he was scarcely beyond middle life. His cadaverous pallor and feeble tottering walk were those of a man who is stricken with some fatal malady. His manner, as he addressed me, was impeccably courteous and even gracious. But the voice was that of one to whom the ordinary relations and actions of life had long since become meaningless and perfunctory.\n\n\"Harper tells me that you are the son of my old school friend, Arthur Chaldane,\" he said. 'I bid you welcome to such poor hospitality as I am able to offer. I have not received guests for many years, and I fear you will find the Hall pretty dull and dismal and will think me an indifferent host. Nevertheless, you must remain, at least for the night. Harper has gone to prepare dinner for us.'\n\n'You are very kind,' I replied. 'I fear, however, that I am intruding. If — '\n\n'Not at all,' he countered firmly. 'You must be my guest. It is miles to the nearest inn, and the fog is changing into a heavy rain. Indeed, I am glad to have you. You must tell me all about your father and yourself at dinner. In the meanwhile, I'll try to find a room for you, if you'll come with me.' He led me to the second floor of the manor-house and down a long hall with beams and panels of ancient oak. We passed several doors which were doubtless those of bed-chambers. All were closed, and one of the doors was re-enforced with iron bars, heavy and sinister as those of a dungeon cell. Inevitably I surmised that this was the chamber in which the monstrous child had been confined, and also I wondered if the abnormality still lived, after a lapse of time that must have been nearly thirty years. How abysmal, how abhorrent, must have been its departure from the human type, to necessitate an immediate removal from the sight of others! And what characteristics of its further development could have rendered necessary the massive bars on an oaken door which, by itself, was strong enough to have resisted the assaults of any common man or beast?\n\nWithout even glancing at the door, my host went on, carrying a taper that scarcely shook in his feeble fingers. My curious reflections, as I followed him, were interrupted with nerve-shattering suddenness by a loud cry that seemed to issue from the barred room. The sound was a long, ever-mounting ululation, infra-bass at first like the tomb-muffled voice of a demon, and rising through abominable degrees to a shrill, ravenous fury, as if the demon had emerged by a series of underground steps to the open air. It was neither human nor bestial, it was wholly preternatural, hellish, macabre; and I shuddered with an insupportable eeriness, that still persisted when the demon voice, after reaching its culnunation, had returned by reverse degrees to a profound sepulchral silence.\n\nSir John had given no apparent heed to the awful sound, but had gone on with no more than his usual faltering. He had reached the end of the hall, and was pausing before the second chamber from the one with the sealed door.\n\n'I'll let you have this room,' he said. 'It's just beyond the one that I occupy.' He did not turn his face toward me as he spoke; and his voice was unnaturally toneless and restrained. I realized with another shudder that the chamber he had indicated as his own was adjacent to the room from which the frightful ululation had appeared to issue.\n\nThe chamber to which he now admitted me had manifestly not been used for years. The air was chill, stagnant, unwholesome, with an all-pervading mustiness; and the antique furniture had gathered the inevitable increment of dust and cobwebs. Sir John began to apologize.\n\n'I didn't realize the condition of the room,' he said. 'I'll send Harper after dinner, to do a little dusting and clearing, and put fresh linen on the bed.'\n\nI protested, rather vaguely, that there was no need for him to apologize. The unhuman loneliness and decay of the old manor-house, its lustrums and decades of neglect, and the corresponding desolation of its owner, had impressed me more painfully than ever. And I dared not speculate overmuch concerning the ghastly secret of the barred chamber, and the hellish howling that still echoed in my shaken nerves. Already I regretted the singular fortuity that had drawn me to that place of evil and festering shadows. I felt an urgent desire to leave, to continue my journey even in the face of the bleak autumnal rain and wind-blown darkness. But I could think of no excuse that would be sufficiently tangible and valid. Manifestly, there was nothing to do but remain.\n\nOur dinner was served in a dismal but stately room, by the old man whom Sir John had referred to as Harper. The meal was plain but substantial and well-cooked; and the service was impeccable. I had begun to infer that Harper was the only servant — a combination of valet, butler, housekeeper and chef.\n\nIn spite of my hunger, and the pains taken by my host to make me feel at ease, the meal was a solemn and almost funereal ceremony. I could not forget my father's story; and still less could I forget the sealed door and the baleful ululation. Whatever it was, the monstrosity still lived; and I felt a complex mingling of admiration, pity and horror as I looked at the gaunt and gallant face of Sir John Tremoth, and reflected upon the lifelong hell to which he had been condemned, and the apparent fortitude with which he had borne its unthinkable ordeals. A bottle of excellent sherry was brought in. Over this, we sat for an hour or more. Sir John spoke at some length concerning my father, of whose death he had not previously heard; and he drew me out in regard to my own affairs with the subtle adroitness of a polished man of the world. He said little about himself, and not even by hint or implication did he refer to the tragic history which I have outlined.\n\nSince I am rather abstemious, and did not empty my glass with much frequency, the major part of the heavy wine was consumed by my host. Toward the end, it seemed to bring out in him a curious vein of confidentiality; and he spoke for the first time of the ill health that was all too patent in his appearance. I learned that he was subject to that most painful form: of heart disease, angina pectoris, and had recently recovered from an attack of unusual severity.\n\n'The next one will finish me,' he said. 'And it may come at any time - perhaps tonight.' He made the announcement very simply, as if he were voicing a commonplace or venturing a prediction about the weather. Then, after a slight pause, he went on, with more emphasis and weightiness of tone:\n\n'Maybe you'll think me queer, but I have a fixed prejudice against burial or vault interment. I want my remains to be thoroughly cremated, and have left careful directions to that end. Harper will see to it that they are fulfilled. Fire is the cleanest and purest of the elements, and it cuts short all the damnable processes between death and ultimate disintegration. I can't bear the idea of some moldy, worm-infested tomb.'\n\nHe continued to discourse on the subject for some time, with a singular elaboration and tenseness of manner that showed it to be a familiar theme of thought, if not an actual obsession. It seemed to possess a morbid fascination for him; and there was a painful light in his hollow, haunted eyes, and a touch of rigidly subdued hysteria in his voice, as he spoke. I remembered the interment of Lady Agatha, and her tragic resurrection, and the dim, delirious horror of the vaults that had formed an inexplicable and vaguely disturbing part of her story. It was not hard to understand Sir John's aversion to burial; but I was far from suspecting the full terror and ghastliness on which his repugnance had been founded.\n\nHarper had disappeared after bringing the sherry; and I surmised that he had been given orders for the renovation of my room. We had now drained our last glasses; and my host had ended his peroration. The wind, which had animated him briefly, seemed to die out, and he looked more ill and haggard than ever. Pleading my own fatigue, I expressed a wish to retire; and he, with his invariable courtliness, insisted on seeing me to my chamber and making sure of my comfort, before seeking his own bed.\n\nIn the hall above, we met Harper, who was just descending from a flight of stairs that must have led to an attic or third floor. He was carrying a heavy iron pan, in which a few scraps of meat remained; and I caught an odor of pronounced gaminess, almost virtual putrescence, from the pan as he went by. I wondered if he had been feeding the unknown monstrosity, and if perhaps its food were supplied to it through a trap in the ceiling of the barred room. The surmise was reasonable enough, but the odor of the scraps, by a train of remote, half-literary association, had begun to suggest other surmises which, it would seem, were beyond the realm of possibility and reason. Certain evasive, incoherent hints appeared to point themselves suddenly to an atrocious and abhorrent whole. With imperfect success, I assured myself that the thing I had fancied was incredible to science; was a mere creation of superstitious diablerie. No, it could not be... here in England, of all places... that corpse-devouring demon of Oriental tales and legends, ... the ghoul.\n\nContrary to my fears, there was no repetition of the fiendish howling as we passed the secret room. But I thought that I heard a measured crunching, such as a large animal would make in devouring its food.\n\nMy room, though still drear and dismal enough, had been cleared of its accumulated dust and matted gossamers. After a personal inspection, Sir John left me and retired to his own chamber. I was struck by his deathly pallor and weakness, as he said good night to me, and felt guiltily apprehensive that the strain of receiving and entertaining a guest might have aggravated the dire disease from which he suffered. I seemed to detect actual pain and torment beneath his careful armor of urbanity, and wondered if the urbanity had not been maintained at an excessive cost.\n\nThe fatigue of my day-long journey, together with the heavy wine I had drunk, should have conduced to early slumber. But though I lay with tightly closed lids in the darkness, I could not dismiss those evil shadows, those black and charnel larvae, that swarmed upon me from the ancient house. Insufferable and forbidden things besieged me with filthy talons, brushed me with noisome coils, as I tossed through eternal hours and lay staring at the gray square of the storm-darkened window. The dripping of the rain, the sough and moan of the wind, resolved themselves to a dread mutter of half-articulate voices that plotted against my peace and whispered loathfully of nameless secrets in demonian language.\n\nAt length, after the seeming lapse of nocturnal centuries, the tempest died away, and I no longer heard the equivocal voices. The window lightened a little in the black wall; and the terrors of my night-long insomnia seemed to withdraw partially, but without bringing the surcease of slumber. I became aware of utter silence; and then, in the silence, of a queer, faint, disquieting sound whose cause and location baffled me for many minutes.\n\nThe sound was muffled and far off at times; then it seemed to draw near, as if it were in the next room. I began to identify it as a sort of scratching, such as would be made by the claws of an animal on solid woodwork. Sitting up in bed, and listening attentively, I realized with a fresh start of horror that it came from the direction of the barred chamber. It took on a strange resonance; then it became almost inaudible; and suddenly, for awhile, it ceased. In the interim, I heard a groan, like that of a man in great agony or terror. I could not mistake the source of the groan, which had issued from Sir John Tremoth's room; nor was I doubtful any longer as to the causation of the scratching.\n\nThe groan was not repeated; but the damnable clawing sound began again and was continued till day-break Then, as if the creature that had caused the noise were wholly nocturnal in its' habits, the faint, vibrant rasping ceased and was not resumed. In a state of dull, nightmarish apprehension, drugged with weariness and want of sleep, I had listened to it with intolerably straining ears. With its cessation, in the hueless, livid dawn, I slid into a deep slumber, from which the muffled and amorphous specters of the old Hall were unable to detain me any longer.\n\nI was awakened by a loud knocking on my door — a knocking in which even my sleep-confused senses could recognize the imperative and urgent. It must have been close upon midday; and feeling guilty at having overslept so egregiously, I ran to the door and opened it. The old manservant, Harper, was standing without, and his tremulous, grief-broken manner told me before he spoke that something of dire import had occurred.\n\n'I regret to tell you, Mr. Chaldane,' he quavered, 'that Sir John is dead. He did not answer my knock as usual; so I made bold to enter his room. He must have died early this morning.'\n\nInexpressibly shocked by his announcement, I recalled the single groan I had heard in the gray beginning of dawn. My host, perhaps, had been dying at that very moment. I recalled, too, the detestable nightmare scratching. Unavoidably, I wondered if the groan had been occasioned by fear as well as by physical pain. Had the strain and suspense of listening to that hideous sound brought on the final paroxysm of Sir John's malady? I could not be sure of the truth; but my brain seethed with awful and ghastly conjectures.\n\nWith the futile formalities that one employs on such occasions, I tried to condole with the aged servant, and offered him such assistance as I could in making the necessary arrangements for the disposition of his master's remains. Since there was no telephone in the house, I volunteered to find a doctor who would examine the body and sign the death certificate. The old man seemed to feel a singular relief and gratitude.\n\n'Thank you, sir,' he said fervently. Then, as if in explanation: 'I don't want to leave Sir John — I promised him that I'd keep a close watch over his body.' He went on to speak of Sir John's desire for cremation. It seemed that the baronet had left explicit directions for the building of a pyre of driftwood on the hill behind the Hall, the burning of his remains on this pyre, and the sowing of his ashes on the fields of the estate. These directions he had enjoined and empowered the servant to carry out as soon after death as possible. No one was to be present at the ceremony, except Harper and the hired pall bearers; and Sir John's nearer relatives - none of whom lived in the vicinity - were not to be informed of his demise till all was over.\n\nI refused Harper's offer to prepare my breakfast, telling him that I could obtain a meal in the neighboring village. There was a strange uneasiness in his manner; and I realized, with thoughts and emotions not to be specified in this narrative, that he was anxious to begin his promised vigil beside Sir John's corpse.\n\nIt would be tedious and unnecessary to detail the funereal afternoon that followed. The heavy sea fog had returned; and I seemed to grope my way through a sodden but unreal world as I sought the nearby town. I succeeded in locating a doctor and also in securing several men to build the pyre and act as pall bearers. I was met everywhere with an odd taciturnity, and no one seemed willing to comment on Sir John's death or to speak of the dark legendry that was attached to Tremoth Hall.\n\nHarper, to my amazement, had proposed that the cremation should take place at once. This, however, proved to be impracticable. When all the formalities and arrangements had been completed, the fog turned into a steady, everlasting downpour which rendered impossible the lighting of the pyre; and we were compelled to defer the ceremony. I had promised Harper that I should remain at the Hall till all was done; and so it was that I spent a second night beneath that roof of accurst and abominable secrets.\n\nThe darkness came on betimes. After a last visit to the village, in which I procured some sandwiches for Harper and myself in lieu of dinner, I returned to the lonely Hall. I was met by Harper on the stairs, as I ascended to the deathchamber. There was an increased agitation in his manner, as if something had happened to frighten him.\n\n'I wonder if you'd keep me company tonight, Mr. Chaldane,' he said. 'It's a gruesome watch that I'm asking you to share, and it may be a dangerous one. But Sir John would thank you, I am sure. If you have a weapon of any sort, it will be well to bring it with you.'\n\nIt was impossible to refuse his request, and I assented at once. I was unarmed; so Harper insisted on equipping me with an antique revolver, of which he himself carried the mate.\n\n'Look here, Harper,' I said bluntly, as we followed the hall to Sir John's chamber, 'what are you afraid of?'\n\nHe flinched visibly at the question and seemed unwilling to answer. Then, after a moment, he appeared to realize that frankness was necessary.\n\n'It's the thing in the barred room,' he explained. 'You must have heard it, sir. We've had the care of it, Sir John and I, these eight and twenty years; and we've always feared that it might break out. It never gave us much trouble — as long as we kept it well-fed. But for the last three nights, it has been scratching at the thick oaken wall of Sir John's chamber, which is something it never did before. Sir John thought it knew that he was going to die, and that it wanted to reach his body — being hungry for other food than we had given it. That's why we must guard him closely tonight, Mr. Chaldane. I pray to God that the wall will hold; but the thing keeps on clawing and clawing, like a demon; and I don't like the hollowness of the sound — as if the wall were getting pretty thin.'\n\nAppalled by this confirmation of my own most repugnant surmise, I could offer no rejoinder, since all comment would have been futile. With Harper's open avowal, the abnormality took on a darker and more encroaching shadow, a more potent and tyrannic menace. Willingly would I have foregone the promised vigil — but this, of course, it was impossible to do.\n\nThe bestial, diabolic scratching, louder and more frantic than before, assailed my ears as we passed the barred room. All too readily, I understood the nameless fear that had impelled the old man to request my company. The sound was inexpressibly alarming and nerve-sapping, with its grim, macabre insistence, its intimation of ghoulish hunger. It became even plainer, with a hideous, tearing vibrancy, when we entered the room of death.\n\nDuring the whole course of that funereal day, I had refrained from visiting this chamber, since I am lacking in the morbid curiosity which impels many to gaze upon the dead. So it was that I beheld my host for the second and last time. Fully dressed and prepared for the pyre, he lay on the chill white bed whose heavily figured, arraslike curtains had been drawn back. The room was lit by several tall tapers, arranged on a little table in curious brazen candelabras that were greened with antiquity; but the light seemed to afford only a doubtful, dolorous glimmering in the drear spaciousness and mortuary shadows.\n\nSomewhat against my will, I gazed on the dead features, and averted my eyes very hastily. I was prepared for the stony pallor and rigor, but not for the full betrayal of that hideous revulsion, that inhuman terror and horror, which must have corroded the man's heart through infernal years; and which, with almost superhuman control, he had masked from the casual beholder in life. The revelation was too painful, and I could not look at him again. In a sense, it seemed that he was not dead; that he was still listening with agonized attention to the dreadful sounds that might well have served to precipitate the final attack of his malady.\n\nThere were several chairs, dating, I think, like the bed itself, from the seventeenth century. Harper and I seated ourselves near the small table and between the deathbed and the paneled wall of blackish wood from which the ceaseless clawing sound appeared to issue. In tacit silence, with drawn and cocked revolvers, we began our ghastly vigil.\n\nAs we sat and waited, I was driven to picture the unnamed monstrosity; and formless or half-formed images of charnel nightmare pursued each other in chaotic succession through my mind. An atrocious curiosity, to which I should normally have been a stranger, prompted me to question Harper; but I was restrained by an even more powerful inhibition. On his part, the old man volunteered no information or comment whatever, but watched the wall with fear-bright eyes that did not seem to waver in his palsy-nodding head.\n\nIt would be impossible to convey the unnatural tension, the macabre suspense and baleful expectation of the hours that followed. The woodwork must have been of great thickness and hardness, such as would have defied the assaults of any normal creature equipped only with talons or teeth; but in spite of such obvious arguments as these, I thought momentarily to see it crumble inward. The scratching noise went on eternally; and to my febrile fancy, it grew sharper and nearer every instant. At recurrent intervals, I seemed to hear a low, eager, dog-like whining, such as a ravenous animal would make when it neared the goal of its burrowing.\n\nNeither of us had spoken of what we should do, in case the monster should attain its objective; but there seemed to be an unvoiced agreement. However, with a superstitiousness of which I should not have believed myself capable, I began to wonder if the monster possessed enough of humanity in its composition to be vulnerable to mere revolver bullets. To what extent would it display the traits of its unknown and fabulous paternity'? I tried to convince myself that such questions and wonderings were patently absurd; but was drawn to them again and again, as if by the allurement of some forbiddem gulf.\n\nThe night wore on, like the flowing of a dark, sluggish stream; and the tall, funeral tapers had burned to within an inch of their verdigris-eaten sockets. It was this circumstance alone that gave me an idea of the passage of time; for I seemed to be drowning in a black eternity, motionless beneath the crawling and seething of blind horrors. I had grown so accustomed to the clawing noise in the woodwork, and the sound had gone on so long, that I deemed its evergrowing sharpness and hollowness a mere hallucination; and so it was that the end of our vigil came without apparent warning.\n\nSuddenly, as I stared at the wall and listened with frozen fixity, I heard a harsh, splinteriag souod, and saw that a narrow strip had broken loose and was hanging from the panel. Then, before I could collect myself or credit the awful witness of my senses, a large semicircular portion of the wall collapsed in many splinters beneath the impact of some ponderous body.\n\nMercifully, perhaps, I have never been able to recall with any degree of distinctness the hellish thing that issued from the panel. The visual shock, by its own excess of horror, has almost blotted the details from memory. I have, however, the blurred impression of a huge, whitish, hairless and semi-quadruped body, of canine teeth in a half-human face, and long hyena nails at the end of forelimbs that were both arms and legs. A charnel stench preceded the apparition, like a breath from the den of some carrion-eating animal; and then, with a single nightmare leap, the thing was upon us.\n\nI heard the staccato crack of Harper's revolver, sharp and vengeful in the closed room; but there was only a rusty click from my own weapon. Perhaps the cartridge was too old; any rate, it had misfired. Before I could press the trigger again, I was hurled to the floor with terrific violence, striking my head against the heavy base of the little table. A black curtain, spangled with countless fires, appeared to fall upon me and to blot the room from sight. Then all the fires went out, and there was only darkness.\n\nAgain, slowly, I became conscious of flame and shadow; but the flame was bright and Qickering, and seemed to grow ever more brilliant. Then my dull, doubtful senses were sharply revived and clarified by the acrid odor of burning cloth. The features of the room returned to vision, and I found that I was lying huddled against the overthrown table, gazing toward the death-bed. The guttering candles had been hurled to the floor. One of them was eating a slow circle of fire in the carpet beside me; and another, spreading, had ignited the bed curtains, which were flaring swiftly upward to the great canopy. Even as I lay staring, huge, ruddy tatters of the burning fabric fell upon the bed in a dozen places, and the body of Sir John Tremoth was ringed about with starting flames.\n\nI staggered heavily to my feet, dazed and giddy with the fall that had hurled me into oblivion. The room was empty, except for the old manservant, who lay near the door, moaning indistinctly. The door itself stood open, as if someone — or something had gone out during my period of unconsciousness. I turned again to the bed, with some instinctive, halfformed intention of trying to extinguish the blaze. The flames were spreading rapidly, were leaping higher, but they were not swift enough to veil from my sickened eyes the hands and features — if one could any longer call them such — of that which had been Sir John Tremath. Of the last horror that had overtaken him, I must forbear explicit mention; and I would that I could likewise avoid the remembrance. All too tardily had the monster been frightened away by the fire...\n\nThere is little more to tell. Looking back once more, as I reeled from the smoke-laden room with Harper in my arms, I saw that the bed and its canopy had become a mass of mounting flames. The unhappy baronet had found in his own deathchamber the funeral pyre for which he had longed.\n\nIt was nearly dawn when we emerged from the doomed manor-house The rain had ceased, leaving a heaven lined with high and dead-gray clouds. The chill air appeared to revive the aged manservant, and he stood feebly beside me, uttering not a word, as we watched an ever-climbing spire of flame that broke from the somber-roof of Tremoth Hall and began to cast a sullen glare on the unkempt hedges.\n\nIn the combined light of the fireless dawn and the lurid conflagration, we both saw at our feet the semihuman, monstrous footprints, with their mark of long and canine nails, that had been trodden freshly and deeply in the rain-wet soil. They came from the direction of the manor-house, and ran toward the heath-clad hill that rose behind it.\n\nStill without speaking, we followed the steps. Almost without interruption, they led to the entrance of the ancient family vaults, to the heavy iron door in the hillside that had been closed for a full generation by Sir John Tremoth's order. The door itself swung open, and we saw that its rusty chain and lock had been shattered by a strength that was more than the strength of man or beast. Then, peering within, we saw the clay-touched outline of the unreturning footprints that went downward into mausolean darkness on the stairs.\n\nWe were both weaponless, having left our revolvers behind us in the death-chamber; but we did not hesitate long. Harper possessed a liberal supply of matches; and looking about, I found a heavy billet of water-soaked wood, which might serve in lieu of a cudgel In grim silence, with tacit determination, and forgetful of any danger, we conducted a thorough search of the well-nigh interminable vaults, striking match after match as we went on in the musty shadows.\n\nThe traces of ghoulish footsteps grew fainter as we followed them into those black recesses; and we found nothing anywhere but noisome dampness and undisturbed cobwebs and the countless coffins of the dead. The thing that we sought had vanished utterly, as if swallowed up by the subterranean walls.\n\nAt last we returned to the entrance. There, as we stood blinking in the full daylight, with gray and haggard faces, Harper spoke for the first time, saying in his slow, tremulous voice:\n\n'Many years ago — soon after Lady Agatha's death — Sir John and I searched the vaults from end to end; but we could find no trace of the thing we suspected. Now, as then, it is useless to seek. There are mysteries which, God helping, will never be fathomed. We know only that the offspring of the vaults has gone back to the vaults. There may it remain.'\n\nSilently, in my shaken heart, I echoed his last words and his wish.",

\n\n我茫然前行，以为很快会遇到岔路。所经之处近乎荒径，出奇地人迹罕至。雾气渐浓渐暗，吞噬了所有地平线；就目力所及，这片荒野遍布石楠与巨砾，毫无耕作痕迹。翻过平缓山脊后，我沿单调长坡下行，暮色中雾气愈发浓重。本以为正西行，但惨淡暮光里不见丝毫落日余晖。咸涩的沼泽气息裹挟着潮腥味扑面而来。  \n\n道路急转，我仿佛骑行于丘陵与湿地之间。夜幕以反常的速度降临，似要急迫地将我吞噬。朦胧的忧虑开始蔓延，仿佛迷失之地远比英格兰郡县更为诡谲。雾霭与暮色共同编织出一幅死寂、阴冷而令人不安的神秘图景。  \n\n忽然，左前方出现一点幽光，如泪眼般凄迷闪烁。它浮动在幽灵森林般的模糊轮廓间。靠近后辨出那是一座门房小屋，应是某处庄园入口。建筑漆黑无人。驻足凝视时，我望见未经修剪的紫杉篱笆中，一道锻铁大门的轮廓。  \n\n荒芜压抑的气息笼罩四周。骨髓深处都能感受到从无形沼泽渗入的阴寒，随永无止境翻涌的雾气侵入躯体。但那微光昭示着人烟，或许能求得一夜栖身，至少找到指路者。  \n\n铁门未锁。它向内开启时发出锈蚀的呻吟，仿佛多年未曾转动。推着摩托车沿杂草丛生的车道走向光源，一座蔓生的庄园主楼在林木间显现。那些人工修剪的灌木——如同参差不齐的紫杉篱——此刻呈现出比园艺雕琢更野性的怪诞姿态。  \n\n雾气化作凄冷细雨。昏暗中摸索许久，我才在孤灯窗户不远处找到一扇黑门。三度叩门后，终于听见拖沓脚步的闷响。门扉迟缓开启，仿佛带着迟疑。一位手持蜡烛的老者显现，颤抖的手指投下摇曳巨影，蝙蝠翅翼般的阴翳掠过他皱纹纵横的面容。  \n\n\"有何贵干，先生？\"他问道。嗓音虽发颤却无猜忌之意。然而我察觉某种犹豫。当他听罢我的迷途经历，那审视目光彻底颠覆了我对其老朽的初印象。  \n\n\"我知您是异乡人，\"他听完说道，\"敢问尊姓大名？\"  \n\n\"亨利·查尔丹。\"  \n\n\"可是亚瑟·查尔丹先生之子？\"  \n\n我困惑地承认。  \n\n\"您酷似令尊。查尔丹先生与约翰·特雷莫斯爵士曾是挚友，在他赴加前。请进吧，此处正是特雷莫斯庄园。爵士久不待客，但我会通报您的到来。\"  \n\n惊愕之余——这发现并不令人愉快——我随他进入藏书室。奢华却蒙尘的陈设间，他点燃一盏古旧油灯后离去。昏黄灯光下等待时，童年听闻的恐怖传说细节逐渐清晰：  \n\n阿加莎·特雷莫斯夫人——爵士之妻——新婚首年便罹患僵直症。第三次发作后被宣告死亡，因她未按常例苏醒且呈现尸僵特征。遗体安葬于庄园后山古老庞大的家族墓穴。下葬次日，爵士被诡异疑虑驱使重返墓穴，恰听见凄厉尖叫，发现夫人正从棺中坐起。钉死的棺盖落于石地，绝非孱弱妇人所能挣脱。  \n\n神志不清的夫人讲述着支离破碎的经历：她不记得挣脱过程，却对苏醒时在黑暗中瞥见的苍白非人面孔耿耿于怀——正是这张俯视她的怪脸引发惊叫。那东西在爵士赶到前逃往墓穴深处，她仅模糊记得其四肢半人半兽，苍白巨躯匍匐而行。  \n\n众人将叙述归为噩梦或创伤性谵妄。但可怖形象始终折磨着她，九个月后，她在诞下首胎后死去。  \n\n这实属仁慈——因那婴孩竟是人类家族偶现的骇人异形。虽流言纷杂，其确切畸形从未公开。部分仆役一瞥怪物后便拒绝返回。  \n\n爵士自此隐居，关于婴儿下落众说纷纭。据说孩子被囚于铁窗密室，唯爵士可入。这场悲剧摧毁了他，庄园亦随之荒废。引路老者想必是留守仆役之一。  \n\n正回忆时，迟缓脚步声再度响起。  \n\n来人却是约翰·特雷莫斯爵士本人。高大微驼的身影，蚀刻般皱纹密布的面容，都彰显着超越病痛与哀伤的尊严。他远未至暮年，但惨白面色与蹒跚步态已如绝症患者。  \n\n\"哈珀告知您是故友亚瑟·查尔丹之子，\"他无可挑剔的礼节中透着疏离，\"寒舍简陋，但请至少留宿一夜。\"  \n\n正欲婉拒时，走廊尽头突然爆发出非人嚎叫——初如地底恶魔的闷吼，渐升至撕心裂肺的尖啸，最后复归坟墓般的死寂。爵士却置若罔闻，继续引路。经过一道加固铁门的密室时，我猛然意识到：那畸变之子若存活至今，已近三十载。究竟何等可怖的异变，需要如此森严的禁锢？\n\n\"这间房就留给您了，\"他说道，始终没有转过脸来，声音里透着不自然的平板与克制。\"就在我卧室隔壁。\"当我意识到他所说的那间卧室紧邻着先前传出骇人嗥叫的房间时，又是一阵战栗窜上脊背。\n\n他引我进入的客房显然多年无人使用。凝滞的空气中弥漫着刺骨的寒意与腐朽的霉味，古旧家具上积满经年蛛网尘埃。约翰爵士开始致歉。\n\n\"没想到房间这般状况，\"他说，\"晚餐后我会派哈珀来打扫，再换上干净床品。\"\n\n我含糊地推辞着，心中却被这座古宅非人的孤寂与衰败刺痛。年复一年的荒弃与主人显而易见的颓唐，比那间上锁密室里的可怖嗥叫更令我毛骨悚然。此刻我无比懊悔偶然踏入这座被邪祟阴影侵蚀的宅邸，恨不能立即冒著秋雨连夜逃离。但苦于找不到体面的借口，只得留下。\n\n晚餐在阴森却庄严的餐厅进行，由那位被称作哈珀的老仆侍奉。菜肴简单却烹调得法，服务无可挑剔。我渐渐明白哈珀是宅邸唯一的仆人——身兼男仆、管家、厨师数职。\n\n尽管饥肠辘辘，尽管主人竭力营造轻松氛围，这顿饭仍吃得如同葬礼仪式。父亲讲述的往事、那扇密封门后传来的恶毒嗥叫在我脑中挥之不去。无论那怪物是什么，它依然存活于世。望着约翰·特里莫斯爵士枯槁而坚毅的面容，想到他终生背负的地狱诅咒与展现出的惊人耐力，我心中涌起混杂着敬佩、怜悯与恐惧的复杂情绪。\n\n一瓶上等雪莉酒被端上桌。我们浅酌慢饮了一个多钟头。爵士详细询问了先父——他刚得知其死讯——的情况，又以世故老练的话术探听我的境遇。关于他自己却只字不提，对我所知的那段悲剧历史更是讳莫如深。\n\n因我不善饮酒，整瓶烈酒多半进了主人腹中。酒过三巡，他竟流露出罕见的倾诉欲，首次谈及自己病态的面容所昭示的健康问题。我得知他患有最痛苦的心绞痛，最近才从一次严重发作中恢复。\n\n\"下次发作就会要了我的命，\"他平静得仿佛在谈论天气，\"也许就在今晚。\"稍作停顿后，他加重语气补充道：\"或许您觉得古怪，但我坚决反对土葬。我已留下详尽指示要求火葬——哈珀会确保执行。火焰是最纯净的元素，能终结死亡与腐朽间所有可憎过程。想到要在虫蛀的霉烂棺材里腐烂，我就无法忍受。\"\n\n他继续详述这个病态的执念，凹陷的眼窝里闪动着痛苦的光芒，声音里压抑着几近歇斯底里的紧绷。我忆起阿加莎夫人下葬与复活的传说，理解了他对土葬的厌恶，却不知这反感背后藏着怎样骇人的真相。\n\n哈珀送完雪莉酒便消失了，想必是去收拾我的客房。当我们饮尽最后一杯，先前被酒精短暂激发的神采从爵士脸上褪去，他看起来比任何时候都憔悴。我借口疲惫告退时，这位礼数周全的绅士坚持亲自送我到客房。\n\n在楼上走廊，我们遇见正从阁楼下来的哈珀。他端着盛有腐肉残渣的铁盘，经过时散发出的刺鼻腥臭令我联想到——不，这不可能——东方传说中食尸的恶魔。经过密室时，虽未闻嗥叫，但我确信听见了大型动物啃食骨肉的咀嚼声。\n\n尽管客房仍阴森可怖，至少蛛网尘埃已被清理。爵士离开时死灰般的面色令我内疚——招待客人或许加剧了他的病情。在那副彬彬有礼的面具下，我分明看到了隐忍的痛苦。\n\n长途跋涉的疲惫与酒精本该催人入眠，但古宅滋生的邪恶幻影纠缠着我。风雨声化作恶魔的窃窃私语，在漫漫长夜中向我耳语不可名状的可怖秘密。\n\n风暴平息后，一种诡异的抓挠声从密室方向传来，间或夹杂着约翰爵士痛苦的呻吟。这声音持续到破晓，当第一缕灰白曙光渗入窗棂，我才坠入沉眠。\n\n急促的敲门声将我惊醒。哈珀颤抖的身影还未开口，不祥的预感已攫住我的心。\"约翰爵士去世了，\"老人哽咽道，\"今早我发现他没应门...\"\n\n黎明时分那声呻吟突然有了答案。我忍不住猜想：那阵可憎的抓挠声是否加速了主人的死亡？尽管满脑骇人猜测，我仍协助老仆处理后事。爵士遗嘱要求用浮木在庄园后山搭建火葬堆，且除哈珀与抬棺人外不得有旁观者。\n\n浓雾与暴雨迫使仪式推迟。当我在暮色中返回宅邸时，哈珀反常地请求我陪他守灵。\"今晚的守夜可能很危险，\"他递给我一把古董左轮手枪，\"爵士会感谢您的。\"\n\n我们沿着走廊向停灵室走去时，我直截了当地问：\"哈珀，你到底在害怕什么？\"\n\n听到这个问题时，他明显瑟缩了一下，似乎不愿作答。片刻之后，他才意识到坦诚相告的必要性。\n\n\"是禁闭室里的那个东西，\"他解释道，\"您肯定听见动静了，先生。二十八年来，我和约翰爵士一直负责照料它。我们始终担心它会破笼而出——只要喂饱它倒也不常闹事。可最近三晚，它一直在抓挠约翰爵士卧室的橡木墙，这可是前所未有的事。爵士认为这东西预感到他大限将至，想啃食他的尸体......因为它已经厌倦了我们提供的食物。所以今晚我们必须严加看守，查丹先生。我祈求上帝让那堵墙撑住，但那东西像恶魔般不停地抓挠。最可怕的是抓挠声越来越空洞——仿佛墙壁正在变薄。\"\n\n这番证词证实了我最不愿面对的猜测，惊骇之下我无言以对，任何评论都将是徒劳。哈珀的坦白让异常事件蒙上了更阴森恐怖的阴影，威胁感愈发强烈。我宁愿逃避这场守夜——但显然已无退路。\n\n经过禁闭室时，兽性十足的抓挠声比先前更响亮更疯狂，直刺耳膜。此刻我完全理解了老人邀我作伴的缘由。那声音带着狰狞的执念与食尸鬼般的饥渴，令人毛骨悚然。当我们踏入停尸间时，伴随着可怕的撕裂声，动静变得愈发清晰。\n\n整个丧葬日我都刻意回避这个房间，毕竟我没有瞻仰遗容的癖好。因此这是我第二次也是最后一次见到宅邸主人。他身着正装躺在冰冷的白床上，厚重的绣帷窗帘已然拉开，几支细长蜡烛在泛着铜绿的古老烛台上摇曳，但阴森的停尸间里，这点光亮只投下飘忽的哀影。\n\n我不情愿地瞥向死者面容，又立即移开视线。我预料到石雕般的苍白与僵硬，却未料到那张脸上凝固着非人的恐惧与憎恶——这些情绪必定在漫长岁月里侵蚀着他的心脏，而生前竟被他以超人般的自制力隐藏。这发现太过痛苦，我不敢再看第二眼。恍惚间他仿佛尚未死去，仍在痛苦地聆听那些可能诱发他最终发病的恐怖声响。\n\n几把与床榻同属十七世纪的椅子散落四周。我和哈珀坐在小黑木墙边的小桌旁，墙后持续传来抓挠声。我们默然掏出左轮手枪，开始了这场毛骨悚然的守夜。\n\n等待期间，我不禁想象那不可名状的怪物，脑海中接连浮现出墓穴噩梦的扭曲影像。一种反常的好奇驱使我想询问哈珀，但更强烈的克制阻止了我。老人则始终沉默，只有那双在震颤头颅中异常明亮的眼睛死死盯着墙壁。\n\n随后几小时充斥着超自然的紧张感，任何语言都难以描述。木质墙壁本应能抵御任何爪牙生物的袭击，但每分每秒我都觉得它即将崩塌。抓挠声永无止境，在我发热的想象中越来越近。间歇还能听见低沉急切的呜咽，像饥饿野兽接近猎物时的动静。\n\n我们心照不宣地回避着怪物破墙后的应对方案。但我开始迷信地怀疑子弹是否真能伤害这个拥有人类血统的怪物。它究竟继承了多少来自神秘父系的特性？虽然不断告诫自己这些念头荒诞不经，我却像被深渊吸引般反复思索。\n\n黑夜如粘稠的暗河流淌，葬礼蜡烛即将燃尽。唯有烛芯提醒着时间的流逝，我仿佛溺毙在永恒的黑暗中，任由无形恐怖爬满全身。当我对持续不断的抓挠声逐渐麻木时，守夜突然迎来了终局。\n\n正当我凝神注视墙壁，一阵刺耳的碎裂声骤然响起——条窄木片从镶板剥落。还未等我反应过来，整片半圆形墙板便在重击下分崩离析。\n\n或许该说是仁慈，我始终无法清晰回忆破墙而出的地狱光景。过度的视觉冲击已将细节从记忆中抹去。只模糊记得一个苍白无毛的类四足身躯，半人脸上长着犬齿，前肢末端延伸着鬣狗般的利爪。腐臭气息先于怪物现身，随后它一个噩梦般的飞跃扑向我们。\n\n哈珀的枪声在密闭空间炸响，而我的扳机只发出生锈般的咔嗒声。未及再次扣动，我已重重摔向地面，后脑撞上桌脚。无数火星在眼前迸溅，随即陷入黑暗。\n\n当我再度恢复意识时，首先闻到布料燃烧的焦臭。翻倒的桌边，我看见烛火引燃了床幔，火舌正吞噬着华盖。燃烧的碎布如血红色蝴蝶纷纷落在约翰·特雷莫斯爵士的遗体上，霎时将其围成火圈。\n\n我踉跄起身，发现房间只剩躺在门边呻吟的老仆。洞开的房门暗示有\"某物\"在我昏迷时离开了。转身时，火焰尚未快过我的视线——如果那些还能称作\"手\"和\"面容\"的话。关于爵士最终的惨状，请恕我无法详述。那怪物终究被火焰惊走了......\n\n黎明将近，我们逃出宅邸。雨停后的天空堆砌着死灰色云层。老仆在我身旁颤抖着注视冲天火柱，突然指向湿润泥土上新鲜深刻的脚印——带着犬科爪痕的半人类足迹，蜿蜒通向庄园后的石楠荒丘。\n\n我们循迹来到封闭数十年的家族墓穴。生锈的铁链锁已被非人怪力扯断。借着火柴微光，我们持浸水木棍深入墓穴，却只在霉味中发现渐淡的足迹。最终哈珀颤抖着开口：\"多年前阿加莎夫人死后，我们搜遍墓穴一无所获。如今亦然。有些奥秘注定永无答案。我们只知道墓穴的子嗣已回归墓穴——愿它永驻于此。\"\n\n在我战栗的心中，这句诅咒正反复回响。"

        "content": "\n\nIt is indeed strange that John Milwarp and his writings should have fallen so speedily into semi-oblivion. His books, treating of Oriental life in a somewhat flowery, romantic style, were popular a few months ago. But now, in spite of their range and penetration, their pervasive verbal sorcery, they are seldom mentioned; and they seem to have vanished unaccountably from the shelves of book-stores and libraries.\n\nEven the mystery of Milwarp's death, baffling to both law and science, has evoked but a passing interest, an excitement quickly lulled and forgotten.\n\nI was well acquainted with Milwarp over a term of years. But my recollection of the man is becoming strangely blurred, like an image in a misted mirror. His dark, half-alien personality, his preoccupation with the occult, his immense knowledge of Eastern life and lore, are things I remember with such effort and vagueness as attends the recovery of a dream. Sometimes I almost doubt that he ever existed. It is as if the man, and all that pertains to him, were being erased from human record by some mysterious acceleration of the common process of obliteration.\n\nIn his will, he appointed me his executor. I have vainly tried to interest publishers in the novel he left among his papers: a novel surely not inferior to anything he ever wrote. They say that his vogue has passed. Now I am publishing as a magazine story the contents of the diary kept by Milwarp for a period preceding his demise.\n\nPerhaps, for the open-minded, this diary will explain the enigma of his death. It would seem that the circumstances of that death are virtually forgotten, and I repeat them here as part of my endeavor to revive and perpetuate Milwarp's memory.\n\nMilwarp had returned to his house in San Francisco after a long sojourn in Indo-China. We who knew him gathered that he had gone into places seldom visited by Occidentals. At the time of his demise he had just finished correcting the typescript of a novel which dealt with the more romantic and mysterious aspects of Burma.\n\nOn the morning of April 2nd, 1933, his housekeeper, a middle-aged woman, was startled by a glare of brilliant light which issued from the half-open door of Milwarp's study. It was as if the whole room were in flames. Horrified, the woman hastened to investigate. Entering the study, she saw her master sitting in an armchair at the table, wearing the rich, somber robes of Chinese brocade which he affected as a dressing-gown. He sat stiffly erect, a pen clutched unmoving in his fingers on the open pages of a manuscript volume. About him, in a sort of nimbus, glowed and flickered the strange light; and her only thought was that his garments were on fire.\n\nShe ran toward him, crying out a warning. At that moment the weird nimbus brightened intolerably, and the wan early dayshine, the electric bulbs that still burned to attest the night's labor, were alike blotted out. It seemed to the housekeeper that something had gone wrong with the room itself; for the walls and table vanished, and a great, luminous gulf opened before her; and on the verge of the gulf, in a seat that was not his cushioned armchair but a huge and rough-hewn seat of stone, she beheld her master stark and rigid. His heavy brocaded robes were gone, and about him, from head to foot, were blinding coils of pure white fire, in the form of linked chains. She could not endure the brilliance of the chains, and cowering back, she shielded her eyes with her hands. When she dared to look again, the weird glowing had faded, the room was as usual; and Milwarp's motionless figure was seated at the table in the posture of writing.\n\nShaken and terrified as she was, the woman found courage to approach her master. A hideous smell of burnt flesh arose from beneath his garments, which were wholly intact and without visible trace of fire. He was dead, his fingers clenched on the pen and his features frozen in a stare of tetanic agony. His neck and wrists were completely encircled by frightful burns that had charred them deeply. The coroner, in his examination, found that these burns, preserving an outline as of heavy links, were extended in long unbroken spirals around the arms and legs and torso. The burning was apparently the cause of Milwarp's death: it was as if iron chains, heated to incandescence, had been wrapped about him.\n\nSmall credit was given to the housekeeper's story of what she had seen. No one, however, could suggest an acceptable explanation of the bizarre mystery. There was, at the time, much aimless discussion; but, as I have hinted, people soon turned to other matters. The efforts made to solve the riddle were somewhat perfunctory. Chemists tried to determine the nature of a queer drug, in the form of a gray powder with pearly granules, to whose use Milwarp had become addicted. But their tests merely revealed the presence of an alkaloid whose source and attributes were obscure to Western science.\n\nDay by day, the whole incredible business lapsed from public attention; and those who had known Milwarp began to display the forgetfulness that was no less unaccountable than his weird doom. The housekeeper, who had held steadfastly in the beginning to her story, came at length to share the common dubiety. Her account, with repetition, became vague and contradictory; detail by detail, she seemed to forget the abnormal circumstances that she had witnessed with overwhelming horror.\n\nThe manuscript volume, in which Milwarp had apparently been writing at the time of death, was given into my charge with his other papers. It proved to be a diary, its last entry breaking off abruptly. Since reading the diary, I have hastened to transcribe it in my own hand, because, for some mysterious reason, the ink of the original is already fading and has become almost illegible in places.\n\nThe reader will note certain lacunae, due to passages written in an alphabet which neither I nor any scholar of my acquaintance can transliterate. These passages seem to form an integral part of the narrative, and they occur mainly toward the end, as if the writer had turned more and more to a language remembered from his ancient avatar. To the same mental reversion one must attribute the singular dating, in which Milwarp, still employing English script, appears to pass from our contemporary notation to that of some premundane world.\n\nI give hereunder the entire diary, which begins with an undated footnote:\n\nThis book, unless I have been misinformed concerning the qualities of the drug souvara, will be the record of my former life in a lost cycle. I have had the drug in my possession for seven months, but fear has prevented me from using it. Now, by certain tokens, I perceive that the longing for knowledge will soon overcome the fear. Ever since my earliest childhood I have been troubled by intimations, dim, unplaceable, that seemed to argue a forgotten existence. These intimations partook of the nature of feelings rather than ideas or images: they were like the wraiths of dead memories. In the background of my mind there has lurked a sentiment of formless, melancholy desire for some nameless beauty long perished out of time. And, coincidentally, I have been haunted by an equally formless dread, an apprehension as of some bygone but still imminent doom.\n\nSuch feelings have persisted, undiminished, throughout my youth and maturity, but nowhere have I found any clue to their causation. My travels in the mystic Orient, my delvings into occultism have merely convinced me that these shadowy intuitions pertain to some incarnation buried under the wreck of remotest cycles.\n\nMany times, in my wanderings through Buddhistic lands, I had heard of the drug souvara, which is believed to restore, even for the uninitiate, the memory of other lives. And at last, after many vain efforts, I managed to procure a supply of the drug. The manner in which I obtained it is a tale sufficiently remarkable in itself, but of no special relevance here. So far — perhaps because of that apprehension which I have hinted — I have not dared to use the drug.\n\nMarch 9th, 1933. This morning I took souvara for the first time, dissolving the proper amount in pure distilled water as I had been instructed to do. Afterward I leaned back easily in my chair, breathing with a slow, regular rhythm. I had no preconceived idea of the sensations that would mark the drug's initial effect, since these were said to vary prodigiously with the temperament of the users; but I composed myself to await them with tranquility, after formulating clearly in my mind the purpose of the experinent. For a while there was no change in my awareness. I noticed a slight quickening of the pulse, and modulated my breathing in conformity with this. Then, by slow degrees, I experienced a sharpening of visual perception. The Chinese rugs on the floor, the backs of the serried volumes in my bookcases, the very wood of chairs, table and shelves, began to exhibit new and unimagined colors. At the same time there were curious alterations of outline, every object seeming to extend itself in a hitherto unsuspected fashion. Following this, my surroundings became semi-transparent, like molded shapes of mist. I found that I could see through the marbled cover the illustrations in a volume of John Martin's edition of Paradise Lost, which lay before me on the table.\n\nAll this, I knew, was a mere extension of ordinary physical vision. It was only a prelude to those apperceptions of occult realms which I sought through souvara. Fixing my mind once more on the goal of the experiment, I became aware that the misty walls had vanished like a drawn arras. About me, like reflections in rippled water, dim sceneries wavered and shifted, erasing one another from instant to instant. I seemed to hear a vague but ever-present sound, more musical than the murmurs of air, water or fire, which was a property of the unknown element that environed me.\n\nWith a sense of troublous familiarity, I beheld the blurred unstable pictures which flowed past me upon this never-resting medium. Orient temples, flashing with sun-struck bronze and gold; the sharp, crowded gables and spires of medieval cities; tropic and northern forests; the costumes and physiognomies of the Levant, of Persia, of old Rome and Carthage, went by like blown, flying mirages. Each succeeding tableau belonged to a more ancient period than the one before it — and I knew that each was a scene from some former existence of my own.\n\nStill tethered, as it were, to my present self, I reviewed these visible memories, which took on tri-dimensional depth and clarity. I saw myself as warrior and troubadour, as noble and merchant and mendicant. I trembled with dead fears, I thrilled with lost hopes and raptures, and was drawn by ties that death and Lethe had broken. Yet never did I fully identify myself with those other avatars: for I knew well that the memory I sought pertained to some incarnation of older epochs.\n\nStill the fantasmagoria streamed on, and I turned giddy with vertigo ineffable before the vastness and diuturnity of the cycles of being. It seemed that I, the watcher, was lost in a gray land where the homeless ghosts of all dead ages went fleeing from oblivion to oblivion.\n\nThe walls of Nineveh, the columns and towers of unnamed cities, rose before me and were swept away. I saw the luxuriant plains that are now the Gobi desert. The sealost capitals of Atlantis were drawn to the light in unquenched glory. I gazed on lush and cloudy scenes from the first continents of Earth. Briefly I relived the beginnings of terrestrial man — and knew that the secret I would learn was ancienter even than these.\n\nMy visions faded into black voidness — and yet, in that void, through fathomless eons, it seemed that I existed still like a blind atom in the space between the worlds. About me was the darkness and repose of that night which antedated the Earth's creation. Time flowed backward with the silence of dreamless sleep....\n\nThe illumination, when it came, was instant and complete. I stood in the full, fervid blaze of day amid royally towering blossoms in a deep garden, beyond whose lofty, vine-clad walls I heard the confused murmuring of the great city called Kalood. Above me, at their vernal zenith, were the four small suns that illumed the planet Hestan. Jewel-colored insects fluttered about me, lighting without fear on the rich habiliments of gold and black, enwrought with astronomic symbols, in which I was attired. Beside me was a dial-shaped altar of zoned agate, carved with the same symbols, which were those of the dreadful omnipotent time-god, Aforgomon, whom I served as a priest.\n\nI had not even the slightest memory of myself as John Milwarp, and the long pageant of my terrestrial lives was as something that had never been — or was yet to be. Sorrow and desolation choked my heart as ashes fill some urn consecrated to the dead; and all the hues and perfumes of the garden about me were redolent only of the bitterness of death. Gazing darkly upon the altar, I muttered blasphemy against Aforgomon, who, in his inexorable course, had taken away my beloved and had sent no solace for my grief. Separately I cursed the signs upon the altar: the stars, the worlds, the suns, the moons, that meted and fulfilled the processes of time. Belthoris, my betrothed, had died at the end of the previous autumn: and so, with double maledictions, I cursed the stars and planets presiding over that season.\n\nI became aware that a shadow had fallen beside my own on the altar, and knew that the dark sage and sorcerer Atmox had obeyed my summons. Fearfully but not without hope I turned toward him, noting first of all that he bore under his arm a heavy, sinister-looking volume with covers of black steel and hasps of adamant. Only when I had made sure of this did I lift my eyes to his face, which was little less somber and forbidding than the tome he carried.\n\n\"Greeting, O Calaspa,\" he said harshly. \"I have come against my own will and judgment. The lore that you request is in this volume; and since you saved me in former years from the inquisitorial wrath of the time-god's priests, I cannot refuse to share it with you. But understand well that even I, who have called upon names that are dreadful to utter, and have evoked forbidden presences, shall never dare to assist you in this conjuration. Gladly would I help you to hold converse with the shadow of Belthoris, or to animate her still unwithered body and draw it forth from the tomb. But that which you purpose is another matter. You alone must perform the ordained rites, must speak the necessary words: for the consequences of this thing will be direr than you deem.'\n\n\"I care not for the consequences,\" I replied eagerly, \"if it be possible to bring back the lost hours which I shared with Belthoris. Think you that I could content myself with her shadow, wandering thinly back from the Borderland? Or that I could take pleasure in the fair clay that the breath of necromancy has troubled and has made to arise and walk without mind or soul? Nay, the Belthoris I would summon is she on whom the shadow of death has never yet fallen!\n\nIt seemed that Atmox, the master of doubtful arts, the vassal of umbrageous powers, recoiled and blenched before my vehement declaration.\n\n\"Bethink you,\" he said with minatory sternness, \"that this thing will constitute a breach of the sacred logic of time and a blasphemy against Aforgomon, god of the minutes and the cycles. Moreover, there is little to be gained: for not in its entirety may you bring back the season of your love, but only one single hour, torn with infinite violence from its rightful period in time.... Refrain, I adjure you, and content yourself with a lesser sorcery.\"\n\n\"Give me the book,\" I demanded. \"My service to Aforgomon is forfeit. With due reverence and devotion I have worshipped the time-god, and have done in his honor the rites ordained from eternity; and for all this the god has betrayed me.\"\n\nThen, in that high-climbing, luxuriant garden beneath the four suns, Atmox opened the adamantine clasps of the steel-bound volume; and, turning to a certain page, he laid the book reluctantly in my hands. The page, like its fellows, was of some unholy parchment streaked with musty discolorations and blackening at the margin with sheer antiquity; but upon it shone unquenchably the dread characters a primal age had written with an ink bright as the newshed ichor of demons. Above this page I bent in my madness, conning it over and over till I was dazzled by the fiery runes; and, shutting my eyes, I saw them burn on a red darkness, still legible, and writhing like hellish worms.\n\nHollowly, like the sound of a far bell, I heard the voice of Atmox: \"You have learned, O Calaspa, the unutterable name of that One whose assistance can alone restore the fled hours. And you have learned the incantation that will rouse that hidden power, and the sacrifice needed for its propitiation. Knowing these things, is your heart still strong and your purpose firm?\"\n\nThe name I had read in the wizard volume was that of the chief cosmic power antagonistic to Aforgomon; the incantation and the required offering were those of a foul demonolatry. Nevertheless, I did not hesitate, but gave resolute affirmative answer to the somber query of Atmox.\n\nPerceiving that I was inflexible, he bowed his head, trying no more to dissuade me. Then, as the flame-runed volume had bade me do, I defiled the altar of Aforgomon, blotting certain of its prime symbols with dust and spittle.\n\nWhile Atmox looked on in silence, I wounded my right arm to its deepest vein on the sharp-tipped gnomon of the dial; and, letting the blood drip from zone to zone, from orb to orb on the graven agate, I made unlawful sacrifice, and intoned aloud, in the name of the Lurking Chaos, Xexanoth, an abominable ritual composed by a backward repetition and jumbling of litanies sacred to the time-god.\n\nEven as I chanted the incantation, it seemed that webs of shadow were woven foully athwart the suns; and the ground shook a little, as if colossal demons trod the world's rim, striding stupendously from abysses beyond. The garden walls and trees wavered like a wind-blown reflection in a pool; and I grew faint with the loss of that life-blood I had poured out in demonolatrous offering. Then, in my flesh and in my brain, I felt the intolerable racking of a vibration like the long-drawn shock of cities riven by earthquake, and coasts crumbling before some chaotic sea; and my flesh was torn and harrowed, and my brain shuddered with the toneless discords sweeping through me from deep to deep.\n\nI faltered, and confusion gnawed at my inmost being. Dimly I heard the prompting of Atmox, and dimmer still was the sound of my own voice that made answer to Xexanoth, naming the impious necromancy which was to be effected only through its power. Madly I implored from Xexanoth, in despite of time and its ordered seasons, one hour of that bygone autumn which I had shared with Belthoris; and imploring this, I named no special hour: for all, in memory, had seemed of an equal joy and gladness.\n\nAs the words ceased upon my lips, I thought that darkness fluttered in the air like a great wing; and the four suns went out, and my heart was stilled as if in death. Then the light returned, falling obliquely from suns mellow with full-tided autumn; and nowhere beside me was there any shadow of Atmox; and the altar of zoned agate was bloodless and undefiled. I, the lover of Belthoris, witting not of the doom and sorrow to come, stood happily with my beloved before the altar, and saw her young hands crown its ancient dial with the flowers we had plucked from the garden.\n\nDreadful beyond all fathoming are the mysteries of time. Even I, the priest and initiate, though wise in the secret doctrines of Aforgomon, know little enough of that elusive, ineluctable process whereby the present becomes the past and the future resolves itself into the present. All men have pondered the riddles of duration and transience; have wondered, vainly, to what bourn the lost days and the sped cycles are consigned. Some have dreamt that the past abides unchanged, becoming eternity as it slips from our mortal ken; and others have deemed that time is a stairway whose steps crumble one by one behind the climber, falling into a gulf of nothing.\n\nHowsoever this may be, I know that she who stood beside me was the Belthoris on whom no shadow of mortality had yet descended. The hour was one new-born in a golden season; and the minutes to come were pregnant with all wonder and surprise belonging to the untried future.\n\nTaller was my beloved than the frail, unbowed lilies of the garden. In her eyes was the sapphire of moonless evenings sown with small golden stars. Her lips were strangely curved, but only blitheness and joy had gone to their shaping. She and I had been betrothed from our childhood, and the time of the marriage-rites was now approaching. Our intercourse was wholly free, according to the custom of that world. Often she came to walk with me in my garden and to decorate the altar of that god whose revolving moons and suns would soon bring the season of our felicity.\n\nThe moths that flew about us, winged with aerial cloth-of-gold, were no lighter than our hearts. Making blithe holiday, we fanned our frolic mood to a high flame of rapture. We were akin to the full-hued, climbing flowers, the swift-darting insects, and our spirits blended and soared with the perfumes that were drawn skyward in the warm air. Unheard by us was the loud murmuring of the mighty city of Kalood lying beyond my garden walls; for us the many-peopled planet known as Hestan no longer existed; and we dwelt alone in a universe of light, in a blossomed heaven. Exalted by love in the high harmony of those moments, we seemed to touch eternity; and even I, the priest of Aforgomon, forgot the blossom-fretting days, the system-devouring cycles.\n\nIn the sublime folly of passion, I swore then that death or discord could never mar the perfect communion of our hearts. After we had wreathed the altar, I sought the rarest, the most delectable flowers; frail-curving cups of winewashed pearl, of moony azure and white with scrolled purple lips; and these I twined, between kisses and laughter, in the blaze maze of Belthoris' hair; saying that another shrine than that of time should receive its due offering.\n\nTenderly, with a lover's delay, I lingered over the wreathing; and, ere I had finished, there fluttered to the ground beside us a great, crimson-spotted moth whose wing had somehow been broken in its airy voyaging through the garden. And Belthoris, ever tender of heart and pitiful, turned from me and took up the moth in her hands; and some of the bright blossoms dropped from her hair unheeded. Tears welled from her deep blue eyes; and seeing that the moth was sorely hurt and would never fly again, she refused to be comforted; and no longer would she respond to my passionate wooing. I, who grieved less for the moth than she, was somewhat vexed; and between her sadness and my vexation, there grew between us some tiny, temporary rift....\n\nThen, ere love had ended the misunderstanding; then while we stood before the dread altar of time with sundered hands, with eyes averted from each other, it seemed that a shroud of darkness descended upon the garden. I heard the crash and crumbling of shattered worlds, and a black flowing of ruinous things that went past me through the darkness. The dead leaves of winter were blown about me, and there was a falling of tears or rain.... Then the vernal suns came back, high-stationed in cruel splendor; and with them came the knowledge of all that had been, of Belthoris' death and my sorrow, and the madness that had led to forbidden sorcery. Vain now, like all other hours, was the resummoned hour; and doubly irredeemable was my loss. My blood dripped heavily on the dishallowed altar, my faintness grew deathly, and I saw through murky mist the face of Atmox beside me; and the face was like that of some comminatory demon....\n\nMarch 13th. I, John Milwarp, write this date and my name with an odd dubiety. My visionary experience under the drug souvara ended with that rilling of my blood on the symboled dial, that glimpse of the terror-distorted face of Atmox. All this was in another world, in a life removed from the present by births and deaths without number; and yet, it seems, not wholly have I returned from the twice-ancient past. Memories, broken but strangely vivid and living, press upon me from the existence of which my vision was a fragment; and portions of the lore of Hestan, and scraps of its history, and words from its lost language, arise unbidden in my mind.\n\nAbove all, my heart is still shadowed by the sorrow of Calaspa. His desperate necromancy, which would seem to others no more than a dream within a dream, is stamped as with fire on the black page of recollection. I know the awfulness of the god he had blasphemed; and the foulness of the demonolatry he had done, and the sense of guilt and despair under which he swooned. It is this that I have striven all my life to remember, this which I have been doomed to re-experience. And I fear with a great fear the further knowledge which a second experiment with the drug will reveal to me.\n\nThe next entry of Milwarp's diary begins with a strange dating in English script: 'The second day of the moon Occalat, in the thousand-and-ninth year of the Red Eon.' This dating, perhaps, is repeated in the language of Hestan: for, directly beneath it, a line of unknown ciphers is set apart. Several lines of the subsequent text are in the alien tongue; and then, as if by an unconscious reversion, Milwarp continues the diary in English. There is no reference to another experiment with souvara: but apparently such had been made, with a continued revival of his lost memories.\n\n...What genius of the nadir gulf had tempted me to this thing and had caused me to overlook the consequences? Verily, when I called up for myself and Belthoris an hour of former autumn, with all that was attendant upon the hour, that bygone interim was likewise evoked and repeated for the whole world Hestan, and the four suns of Hestan. From the full midst of spring, all men had stepped backward into autumn, keeping only the memory of things prior to the hour thus resurrected, and knowing not the events future to the hour. But, returning to the present, they recalled with amazement the unnatural necromancy; and fear and bewilderment were upon them; and none could interpret the meaning.\n\nFor a brief period, the dead had lived again; the fallen leaves had returned to the bough; the heavenly bodies had stood at a long-abandoned station; the flower had gone back into the seed, the plant into the root. Then, with eternal disorder set among all its cycles, time had resumed its delayed course.\n\nNo movement of any cosmic body, no year or instant of the future, would be precisely as it should have been. The error and discrepancy I had wrought would bear fruit in ways innumerable. The suns would find themselves at fault; the worlds and atoms would go always a little astray from their appointed bourns.\n\nIt was of these matters that Atmox spoke, warning me, after he had staunched my bleeding wound. For he too, in that relumined hour, had gone back and had lived again through a past happening. For him the hour was one in which he had descended into the nether vaults of his house. There, standing in a many-pentacled circle, with burning of unholy incense and uttering of accurst formulae, he had called upon a malign spirit from the bowels of Hestan and had questioned it concerning the future. But the spirit, black and voluminous as the fumes of pitch, refused to answer him directly and pressed furiously with its clawed members against the confines of the circle. It said only: \"Thou hast summoned me at thy peril. Potent are the spells thou hast used, and strong is the circle to withstand me, and I am restrained by time and space from the wreaking of my anger upon thee. But haply thou shalt summon me again, albeit in the same hour of the same autumn; and in that summoning the laws of time shall be broken, and a rift shall be made in space; and through the rift, though with some delay and divagation, I will yet win to thee.\"\n\nSaying no more, it prowled restlessly about the circle; and its eyes burned down upon Atmox like embers in a highlifted sooty brazier; and ever and anon its fanged mouth was flattened on the spell-defended air. And in the end he could dismiss it only after a double repetition of the form of exorcism.\n\nAs he told me this tale in the garden, Atmox trembled; and his eyes searched the narrow shadows wrought by the high suns; and he seemed to listen for the noise of some evil thing that burrowed toward him beneath the earth.\n\nFourth day of the moon Occalat. Stricken with terrors beyond those of Atmox, I kept apart in my mansion amid the city of Kalood. I was still weak with the loss of blood I had yielded to Xexanoth; my senses were full of strange shadows; my servitors, coming and going about me, were as phantoms, and scarcely I heeded the pale fear in their eyes or heard the dreadful things they whispered.... Madness and chaos, they told me, were abroad in Kalood; the divinity of Aforgomon was angered. All men thought that some baleful doom impended because of that unnatural confusion which had been wrought among the hours of time.\n\nThis afternoon they brought me the story of Atmox's death. In bated tones they told me how his neophytes had heard a roaring as of a loosed tempest in the chamber where he sat alone with his wizard volumes and paraphernalia. Above the roaring, for a little, human screams had sounded, together with a dashing as of hurled censers and braziers, a crashing as of overthrown tables and tomes. Blood rilled from under the shut door of the chamber, and, rilling, it took from instant to instant the form of dire ciphers that spelt an unspeakable name. After the noises had ceased, the neophytes waited a long while ere they dared to open the door. Entering at last, they saw the floor and the walls heavily bespattered with blood, and rags of the sorcerer's raiment mingled everywhere with the sheets of his torn volumes of magic, and the shreds and manglings of his flesh strewn amid broken furniture, and his brains daubed in a horrible paste on the high ceiling.\n\nHearing this tale, I knew that the earthly demon feared by Atmox had found him somehow and had wreaked its wrath upon him. In ways unguessable, it had reached him through the chasm made in ordered time and space by one hour repeated through necromancy. And because of that lawless chasm, the magician's power and lore had utterly failed to defend him from the demon....\n\nFifth day of the moon Occalat. Atrnox, I am sure, had not betrayed me: for in so doing, he must have betrayed his own implicit share in my crime.... Howbeit, this evening the priests came to my house ere the setting of the westernmost sun: silent, grim, with eyes averted as if from a foulness innominable. Me, their fellow, they enjoined with loth gestures to accompany them....\n\nThus they took me from my house and along the thoroughfares of Kalood toward the lowering suns. The streets were empty of all other passers, and it seemed that no man desired to meet or behold the blasphemer....\n\nDown the avenue of gnomon-shaped pillars, I was led to the portals of Aforgomon's fane: those awfully gaping portals arched in the likeness of some devouring chimera's mouth....\n\nSixth day of the moon Occalat. They had thrust me into an oubliette beneath the temple, dark, noisome and soundless except for the maddening, measured drip of water beside me. There I lay and knew not when the night passed and the morning came. Light was admitted only when my captors opened the iron door, coming to lead me before the tribunal...\n\n...Thus the priests condemned me, speaking with one voice in whose dreadful volume the tones of all were indistinguishably blended. Then the aged high-priest Helpenor called aloud upon Aforgomon, offering himself as a mouthpiece to the god, and asking the god to pronounce through him the doom that was adequate for such enormities as those of which I had been judged guilty by my fellows.\n\nInstantly, it seemed, the god descended into Helpenor; and the figure of the high-priest appeared to dilate prodigiously beneath his mufflings; and the accents that issued from his mouth were like thunders of the upper heaven:\n\n\"O Calaspa, thou hast set disorder amid all future hours and eons through this evil necromancy. Thereby, moreover, thou hast wrought thine own doom: fettered art thou for ever to the hour thus unlawfully repeated, apart from its due place in time. According to hieratic rule, thou shalt meet the death of the fiery chains: but deem not that this death is more than the symbol of thy true punishment. Thou shalt pass hereafter through other lives in Hestan, and shalt climb midway in the cycles of the world subsequent to Hestan in time and space. But through all thine incarnations the chaos thou hast invoked will attend thee widening ever like a rift. And always, in all thy lives, the rift will bar thee from reunion with the soul of Belthoris; and always, though merely by an hour, thou shalt miss the love that should otherwise have been oftentimes regained.\"\n\n\"At last, when the chasm has widened overmuch, thy soul shall fare no farther in the onward cycles of incarnation. At that time it shall be given thee to remember clearly thine ancient sin; and remembering, thou shalt perish out of time. Upon the body of that latter life shall be found the charred imprint of the chains, as the final token of thy bondage. But they that knew thee will soon forget, and thou shalt belong wholly to the cycles limited for thee by thy sin.\"\n\nMarch 29th. I write this date with infinite desperation, trying to convince myself that there is a John Milwarp who exists on Earth, in the Twentieth Century. For two days running, I have not taken the drug souvara: and yet I have returned twice to that oubliette of Aforgomon's temple, in which the priest Calaspa awaits his doom. Twice I have been immersed in its stagnant darkness, hearing the slow drip of water beside me, like a clepsydra that tells the black ages of the damned.\n\nEven as I write this at my library table, it seems that an ancient midnight plucks at the lamp. The bookcases turn to walls of oozing, nighted stone. There is no longer a table ... nor one who writes... and I breathe the noisome dankness of a dungeon lying unfathomed by any sun, in a lost world.\n\nEighteenth day of the moon Occalat. Today, for the last time, they took me from my prison. Helpenor, together with three others, came and led me to the adytum of the god. Far beneath the outer temple we went, through spacious crypts unknown to the common worshippers. There was no word spoken, no glance exchanged between the others and me; and it seemed that they already regarded me as one cast out from time and claimed by oblivion.\n\nWe came ultimately to that sheer-falling gulf in which the spirit of Aforgomon is said to dwell. Lights, feeble and far-scattered, shone around it like stars on the rim of cosmic vastness, shedding no ray into the depths. There, in a seat of hewn stone overhanging the frightful verge, I was placed by the executioners; and a ponderous chain of black unrusted metal, stapled to the solid rock, was wound about and about me, circling my naked body and separate limbs, from head to foot.\n\nTo this doom, others had been condemned for heresy or impiety... though never for a sin such as mine. After the chaining of the victim, he was left for a stated interim, to ponder his crime — and haply to confront the dark divinity of Aforgomon. At length, from the abyss into which his position forced him to peer, a light would dawn, and a bolt of strange flame would leap upward, striking the many coiled chain about him and heating it instantly to the whiteness of candescent iron. The source and nature of the flame were mysterious, and many ascribed it to the god himself rather than to mortal agency....\n\nEven thus they have left me, and have gone away. Long since the burden of the massy links, cutting deeper and deeper into my flesh, has become an agony. I am dizzy from gazing downward into the abyss — and yet I cannot fall. Beneath, immeasurably beneath, at recurrent intervals, I hear a hollow and solemn sound. Perhaps it is the sigh of sunken waters ... of cavern-straying winds ... or the respiration of One that abides in the darkness, meting with his breath the slow minutes, the hours, the days, the ages.... My terror has become heavier than the chain, my vertigo is born of a two-fold gulf....\n\nEons have passed by and all the worlds have ebbed into nothingness, like wreckage borne on a chasm-falling stream, taking with them the lost face of Belthoris. I am poised above the gaping maw of the Shadow.... Somehow, in another world, an exile phantom has written these words... a phantom who must fade utterly from time and place, even as I, the doomed priest Calaspa. I cannot remember the name of the phantom.\n\nBeneath me, in the black depths, there is an awful brightening...",

"约翰·米尔沃普及其著作竟如此迅速地陷入半湮没状态，实在令人费解。他那用华丽浪漫笔触描绘东方生活的著作，数月前还风靡一时。可如今，尽管内涵深邃、文字魔魅，却鲜少被人提及；那些书仿佛被无形之手从书店与图书馆的书架上尽数抹去。\n\n即便是米尔沃普离奇死亡的谜团——连法律与科学都束手无策的悬案——也仅激起转瞬即逝的关注，旋即被世人抛诸脑后。\n\n我与米尔沃普相交经年。但关于此人的记忆正诡异地模糊起来，如同雾镜中的影像。他阴郁的半异质人格、对秘术的痴迷、渊博的东方学识，这些记忆如同从梦境中艰难打捞的残片，愈发飘忽难辨。有时我几乎怀疑他是否真实存在过。仿佛某种神秘力量正加速着常规的湮灭进程，要将此人及其相关的一切从人类记录中彻底抹除。\n\n根据遗嘱，我成为他的遗产执行人。他遗稿中的那部小说——水准绝不逊于其任何作品——却始终无法引起出版商兴趣。他们宣称米尔沃普的时代已经过去。如今我将把他临终前所写的日记内容以杂志连载形式公诸于世。\n\n或许对思想开明者而言，这本日记能解开他的死亡之谜。鉴于相关细节几乎被世人遗忘，在此我重述经过，以期唤醒并延续对米尔沃普的记忆。\n\n久居印度支那后，米尔沃普回到了旧金山寓所。据我们这些故交所知，他曾深入西方人罕至之地。离世时，他刚完成一部描写缅甸浪漫秘境的校样稿。\n\n1933年4月2日清晨，中年女管家被书房半掩门扉中迸射的强光惊醒。整间屋子恍若陷入火海。她惊恐地前去查看，发现主人身着惯穿的暗色中式织锦睡袍，僵直地端坐在扶手椅上，手指紧扣钢笔停滞于摊开的手稿本上。奇异的辉光如晕轮般在他周身明灭，令她误以为衣物起火。\n\n她呼喊着冲向前去。霎时间那诡异光晕暴涨，将晨光与通宵工作的电灯尽数吞噬。在管家眼中，整个房间开始扭曲——墙壁与书桌消失不见，眼前裂开一道发光的深渊。深渊边缘，主人僵坐在粗凿的石座上（而非原先的软垫扶手椅），繁复睡袍已化为缠绕全身的刺目白焰锁链。强光迫使她掩目后退。待她再度睁眼，异象已然消散，房间恢复原状，米尔沃普仍保持着书写姿势凝固在桌前。\n\n尽管惊魂未定，女管家仍鼓起勇气上前查看。衣物完好无损，却散发出骇人的焦肉气息。死者手指紧攥钢笔，面容凝固在破伤风般的痛苦痉挛中。脖颈与手腕布满环状焦痕，尸检显示这些链状灼伤呈螺旋状延伸至四肢躯干。法医判定死因系高温灼烧——仿佛有人将白炽的铁链缠裹其身。\n\n无人采信女管家的离奇见闻，却也无人能合理解释这桩诡案。当时虽议论纷纷，但正如前文所言，公众很快转向其他话题。调查敷衍了事，化学家们试图分析米尔沃普生前沉迷的珍珠质灰粉状药物，却只鉴定出某种西方科学无法溯源的生物碱。\n\n日复一日，这桩奇闻淡出公众视野。与米尔沃普相识之人表现出的遗忘倾向，竟与其诡异死亡同样难以解释。最初坚持己见的女管家，最终也开始自我怀疑。她的证词在反复叙述中变得矛盾模糊，那些骇人细节正被逐步遗忘。\n\n米尔沃普临终时正在书写的手稿本与其他文件一并交予我保管。这是本突然中断的日记。阅读后我立即着手誊抄——因某种神秘原因，原稿墨迹正飞速褪色，部分已难以辨认。\n\n读者将注意到某些用陌生文字书写的段落（我与任何学者都无从破译），它们主要出现在日记末尾，仿佛书写者正逐渐回归某个古老化身的语言体系。同样异常的还有纪年方式：米尔沃普虽沿用英文书写，日期标注却似从现代转入某个史前纪年。\n\n以下为日记全文，始于一条未标注日期的脚注：\n\n若关于苏瓦拉药性的记载无误，本书将记录我某个失落轮回中的前世。拥有此药七个月来，恐惧始终阻我服用。而今种种征兆表明，求知欲终将战胜恐惧。自童年起，那些暗示着被遗忘存在的朦胧直觉便困扰着我——它们更接近情感而非具体意象，如同死寂记忆的幽魂。心灵深处始终萦绕着对某种湮灭之美的无名渴望，与之相伴的则是同样无名的恐惧，恍若某种过往却仍将临头的厄运。\n\n这些感受贯穿我的青年与盛年，却始终找不到根源。在神秘东方的游历与秘术研究只让我确信：这些朦胧直觉属于某个湮灭在远古轮回中的前世。\n\n在佛教国度漫游时，我屡次听闻苏瓦拉能唤醒未修行者的前世记忆。历经周折终于获得此药（获取过程本身已堪称奇谈，但与主题无关）。出于前文所述的恐惧，我一直未敢服用。\n\n1933年3月9日。今晨首次服用苏瓦拉，按指示将定量药剂溶于蒸馏水。饮毕我放松地靠在椅背上调节呼吸。据说药效因人而异，故未预设体验。待心神澄明后，我开始静候变化。起初意识如常，仅脉搏稍快。随后视野逐渐锐化：地毯、书脊、木质家具皆显现出超乎想象的新色泽，物体轮廓也开始以不可思议的方式延展。接着周遭环境雾化透明，我甚至能透视桌上《失乐园》插图本的云石纹封面。\n\n我明白这只是常规视觉的延伸，真正期待的秘界感知尚未开始。当再度凝神时，雾墙如帷幕般消散。涟漪般的朦胧景致在四周流转更迭，仿佛水波倒影。耳畔响起超越风火水鸣的玄妙之声，源自包裹我的未知介质。\n\n那些掠过的模糊画面唤起诡异的熟悉感：阳光镀金的东方庙宇、中世纪拥挤的尖顶城郭、热带与寒带森林、黎凡特与古罗马的服饰面容......每幅画面都比前一帧更为古老——我深知这些都是自己的前世残影。\n\n仍锚定于现世的我，以立体清晰的视角审视这些记忆碎片：武士、吟游诗人、贵族、商贾、乞丐......已死的恐惧令我战栗，湮灭的希望与狂喜使我震颤，被死亡与忘川斩断的羁绊再度缠绕。但我始终未能与这些化身完全认同——因我追寻的记忆属于更古老的纪元。\n\n幻象洪流令我晕眩。作为观察者的我，仿佛迷失在灰色国度，见证所有时代的亡魂在遗忘间奔逃。尼尼微城墙、无名都市的巨柱高塔相继涌现又消逝。我见到如今戈壁沙漠曾经的丰饶平原，亚特兰蒂斯沉没的都城以未减的辉煌浮出水面。凝视着地球原始大陆的葱郁景象，我短暂重历了人类起源——而我寻求的秘密比这一切更为古老。\n\n幻象没入虚无。在这跨越永恒的无光虚空中，我如盲目的原子飘荡在创世前的黑夜。时间以无梦沉睡般的寂静倒流......\n\n光明骤临。我立于赫斯坦星球四轮骄阳下，置身卡鲁德城高墙环绕的御花园。珠宝色昆虫落在我绣有天文符号的黑金法袍上。身旁带状玛瑙祭坛镌刻着相同符号——它们属于我所侍奉的、可怖的全能时神阿弗戈蒙。此刻我全然忘却约翰·米尔沃普的存在，尘世轮回的记忆仿佛从未发生——或尚未发生。\n\n哀恸如死灰填满葬瓮般堵塞心腔，园中斑斓芬芳只令我嗅到死亡的苦涩。我阴郁地凝视祭坛，向无情掠走挚爱却未赐慰藉的阿弗戈蒙发出渎神之语，逐一诅咒祭坛上标记时序流转的星体符号。未婚妻贝尔索里斯在上个秋末逝去，我以双重诅咒降祸于当值星宿。\n\n祭坛上浮现第二道阴影——黑暗智者、巫师亚特莫克斯应召而来。我忐忑而希冀地转身，首先注意到他腋下那本黑钢封面、金刚锁扣的邪异典籍。确认此物后，我才抬头面对他那与典籍同样阴森的面容。\n\n\"向你致意，卡拉帕。\"他厉声道，\"我违心而来。因你曾救我免遭时神祭司审判，不得不将此卷秘术相授。但需明白：即便是我——曾召唤不可言说之名、招引禁忌存在之人——也绝不敢助你完成此等咒法。我甘愿帮你召唤贝尔索里斯的幽魂，或驱使她未腐的躯壳离墓行走。但你所图谋的远非如此。唯有你能施行仪轨、诵念咒文——其后果比你想象的更为可怖。\"\n\n\"若能唤回与贝尔索里斯共度的时光，后果何足挂齿。\"我热切回应，\"你以为我会满足于自冥界归来的稀薄幽影？或会欣喜于招魂术唤醒的无魂躯壳？不！我要召唤的是死亡从未触碰过的贝尔索里斯！\"\n\n精研邪术、侍奉幽暗之力的亚特莫克斯，竟在我宣言前退缩失色。\n\n\"你可曾思量，\"他以阴森可怖的语调警告道，\"此举将撕裂时间神圣的法则，更是对分秒与轮回之神阿弗戈蒙的亵渎。何况所得甚微：你无法唤回整个挚爱的季节，只能攫取其中一小时光——以无穷暴力从时序长河中生生扯下的破碎片段......收手吧，我恳求你，满足于次等的巫术便好。\"\n\n\"把书给我，\"我厉声要求，\"我对阿弗戈蒙的侍奉就此终结。我怀着虔诚与热忱供奉这位时序之神，履行亘古规定的仪式；而神明却以背叛回报。\"\n\n于是在四轮骄阳照耀下藤蔓攀爬的巍峨花园里，亚特莫克斯不情愿地解开钢封典籍的金刚石扣，翻至特定页码递给我。那页与其余同样，是用某种亵渎的羊皮制成，霉斑如血管蔓延，边缘因年代久远而焦黑；但上面燃烧着太古文字，用恶魔初诞时闪亮的脓血书就，永不褪色。我癫狂地俯身研读，直至炽热符文灼伤双眼；闭目时仍见它们在血色黑暗中扭动，如地狱蛆虫般清晰可辨。\n\n亚特莫克斯的声音如远方钟鸣空洞回荡：\"卡拉斯帕啊，你已知晓那位不可言说者的名讳，唯有祂能唤回消逝时光。你也学会了唤醒那股隐秘力量的咒语，以及取悦祂所需的祭品。知晓这一切后，你的心仍如铁石般坚定吗？\"\n\n那本巫术典籍揭示的名讳，正是与阿弗戈蒙抗衡的宇宙主宰；所需咒语与祭品皆属邪恶的恶魔崇拜仪式。但我毫不迟疑，以斩钉截铁的回答回应亚特莫克斯阴郁的质询。\n\n见我意志如钢，他垂首不再劝阻。我按火焰符文的指示玷污阿弗戈蒙祭坛，以尘土与唾沫遮蔽其核心符号。在亚特莫克斯沉默注视下，我将右臂深深划向日晷锋利的晷针，任鲜血滴落玛瑙刻盘的分区与星体图案，以渎神之礼向潜伏的混沌之神泽克萨诺斯献祭。我高声吟诵倒错时序神祷文拼凑的秽恶仪轨。\n\n咒语响起时，阴影之网污浊地遮蔽四轮太阳；大地震颤，恍若巨魔正从深渊边缘踏向人世。花园围墙与树木如池中倒影般摇曳，我因失血而昏眩。随后血肉与脑髓中爆发出难以忍受的震荡，如同地震撕裂城邦、混沌之海吞噬海岸的漫长剧痛。我的躯体被撕扯犁耕，无调的噪音在脑髓深渊间来回冲刷。\n\n我踉跄着，混乱啃噬灵魂深处。朦胧听见亚特莫克斯的提示，更微弱的是我自己回应泽克萨诺斯的声音，陈述唯有借助其力量才能完成的渎神死灵术。我疯狂祈求泽克萨诺斯逆乱时序，还我与贝尔索里斯共度的往昔秋日一小时——未指定具体时刻：因记忆中每个片段都同等欢愉。\n\n语毕刹那，黑暗如巨翼拍打天穹，四轮太阳骤然熄灭，心脏如死亡般静止。当光线再度降临，已是饱满秋阳的斜晖；亚特莫克斯的身影消失无踪，带状玛瑙祭坛洁净如新。我——贝尔索里斯的爱人，尚未知晓将至的厄运——正与挚爱欢立于祭坛前，看她用采撷的鲜花装点古老日晷。\n\n时间之谜恐怖得超乎想象。即便身为通晓阿弗戈蒙秘仪的祭司，我对当下沦为往昔、未来凝为此刻的玄奥过程仍知之甚少。众生皆思索过永恒与须臾的谜题：消逝的日月轮回归于何处？有人幻想往昔永恒不变，脱离凡俗认知后即成不朽；另有人认为时间如阶梯，攀登者身后的台阶会逐一崩落虚无深渊。\n\n无论如何，我知身侧之人确是未染死亡阴影的贝尔索里斯。此刻是金色季节新生的时刻，未来分钟满载未经尝试的奇迹。她比园中挺立的百合更高挑，眼眸盛着无月之夜点缀金星的蓝宝石光辉。唇线弧度奇妙，却只由欢欣塑造。我们自幼订婚，婚期将至。按此世风俗，我们自由相处。她常来花园共游，装饰那位以日月轮转昭示吉时的神祇祭坛。\n\n环绕我们的飞蛾披着空中金纱，不及我们心情轻盈。我们将嬉戏情绪煽动成狂喜烈焰，与攀援的艳花、疾飞的虫豸共鸣，灵魂随暖风中升腾的芬芳翱翔。园墙外卡鲁德城的喧嚣于我们不复存在，赫斯坦星球的亿万居民已然消失，我们独居于光之宇宙、花之天堂。在爱的极致和谐中，我们仿佛触及永恒；连我这阿弗戈蒙祭司也忘却摧残花朵的时日、吞噬星系的轮回。\n\n在激情的崇高痴狂中，我誓言死亡与纷乱永不能破坏我们心灵的完美交融。装饰祭坛后，我寻觅最珍稀的花朵——酒渍珍珠般的卷曲杯盏、月华染就的蓝白花瓣镶紫纹唇缘——在亲吻与欢笑间编入贝尔索里斯发间，宣称时间祭坛外应有另一处圣地接受供奉。\n\n我以恋人特有的缠绵编织花环，未竟时忽有猩红斑纹的巨蛾坠落脚边，翅膀在花园漫游时折断。心软的贝尔索里斯转身捧起飞蛾，任发间鲜花零落。深蓝眼眸涌出泪水，见飞蛾伤势过重，她拒绝安慰，不再回应我的热切求爱。我为她的悲伤而非飞蛾之死恼火，我们之间生出细微裂痕......\n\n就在这误解未消、我们于可怖时序祭坛前松手避视的刹那，黑暗裹尸布般笼罩花园。我听见世界崩裂的轰鸣，毁灭洪流裹挟黑暗掠过身侧。冬日枯叶盘旋，泪雨倾盆......待春日骄阳重现残酷光辉时，我已知晓贝尔索里斯之死、我的哀恸与招致禁忌巫术的疯狂。被唤回的时光如所有其他时刻般徒劳，我的损失却加倍不可挽回。鲜血沉重滴落渎神的祭坛，昏眩转为濒死体验，朦胧间看见亚特莫克斯恶魔般恫吓的面容......\n\n三月十三日。我，约翰·米尔沃普，写下这个日期与姓名时带着古怪的迟疑。苏瓦拉药剂引发的幻象终结于鲜血流满符纹日晷、瞥见亚特莫克斯恐惧扭曲面容的一刻。这一切发生在另一个世界，与现世隔着无数生死轮回；然而我似乎并未完全从那双重古老的往昔归来。破碎却异常鲜活的记忆——那些幻象仅是片段——正压迫着我：赫斯坦的秘术残章、历史碎片、失落语言的词汇，不受控地浮现脑海。\n\n最甚者，卡拉斯帕的哀伤仍笼罩我心。他那在旁人看来不过梦中梦的绝望死灵术，如火焰烙在记忆黑页上。我知晓他所亵渎神明的可怖、所行恶魔仪式的污秽、以及令他昏厥的罪孽与绝望。这正是我毕生试图追忆、注定重历的过往。而对再次服药实验将揭示的更多真相，我怀着巨大恐惧。\n\n米尔沃普日记下一篇以奇特英文日期开头：\"红永劫第一千零九年，奥卡拉特月第二日\"。下方附有一行陌生字符，随后几行皆用异族语言书写，之后才无意识地转回英文。虽未提及再次服药实验，但显然已进行过，导致更多失落记忆复苏。\n\n......是何等深渊的天才诱使我行此之事，竟让我忽视了后果？诚然，当我为与贝尔索里斯唤回往昔秋日一小时，连带唤醒了整个赫斯坦世界与四轮太阳的过往时刻。众生从仲春退回深秋，仅保留被复活时刻前的记忆，对之后事件一无所知。而回归现世后，他们惊骇忆起反常的死灵术，恐惧与困惑笼罩众人，无人能解其意。\n\n短暂期间，亡者复生，落叶返枝，天体重归久弃的轨道，花朵缩回种子，植株退回根系。当永恒混乱植入所有周期后，时间才继续它迟滞的进程。\n\n此后宇宙天体的运行、未来的每一年每一瞬，都将偏离应有轨迹。我造成的错谬将结出无数恶果。太阳将迷失方位，世界与原子皆会稍稍偏离命定终点。\n\n亚特莫克斯为我止血后，正告诫我这些。在那重现的时光里，他也退回过去，重历了某件往事。于他，那是深入宅邸地下密室的时刻。他站在绘满五芒星的圈内，焚烧亵渎香料，诵念诅咒咒文，召出赫斯坦地腹的恶灵询问未来。但那如沥青浓烟般漆黑的灵体拒绝直言，以利爪狂怒冲击结界边缘，只说：\"你召我乃自取灭亡。咒语虽强，结界虽固，时空法则尚约束我向你泄愤。但或许你会在同一秋日同一时辰再次召我——届时时空法则将破裂，裂隙形成后，我终将穿越而来。\"\n\n说罢它焦躁绕行，如高举的乌黑火盆般俯视亚特莫克斯，獠牙密布的口器不时压向咒语屏障。最终他只得重复驱魔咒两遍才将其送离。\n\n花园中讲述时，亚特莫克斯浑身颤抖，目光搜寻高悬骄阳投下的狭长阴影，似在倾听某物掘地逼近的声响。\n\n奥卡拉特月第四日。怀着超越亚特莫克斯的恐惧，我独居卡鲁德城的宅邸。献祭泽克萨诺斯的失血仍使我虚弱，感官充满诡谲暗影，仆役如幽灵般往来，我几乎无视他们眼中的惨白恐惧或低语的恐怖见闻......他们称疯狂与混乱席卷卡鲁德，阿弗戈蒙神威震怒。因时间错乱，众生皆预感灾祸临头。\n\n今日午后他们带来亚特莫克斯的死讯。仆役屏息讲述：门徒听见他独坐巫术典籍间的密室爆发出风暴般的怒吼，其间短暂夹杂人类尖叫、香炉倾覆、桌椅典籍崩塌之声。鲜血从门缝下渗出，转瞬凝成拼写不可名讳者的邪恶符文。声响平息后，门徒久不敢入。最终闯入时，只见四壁与地板溅满鲜血，巫师袍碎片与撕毁的魔法书页、家具残骸与血肉碎块混杂，脑浆如可怖膏药涂抹在高耸天花板上。\n\n闻此我知亚特莫克斯恐惧的地底恶魔已穿越时空裂隙找到他。通过死灵术重现一小时造成的法则裂缝，这生物以不可知的方式抵达，使巫师的法力与学识全然失效......\n\n奥卡拉特月第五日。我确信亚特莫克斯未曾告密：此举等同自曝其罪......然而日落前，祭司们仍沉默阴郁地踏入我宅邸，目光回避如见不可名状之秽物。他们以嫌恶手势命我这同僚随行......\n\n他们就这样将我带离住所，沿着卡鲁德城的通衢大道走向西沉的落日。街道上杳无人迹，仿佛无人愿与渎神者相遇或对视......\n\n穿过日晷状石柱林立的甬道，我被引向阿弗戈蒙神殿那骇人的门廊——那些大张着的拱门宛如某种饕餮魔兽的巨口......\n\n奥卡拉特月第六日。他们将我投入神庙下方的地牢，那黑暗、恶臭、死寂的囚室中，唯有身旁令人发疯的规律滴水声作伴。我躺在那里，无从分辨黑夜与白昼的交替。唯有当看守者打开铁门，押解我前往审判庭时，光线才会渗入......\n\n......祭司们以可怖的齐声宣判我的罪孽，所有人的声调都融汇成难以分辨的轰鸣。年迈的大祭司赫尔佩诺高声呼唤阿弗戈蒙，自愿成为神祇的喉舌，祈求神明借他之口宣布足以惩戒我这般滔天罪行的判决。\n\n霎时间，神明显然已附体于赫尔佩诺；大祭司裹着法衣的身形诡异地膨胀；从他口中迸发的字句犹如九霄雷霆：\n\n\"噢，卡拉帕斯，你以邪恶的死灵法术扰乱了未来所有时辰与纪元的秩序。不仅如此，你还铸就了自己的厄运：你将永远被禁锢在非法复现的时辰里，脱离时间洪流中应有的位置。依照神圣律法，你将遭受烈焰锁链之刑：但莫以为这死亡能超越你真实惩罚的象征。此后你将在赫斯坦经历轮回，并在时空维度上攀至赫斯坦之后的寰宇循环中期。但你召唤的混沌将如不断扩大的裂隙永远追随你所有转世。生生世世，这道裂隙都将阻隔你与贝尔索里斯灵魂的重聚；生生世世，哪怕仅差一时辰，你都注定错过本可屡屡重获的爱恋。\"\n\n\"当裂隙扩张至无可挽回之际，你的灵魂将止步于轮回之环。那时你将清晰忆起古老的罪孽；在追忆中，你将湮灭于时间之外。你最后那具躯体上将浮现锁链的焦痕，作为永恒奴役的终焉印记。但认识你之人将迅速遗忘，你的存在将完全局限于罪孽划定的轮回中。\"\n\n三月二十九日。我以无尽的绝望写下这个日期，试图说服自己存在着二十世纪地球上那个名为约翰·米尔沃普的个体。连续两日未服索瓦拉药剂，我却两次重返阿弗戈蒙神庙的地牢，目睹祭司卡拉帕斯等待末日的景象。两次我都沉溺在那潭死水般的黑暗中，听着身旁缓慢的滴水声，如同为受诅者计量黑暗纪元的漏壶。\n\n此刻在书房伏案疾书时，仿佛有亘古的午夜在拉扯灯焰。书柜化作渗着夜露的石墙。书桌不复存在...执笔之人亦消逝...我呼吸着地牢的浊臭，那深埋于失落世界、永不见天日的墓穴气息。\n\n奥卡拉特月第十八日。今日他们最后一次将我提出囚室。赫尔佩诺与另外三人引我前往神明的圣所。我们穿过普通信徒无从知晓的广阔地窟，深入外层神殿之下的深渊。无人言语，无人与我交换眼神；他们似乎已视我为遭时间放逐、被遗忘吞噬的幽魂。\n\n最终抵达传说中阿弗戈蒙之灵栖息的断崖。零星微光如宇宙边缘的星辰环绕深渊，却照不透下方黑暗。刽子手们将我安置在悬于恐怖断崖的石座上，用沉重的黑铁锁链——那些永不锈蚀的金属环——将我从头到脚、四肢躯干层层缠绕，链条另一端深深楔入岩床。\n\n此前亦有异端与渎神者承受此刑...但无人犯下我这般罪孽。受刑者被锁缚后，需静候指定时限以忏悔罪行——或许还会直面阿弗戈蒙的黑暗神性。最终，从他被迫凝视的深渊中会升起光芒，一道异色火柱将窜出，击中缠绕的锁链使其瞬间白炽化。这火焰的源头与本质始终成谜，多数人相信它源自神明而非凡俗之力......\n\n他们就这样弃我而去。沉重的链环早已深陷血肉，化作持续煎熬。凝视深渊引发的眩晕令我难以自持——却又无法坠落。下方不可测的深处，间歇传来空洞而庄严的声响。或许是地下水的叹息...或许是徘徊洞窟的风...又或是蛰伏黑暗者的呼吸，以气息丈量缓慢流逝的分秒、时辰、昼夜、纪元......我的恐惧已沉重过锁链，眩晕源于双重深渊的撕扯......\n\n万古流逝，诸界如坠入裂隙的浮木般归于虚无，带走了贝尔索里斯消逝的容颜。我悬于暗影巨口之上......某个异界的流亡幽魂写下了这些文字...一个必将彻底湮灭于时空的幻影，正如我，被诅咒的祭司卡拉帕斯。我已记不起那个幽魂的名字。\n\n下方漆黑的深渊里，可怖的辉光正在涌现......"

        "title": "The Treader of the Dust",
        "content": "\n\n…The olden wizards knew him, and named him Quachil Uttaus. Seldom is he revealed: for he dwelleth beyond the outermost circle, in the dark limbo of unsphered time and space.-Dreadful is the word that calleth him, though the word be unspoken save in thought: For Quachil Uttaus is the ultimate corruption; and the instant of his coming is like the passage of many ages; and neither flesh nor stone may abide his treading, but all things crumble beneath-it atom from atom. And for this, some have called him The Treader of the Dust.\n\n—The Testaments of Carnamagos.\n\nIt was-after interminable debate and argument with himself, after many attempts-to. exorcise the dim, bodiless legion of his fears, that John Sebastian returned to the house-he had left so hurriedly. He had been absent only for three. days; but even this was an interruption without precedent in the life of reclusion and study to which he had given himself completely following his inheritance of the old Mansion together with a generous income. At no time would he have defined fully the reason of his flight: nevertheless, flight had seemed imperative. There was some horrible urgency that had driven him forth; but now, since had determined to go back,. the urgency was resolved into a matter. of nerves overwrought by too close and prolonged application to his books. He had fancied certain things: but the fancies were patently absurd and baseless.\n\nEven if the phenomena that had perturbed-him were not all imaginary, there must be some natural solution that had not occurred to his overheated mind at the-time. The sudden. yellowing-of a newly purchased notebook, the crumbling of the-sheets at their edges, Were no doubt. due-to a latent imperfection of the paper; and the queer fading of his entries, which, almost overnight, had become faint. as age-old writing, was clearly the result of cheap, faulty chemicals in the ink. The aspect of sheer, brittle, worm-hollowed antiquity which had manifested itself in certain articles of furniture, certain portions of the mansion, was no more than the sudden revealing of a covert disintegration that had gone on unnoticed by him in his sedulous application to dark but absorbing researches. And it was this same application, with its unbroken years of toil and confinement, which had brought about his premature aging; so that, looking back into the mirror on the morn of his flight, .he had been startled and shocked as if by the apparition of a withered mummy. As to the manservant, Timmers - well, Timmers had been old ever since he could remember. It was only the exaggeration of sick nerves that had lately found in Timmers a decrepitude so extreme that it might fall, without the intermediacy of death, at any moment, into the corruption of the grave.\n\nIndeed, he could explain all that had troubled him without reference to the wild,. remote lore, the forgotten demonologies and systems into which he had delved. Those passages in The Testaments of Carnamagos, over which he had pondered with weird dismay, were relevant only to the horrors evoked by mad sorcerers in bygone eons.\n\nSebastian, firm in such convictions, came-back at sunset to his house. He did not tremble or falter as he crossed the pine-darkened grounds and ran quickly up the front steps. He fancied, but could not be sure, that there were fresh signs of dilapidation in the steps; and the house itself, as he approached it, had seemed to lean a little aslant, as if from some ruinous settling of the foundations: but this, he told himself, was an illusion wrought by the. gathering twilight.\n\nNo lamps had been lit, but Sebastian was not unduly surprised by this, for he knew that Timmers, left to his own devices, was prone to dodder about in the gloom like a senescent owl, long after the proper time of lamp-lighting. Sebastian, on the other hand, had always been averse to darkness or even-deep shadow; and of-late the aversion had increased upon him. Invariably he turned on all the bulbs in the house as soon as the daylight began to fail. Now muttering his irritation at Timmers' remissness, he pushed open the door and reached hurriedly for the hall switch.\n\nBecause, perhaps, of a nervous agitation which he would not own to himself, he fumbled for several moments without finding the knob. The hall-was strangely dark, and a glimmering from the ashen sunset, sifted between tall pines into the doorway behind him, was seemingly powerless to penetrate beyond its threshold. He could see .nothing; it was as if the-night of dead ages-had laired in that hallway; and his nostrils, while he stood groping, were. assailed by a dry pungency as of ancient dust, an odor as of corpses and coffins long indistinguishable in powdery decay.\n\nAt last he found the switch; but the illumination that responded was somehow dim and insufficient, and he seemed to detect a shadowy flickering, as if the circuit were at fault. However, it reassured him to see that the. house, to all appearance, was very much as he had left it. Perhaps, unconsciously, he had feared to find the oaken panels crumbling away in riddled rottenness, the carpet falling into moth-eaten tatters; had apprehended the breaking through of rotted boards beneath his tread.\n\nWhere, he wondered now, was Timmers? The aged factotum, in. spite of his growing senility, had .always been. quick to appear; and even if he had not heard his master enter, the switching on of the lights would have signalized Sebastian's return to him. But,- though Sebastian listened with painful intentness, there was no creaking of the familiar tottery footsteps. Silence hung everywhere, like a funereal, unstirred arras.\n\nNo doubt, Sebastian thought, there was some. common place explanation. Timmers had gone to-the nearby village, perhaps to restock the larder, or in hope of receiving a letter from his master; and Sebastian had missed him on the way home from the station. Or perhaps the old. man had fallen ill and was now lying helpless in his room. Filled with this latter thought, he went straight to Timmers' bedchamber, which was on the ground floor, at the back of the mansion. It was empty, and the bed was neatly made and had obviously not been occupied since the night before. With a suspiration of relief that seemed to lift a horrid ..incubus from his bosom, he decided that his first conjecture had been correct.\n\nNow, pending the return of Timmers, he nerved .himself to another act of inspection, and went forthwith into his study. He would not admit to himself precisely what it was that he had feared to see; but at first glance, the room was unchanged, and all things were as they. had been at the time of his flurried departure. The confused and high-piled litter of manuscripts, volumes, notebooks on his writing-table had seemingly lain untouched by anything but his own hand; and his bookshelves, with their bizarre and terrifical array of authorities on diabolism, necromancy, goety, on all the ridiculed or outlawed sciences, were undisturbed and intact. On the old lecturn or reading-stand which he used for his heavier tomes, The Testaments of Carnamagos, in its covers of shagreen with hasps of human bone, lay open at the very page which had frightened him so unreasonably with its eldritch intimations.\n\nThen, as he stepped forward between the reading-stand and the table, he perceived for the-first time the inexplicable dustiness of everything. Dust lay everywhere: a fine gray dust like a powder of dead atoms. It had .covered his manuscripts with a deep film, it had settled thickly upon the chairs, the lamp-shades, the volumes; and the rich poppy-like reds and yellows of the oriental rugs were-bedimmed by its accumulation. It was as if many desolate years had passed through the chamber since his own departure, and had shaken from their shroud-like garments the dust of all ruined things. The mystery of it chilled Sebastian: for he knew that the room had been clean-swept only three days previously; and Timmers would have-dusted the place each morning with meticulous care during his absence.\n\nNow the dust rose up in a light, swirling cloud about him, it filled his nostrils with the same dry odor, as of fantastically ancient dissolution, that had met him in the hall. At the same moment he grew aware of a cold gusty draft that had somehow entered the room. He though that one of the windows must have been left open but a glance assured him that they. were shut, with tightly drawn blinds; and the door was closed behind him. The draft was light as the sighing of a phantom, but wherever it ,passed, the fine weightless powder soared aloft, filling the air and settling again with utmost slowness. Sebastian felt-a weird alarm, as if a wind had blown upon him from chartless dimensions, or through some hidden rift of ruin; and .simultaneously he was seized by a paroxysm of prolonged .and violent coughing.\n\nHe could not locate the source of the draft. But as he moved restlessly about. his eye was caught by a low long mound of the gray dust which had heretofore been hidden from view by the table. It lay beside the chair in. which he usually sat while writing. Near the heap was the feather-duster used by Timmers in his daily round of house-cleaning.\n\nIt seemed to Sebastian that the rigor of a great, lethal coldness had invaded all his being. He could not stir for several minutes, but stood peering down at the inexplicable mound. In the center of that mound he saw a vague depression, which might have been the mark of a very small footprint half erased by-the gusts of air that had evidently taken much of the dust and scattered it about the chamber.\n\nAt last the power of motion returned to-Sebastian. Without conscious recognition of the impulse that prompted him, he bent forward to pick up the feather-duster. But even as his fingers touched it, the handle and the feathers crumbled into fine 'powder which, settling in a low pile, preserved vaguely the outlines-of the, original object.\n\nA weakness came upon Sebastian, as if the burden of utter age and mortality had gathered crushingly on his shoulders between one instant and the next. There was a whirling of vertiginous shadows-before his eyes in the lamplight, and he felt that he should swoon unless he sat down immediately. He put out his hand to reach the chair beside him — and the chair, at his touch, fell instantly into light, downward-sifting clouds of dust.\n\nAfterward — how long afterward he could not tell — he found himself sitting in the high chair before the lecture on which The Testaments of Carnamagos lay open. Dimly he was surprised that the seat had not crumbled beneath him. Upon him, as once before, there was the urgency of swift, sudden flight from that accursed house: but it seemed that he had grown too old, too weary and feeble; and that nothing mattered greatly — not even the grisly doom which he apprehended.\n\nNow, as he sat there in a state half terror, half stupor, his eyes were drawn to the wizard volume before him: the writings of that evil sage and seer, Carnamagos, which had been recovered a thousand years agone from some Graeco-Bactrian tomb,-and transcribed by an apostate monk in the original Greek, in the blood of an incubus-begottten monster. In that volume were the chronicles of great sorcerers of old, and the histories of demons earthly and ultra-cosmic, and the veritable spells by which the demons. could be called up and controlled and dismissed. Sebastian, a profound student of-such lore, had long believed that the book was a mere. medieval legend.; and he had been. startled as well as gratified when he found this copy on the shelves of a dealer in old manuscripts and incunabula. It was said-that only two-copies had ever existed, and that the other had been destroyed by the Spanish Inquisition early in the Thirteenth Century.\n\nThe light flickered as if ominous wings had flown across it; and: Sebastian's eyes blurred with a gathering rheum as he read again that sinister fatal passage which had served to provoke shadowy fears:\n\n'Though Quachil Uttaus cometh-but rarely, it had been well attested that his advent is not always in response to the spoken rune and the drawn—pentacle... Few-wizard. indeed would call upon a spirit so baleful. . . But-let it be understood that he who readeth to himself in the silence of his chamber, the formula given hereunder, must incur a grave risk if in his heart there abide openly or hidden the least desire of death and annihilation. For it may-be that Quachil Uttaus will come to him, bringing that doom which toucheth the body to eternal dust, and maketh the soul as a vapor for evermore dissolved. And the-.advent of Quachill Uttaus is foreknowable by certain tokens; for in the person of the evocator, and even perchance in. those about him, will appear the signs of sudden age; and his house, and those belongings which he hath touched,-will assume the marks of untimely decay and antiquity. . .'\n\nSebastian did not know that he was mumbling. the sentences half aloud as he read them; that he was also mumbling the terrible incantation that followed .... His thoughts crawled as if through a chill and freezing medium. With a dull, ghastly certainty, he knew Timmers had not gone to the village. He should have warned Timmers before leaving; he should have closed and locked The Testaments of Carnamagos... for Timmers, in his way, was some thing. of a scholar and .was-not without curiosity concerning the occult studies of-his master. Timmers was well able to read the Greek of Carnamagos... even that dire and soul blasting formula to which Quachil Uttaus, demon of ultimate corruption, would respond from the outer void.... Too well Sebastian divined the origin of the gray dust, the reason of those mysterious crumblings ....\n\nAgain he felt the impulse of flight: but his body was a dry dead incubus that refused to obey his-volition. Anyway, he reflected, it was too late now, for the signs of doom had gathered about him and upon him... Yet, surely-there had never been in. his heart the least longing for death and destruction. He had wished only to pursue his delvings into the blacker mysteries that environed the mortal estate. And he had always been cautious, had never cared to meddle with magic circles and evocations of perilous presences. He had known that there were spirits of evil, spirits of wrath, perdition, annihilation: but never, of his own will, should he have summoned any of .them from their night-bound abysms. . .\n\nHis lethargy and weakness seemed to increase: it was as if whole lustrums, whole decades of senescence had fallen upon him in the drawing of a breath. The thread of his thoughts was broken at intervals, and he recovered it with difficulty. His memories, even his fears, seemed to totter on the edge of some final forgetfulness. With dulled ears he heard a sound as of timbers breaking and falling somewhere in the house; with dimmed eyes like those of an ancient he saw the lights waver and go out beneath the swooping of a bat-black darkness.\n\nIt was as if the night of some crumbing catacomb had closed .upon him. He felt at whiles the chill faint breathing of the draft that had troubled him before with its mystery; and again the dust rose up in his nostrils. Then he realized that the room was not wholly dark, for he could discern the dim outlines of the lecturn before him. Surely no ray was admitted by the drawn window-blinds: yet somehow there was light. His eyes, lifting with enormous effort, saw for the first time that a rough, irregular gap had appeared in the room's outer wall, high up in the north comer. Through it a single star shone into the chamber, cold and remote as the eye of a demon glaring across intercosmic gulfs.\n\nOut of that star - or from the spaces beyond it - a beam of livid radiance, wan and deathly, was hurled like a spear upon Sebastian. Broad as a plank, unwavering, immovable, it seemed to tranfix his very body and to form a bridge between himself and the worlds of unimagined darkness.\n\nHe was as one petrified by the gaze of the Gorgon. Then, through the aperture of ruin, there came something that glided stiffly and rapidly into the room toward him, along the beam. The wall seemed to crumble, the rift widened as it entered.\n\nIt was a figure no larger than a young child, but sere and shriveled as some millennial mummy. Its hairless head, its unfeatured face, borne on a neck of skeleton thinness, were lined with a thousand reticulated wrinkles. The body was like that of some monstrous, withered abortion that had never drawn breath. The pipy arms, ending in bony claws were outthrust as if ankylosed in the posture. of an eternal dreadful groping. The legs, with feet like those of a pigmy Death, were drawn tightly together as though confined by the swathings of the tomb; nor was there any movement or striding or pacing. Upright. and rigid, the horror floated swiftly down the wan, deathly gray beam toward Sebastian.\n\nNow it was close upon him, its head level with his brow and its feet opposite his bosom. For a fleeting moment he knew that the horror had touched him with its outflung hands, with its starkly floating feet. It seemed to merge with him, to become one with his being. He felt that his veins were choked with dust, that his brain was crumbling cell by cell. Then he was no longer John Sebastian, but a universe of dead stars and worlds that fell eddying into darkness before the tremendous blowing of 'some ultrastellar wind ....\n\nThe thing that immemorial wizards had named Quachil Uttaus was gone; and night and starlight had returned to that ruinous chamber. But nowhere was there any shadow of John Sebastian: only a low mound of dust on the floor beside the lecturn, bearing a vague depression like the imprint of a small foot ... or of two feet that were pressed closely together.",
        "content_cn": "……远古的巫师们知晓祂，称祂为夸奇尔·乌陶斯。祂鲜少显现：因祂栖居于最外层圆环之外，在那无球体时空的黑暗边缘。召唤祂的咒语令人毛骨悚然，尽管这咒语仅存于意念而未曾出口：因夸奇尔·乌陶斯即是终极的腐朽；祂降临的刹那如同千万纪元的流逝；凡血肉与岩石皆无法承受祂的践踏，万物将在其足下分崩离析——原子与原子分离。因此，有人称祂为\"尘埃践踏者\"。\n\n——《卡纳玛戈斯圣约》\n\n在与内心无尽的争辩后，在多次试图驱散那些朦胧无形、如军团般盘踞的恐惧后，约翰·塞巴斯蒂安回到了那座他仓皇逃离的宅邸。他仅离开了三天；但这段中断在他隐居研习的生活中已属空前——自继承这座古宅与丰厚遗产后，他便全心投入其中。他始终无法完全解释自己逃离的缘由：然而逃离似乎势在必行。某种可怖的紧迫感驱使他出走；但此刻，当他决意归来时，那紧迫感已消解为过度沉浸书卷导致的神经衰弱。他曾幻想过某些事：但这些幻想显然荒诞无稽。\n\n即便困扰他的现象并非全是幻觉，也必定存在某种他当时过度亢奋的头脑未能想到的自然解释。新购笔记本的突然泛黄、纸页边缘的碎裂，无疑源于纸张的潜在缺陷；而笔记文字的诡异褪色——几乎一夜之间变得如古老字迹般模糊——显然是劣质墨水所致。某些家具与宅邸局部显现出的脆弱虫蛀般的古旧面貌，不过是他埋头于晦暗却引人入胜的研究时，未曾注意的隐秘朽坏突然暴露。正是这经年累月闭门苦修的生活，导致了他过早衰老；以致逃亡那日清晨，他在镜中惊见一具枯萎木乃伊般的面容。至于老仆蒂默斯——自他记事起蒂默斯就已垂垂老矣。近来在病态神经的夸大下，蒂默斯的衰朽才显得如此极端，仿佛随时可能不经历死亡直接坠入坟墓的腐坏。\n\n诚然，他无需借助那些荒远秘术、遭遗忘的恶魔学体系——那些他曾钻研的领域——就能解释所有困扰。他在《卡纳玛戈斯圣约》中反复揣摩的骇人段落，仅与远古疯癫巫师召唤的可怖存在相关。\n\n塞巴斯蒂安带着这般坚定信念，于日落时分回到宅邸。穿过松林阴影笼罩的庭院、快步踏上台阶时，他并未颤抖或迟疑。台阶似有新近破损的迹象——这或许是他的错觉；而当他接近宅邸时，整栋建筑仿佛微微倾斜，如同地基正在塌陷：但他告诉自己，这是暮色造成的幻觉。\n\n厅内未点灯，塞巴斯蒂安并不十分惊讶，因他知晓蒂默斯若无人指使，常如衰老猫头鹰般在黑暗中蹒跚，远超过正常掌灯时分。而塞巴斯蒂安素来厌恶黑暗乃至深重阴影；近来这种厌恶愈发强烈。往日天色初暗他就会点亮全宅灯火。此刻他低声抱怨蒂默斯的疏忽，推开门匆忙摸索走廊开关。\n\n或许因他不愿承认的神经紧张，他摸索许久才找到旋钮。走廊异常黑暗，灰暗暮光从身后高耸松林间渗入门框，却似乎无力穿透门槛。他什么也看不见；仿佛亘古长夜正盘踞在这条走廊；当他站立摸索时，鼻腔袭来一阵干燥刺鼻的气味——如陈年尘埃，如早已在粉状朽坏中难辨形骸的尸棺。\n\n终于他触到开关；但亮起的灯光却莫名昏暗不足，电路似乎故障般闪烁不定。然而宅邸大体如他离开时的模样，这让他稍感安心。或许潜意识里，他害怕会看见橡木镶板蛀蚀崩裂、地毯化作虫蛀破布、脚下地板突然塌陷。\n\n蒂默斯在何处？这位日渐迟钝的老仆向来反应迅速；即便未听见主人归来，灯光亮起也该知晓塞巴斯蒂安已返。但塞巴斯蒂安凝神倾听，却无熟悉的蹒跚脚步声。寂静如丧葬帷幔般笼罩一切。\n\n塞巴斯蒂安推测必有寻常解释。蒂默斯可能去了附近村庄采购，或期盼主人来信；而塞巴斯蒂安从车站归途错过了他。又或老人病倒房中。怀着后一种猜想，他径直前往宅邸底层后部的蒂默斯卧室。房间空荡，床铺整洁显然昨夜无人使用。他如释重负地长舒一气，仿佛胸腔移走了可怖梦魇，认定第一种猜测属实。\n\n趁蒂默斯未归，他强打精神继续查看，立即走向书房。他不愿承认自己究竟害怕看见什么；但乍看之下房间毫无变化，与他仓促离开时无异。写字台上堆积的手稿、典籍、笔记本看似仅经他之手；书架上那些关于恶魔学、死灵术、邪术及一切遭嘲弄或禁绝的恐怖典籍依然整齐完好。用于放置厚重典籍的老式读经台上，《卡纳玛戈斯圣约》正摊开在那页——那页以其诡谲暗示令他莫名恐惧的篇章——覆盖着鲨革封皮与人类骨扣。\n\n当他从读经台与书桌间走过时，才首次察觉无处不在的诡异尘埃。细密的灰色尘埃如死寂原子的粉末覆盖一切：手稿蒙上厚厚尘膜，椅子、灯罩、书册积满尘灰；东方地毯上罂粟般的红黄色泽在尘积下黯淡无光。仿佛他离开后，无数荒芜岁月已穿过这房间，从裹尸布般的衣袍抖落万物残骸的尘埃。这谜团令塞巴斯蒂安寒彻骨髓：因他知晓三天前房间还一尘不染；他不在时蒂默斯本该每日精心拂拭。\n\n此刻尘埃在他周围旋舞升腾，鼻腔再度充满走廊里那种如远古崩解般的干燥气息。同时他觉察到一股阴冷气流莫名涌入房间。他以为某扇窗户未关，但环顾确认所有窗户紧闭且遮光帘严实；身后房门也已关闭。气流如幽灵叹息般微弱，但所经之处，那些轻盈粉末便腾空而起，缓慢沉降。塞巴斯蒂安感到诡异的警兆，仿佛有风从未知维度或某处隐秘的废墟裂隙吹来；与此同时，一阵剧烈持久的咳嗽攫住了他。\n\n他找不到气流来源。但当焦躁踱步时，书桌后一处此前被遮挡的灰色尘堆引起他注意。尘堆旁是他惯用的写作座椅。附近躺着蒂默斯日常打扫用的羽毛掸。\n\n某种致命寒意似乎侵入了塞巴斯蒂安全身。他僵立数分钟无法动弹，凝视着那堆不可解的尘埃。尘堆中央有个模糊凹陷，可能是个极小的足迹——显然已被气流抹去大半，并将大量尘埃吹散室内各处。\n\n终于塞巴斯蒂安恢复了行动力。在某种无意识冲动驱使下，他弯腰拾起羽毛掸。但指尖触碰瞬间，掸柄与羽毛便化作齑粉，堆成与原物轮廓依稀相似的尘堆。\n\n一阵虚弱袭向塞巴斯蒂安，仿佛刹那间衰老与死亡的重负已压垮他的肩膀。灯光下晕眩的阴影在他眼前旋转，他感到若不立即坐下就会昏厥。他伸手去扶身旁座椅——触碰瞬间，椅子立即化作簌簌坠落的尘雾。\n\n不知过了多久，他发现自己坐在读经台前的高背椅上，《卡纳玛戈斯圣约》仍摊开着。椅子竟未在他身下粉碎，这让他隐约惊讶。如同先前那般，逃离这受诅咒宅邸的迫切感再度袭来：但他似乎已过于衰老、疲惫、虚弱；一切都不再重要——甚至包括他预感中的恐怖结局。\n\n此刻他半是恐惧半是麻木地坐着，目光被面前那本邪恶典籍吸引——记载着恶毒先知晓卡纳玛戈斯著述的典籍，千年前某座希腊-巴克特里亚古墓出土，由叛教僧侣用梦魇所生怪物的血誊写于希腊文原稿上。书中记载着古代伟大巫师的事迹，尘世与超宇宙恶魔的历史，以及召唤、控制、驱逐这些恶魔的真实咒语。作为此类学问的渊博学者，塞巴斯蒂安曾长期认为此书仅是中世纪传说；当他在古籍商架上发现这个抄本时，既惊且喜。据说此书仅存两册，另一册早于十三世纪被西班牙宗教裁判所销毁。\n\n灯光如被不祥羽翼掠过般闪烁；当塞巴斯蒂安再次读到那段引发幽暗恐惧的致命文字时，眼中积聚的黏液模糊了视线：\n\n\"虽夸奇尔·乌陶斯鲜少降临，然其到来并非总因咒语与五芒星召唤...鲜有巫师胆敢召唤如此恶灵...但需知，若有人在静室默念下述咒文，而其心中——无论显隐——存有丝毫死亡与湮灭之欲，必将招致大险。因夸奇尔·乌陶斯或会降临，赐予肉身永化尘埃、灵魂永恒消散之劫。且夸奇尔·乌陶斯之临现有预兆：召唤者及其周遭之人将突现衰老之相；其宅邸及所触之物，皆会呈现早衰与古旧之迹...\"\n\n塞巴斯蒂安未察觉自己正半出声地喃喃诵读这些句子；也未察觉自己正念出其后那道恐怖咒文...他的思绪如在冰寒介质中爬行。带着钝重的可怕确信，他明白蒂默斯并未去村庄。他本该在离开前警告蒂默斯；本该合上并锁起《卡纳玛戈斯圣约》...因蒂默斯某种程度上也算学者，对主人的秘术研究不乏好奇。蒂默斯完全能读懂卡纳玛戈斯的希腊文...甚至那段令夸奇尔·乌陶斯——终极腐朽之恶魔——从外层虚空中回应的、摧魂蚀魄的咒文...塞巴斯蒂安太过清楚地猜到了灰色尘埃的来历，那些神秘崩解的原因...\n\n逃离的冲动再度涌现：但他的身躯如干枯死寂的梦魇般拒绝服从意志。无论如何，他思忖现在为时已晚，毁灭的征兆已笼罩他与周遭...然而他心中确实从未有过丝毫死亡与毁灭的渴望。他只愿探究凡人境遇周边的幽暗奥秘。他一向谨慎，从不涉足魔法阵或危险存在的召唤仪式。他知晓存在邪恶之灵、愤怒之灵、毁灭之灵、湮灭之灵：但若非自愿，他绝不会从黑夜深渊召唤任何一位...\n\n他的昏沉与虚弱似乎加剧：仿佛每一次呼吸都带来整段衰老岁月。思绪不时中断，艰难才能续接。记忆乃至恐惧，都似将坠入终极遗忘的边缘。迟钝的耳中传来宅邸某处木材断裂倒塌的声响；如古人般昏花的双眼看见灯光在蝙蝠般的漆黑扑袭下摇曳熄灭。\n\n仿佛某座崩塌墓穴的黑夜已将他吞没。他时而感受到先前那神秘气流的冰冷吐息；尘埃再度涌入鼻腔。随后他意识到房间并非全然黑暗，因他能辨出读经台的模糊轮廓。遮光帘确实未透入任何光线：但某种光源确实存在。当他竭力抬眼，首次看见房间北墙高处出现了一道粗糙裂口。一颗孤星透过裂口照入室内，冰冷遥远如恶魔跨越宇宙深渊的凝视。\n\n自那颗星——或更远的虚空——一道惨白死光如长矛刺向塞巴斯蒂安。如木板般宽阔、稳定、不可撼动，这光束似乎贯穿他的躯体，在他与不可想象的黑暗世界间架起桥梁。\n\n他如被戈耳工凝视般石化。随后，通过废墟的裂口，某物沿着光束僵硬而迅疾地滑入房间向他逼近。墙壁似乎在崩塌，裂口随那物的进入而扩大。\n\n那形体不大于幼童，却如千年木乃伊般干枯皱缩。无发的头颅与无面的脸庞由骷髅般纤细的脖颈支撑，布满千道网状皱纹。身躯如同某种从未呼吸过的畸形干瘪怪胎。竹节般的双臂末端是骨爪，如永恒可怖摸索的姿势般僵直前伸。双腿如侏儒死神的脚般紧紧并拢，似被裹尸布束缚；不见任何迈步动作。这恐怖之物直立僵挺，沿惨白死灰的光束向塞巴斯蒂安疾速飘来。\n\n此刻它已逼近，头颅与他前额平齐，双脚对着他胸膛。瞬息间他知晓这恐怖之物已用伸展的手爪与僵直的足尖触碰到他。它似乎与他融合，成为他存在的一部分。他感到血管被尘埃堵塞，脑细胞正逐个崩解。随后他不再是约翰·塞巴斯蒂安，而是一个由死寂星辰与世界组成的宇宙，在某种超星际之风的吹拂下，旋转着坠入黑暗...\n\n那被远古巫师们称为夸奇尔·乌陶斯的可怖存在已然消逝；黑夜与星光再度笼罩了这座倾颓的密室。然而约翰·塞巴斯蒂安的形影却无处可寻：唯有讲经台旁地板上隆起的一小堆灰烬，上面凹陷着模糊的痕迹，宛若一只纤小足印……又像是两只紧贴在一起的脚。"
